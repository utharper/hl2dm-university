					<p>The forum database has been kindly donated by Da11aS, and <strike>upgraded to a modern format</strike> converted into a read-only archive. The old website banner was too low-res for the forum software, so I recreated it in the same style. Thanks to this new banner, I've also increased the page width slightly to better suit modern displays.

                    <h5>January 31st, 2009</h5>
                    <p>As we roll on into 2009, there are a few new things going on. First of all, we now have a web based chat client that puts you right into the #hl2dm IRC channel where you can chat with members of the community and request matches. To
                        access this, just click the "Chat" in our menu, enter a name and start chatting.</p>
                    <p>Our second Map Contest is now well underway. There is still time to submit a map, the deadline is Feb 28th. For more info check out the rules.</p>
                    <p>As usual, people continue to say the HL2DM community is dead. Keep in mind, people have been saying that for almost three years, and yep, we are still here. In fact, if you still enjoy HL2DM, the less active the pub scene becomes the
                        more important other channels are for getting games. Stick around, HL2DMU isn't going anywhere for a while.</p>

                    <h5>March 5th, 2008</h5>
                    <p>HL2DMU Forums have been updated to a new version. If the forums appear disabled, please update your bookmarks and/or clear your browser cache and cookies. If you continue to see a disabled board, please let us know by emailing siteadmin@hl2dm-university.com.</p>

                    <h5>January 3rd, 2008</h5>
                    <p>
                        We are proud to announce that HL2DMU will be merging with hl2plugins.com this weekend. This collaboration is one that we feel will be mutually beneficial by:
                        <br>
                        <br> A) <i>Bringing those visiting hl2plugins.com to HL2DMU</i>
                        <br>
                        <br> and
                        <br>
                        <br> B) <i>Exposing and getting the HL2DMU community more involved in Keeper's work</i>
                        <br>
                        <br> Overall, we feel this will create a more unified community. HL2DMU strongly supports Keeper's work, and this merge further strengthens our commitment to "promoting better servers by providing useful information to the server admin
                        community".
                        <br>
                        <br> Keeper will move his content to this domain, and in doing so he will join me as co-admin of the site. In addition to Keeper being an existing Board Member and having an extensive knowledge of the back-end of the game, he also
                        brings a great deal of technical expertise the site. We feel this is a positive step for the community, and we hope everyone here will support it.

                        If you haven't already, please join the HL2DMU steam community group, and help us out by sending invites to your friends:

                        <br>
                        <br> This website exists not just to bring together the community, but to try to keep the game active and growing in the face of new games being released, and a shortage of attention from Valve. In order to do this, we need more involvement
                        from the community.
                        <br>
                        <br> Remember, this site is not a clan, nor is it seeking server traffic. It is made by the community for the community, the goal being that HL2DM stays strong and active in both the competitive and pub scenes.

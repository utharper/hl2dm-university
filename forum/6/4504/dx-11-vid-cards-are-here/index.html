As of now there is only one that I have heard about battleforge or something (looks kinda lame) and the only other game announced that will eventually support dx11 is the new alien vs predator due out 2010 sometime. Hopefully some other games in the works will go dx11 soon.<br>

Reading anything at semiaccurate is like reading something in the national enquirer or any other tabloid bs, Hard OCP went to Nvidia with that story and they said it was completely false.<br>
In any case Nvidia will have a new card (300) series out after the first of the year and expect it to whoop on ATI as usual.<br>
<br>
 I do commend ATI for getting this card out before the holiday season and it having good performance but from the tests I have seen it does not go far above Nvidias current cards just slightly (5870). As always its just a back and forth war between the two companies, too bad to get that extra performance they had to make it so big limiting the amount of people who can use it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
This is true.<br>
What I mean by Nvidia being the leader is that Nvidia has been the first with new technologies such as SLI, dual gpu cards ect, as well as always the first to introduce new drivers/profiles supporting the newest games. <br>
If you looked at the cards over the last decade Nvidia's held the advantage more than 50% of the time over ATI. That being said I wouldnt say I'm a fanboy I just go for who has shown best performance overall or who has the best product at the time I'm doing a build. I may even buy one of these 5870's for a new build I'm doing now as it appears to be the best card at the moment.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ati lost its lead way before the 8800 series, in fact I'd say it was more like back around the 6600 series but for sure by the 7800 series<br>
The intel chipset was no big loss anyway as Nforce was the way to go when SLI first came out, as well as AMD cpu's, three to four years after SLI intel regained the CPU title and only then did it matter.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

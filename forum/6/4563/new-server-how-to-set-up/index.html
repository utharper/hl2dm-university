	<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I just got a server, but I'm not sure how to go about setting it up with the things I want. Some tips on which plug-ins will cover which functions would be appreciated  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Things I like/want/need:</span><br>
- hitreg sounds, with a different sounds for hits to the body and head (Keeper, how do I know to use VSP or SourceMM?)<br>
- votemap<br>
- votekick/voteban that DO NOT WORK but rather redirects to submitting a complaint right then and there<br>
- some other command to access above complaint tool<br>
- simple admin interface for kicking/banning, with ability to set ban expiry time<br>
- chat filtering, or warning with possible autokick/ban for repeat abuse<br>
- muting players<br>
- chat protection<br>
- autokick idle players after certain time<br>
- anti-cheat/hax<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Things I do not need/want/like:</span><br>
- actual working votekick/voteban<br>
- "fun player management" etc.<br>
- Quake sounds<br>
- stat logging<br>
- music/radio<br>
- extra blood<br>
<br>
Dunno if it makes a difference, it's a gameservers.com server.<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot for any info!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">mani will take care of most of those things you want, prolly all of them.  but you will need some tweaking after you install it.  you can also disable those options you dont want.  I would give Frank in Boston a shout.  he has a lot of this stuff set up on his server already and would be able to help you out with the mani tweaking.   you could also ask one of the skull shock guys, they seem to have a lot of cool sounds on their servers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for your suggestions, guys. I tried mani for a short time but quickly got rid of it as I noticed player models disappeared once in a while. I've kinda ignored my server since I started it but now I'm interested again in setting it up nice. Still looking for a good chat filter. Anyone had experience with <a href="http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=71674" class="postlink">http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=71674</a> ? Do you reckon it would slow my server?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No I did not get a dx11 this was a very long time ago when I upgraded from an X800XL to a 8800GTS, I no longer use either of those cards. <br>
<br>
To me it is really sad I really do not get why so many server ops find they need to install these plugins. Most of them do not even use the plugins at all. It is sort of just that odd bit of human nature where everyone got to mess with something right away. Or they are only using 1 feature of the plugin and its pretty stupid all the lag and models disappearing that you have to put up with just to get 1 stupid feature.<br>
<br>
I guess the real crime is that valve has never in over a decade of making these games just put some basic server administration features into the game so people can get rid of  the plugins. It would carry to every game and be one of those things you coded once and hardly ever had to touch.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lack of gpu resources to render them, usually caused by visually overdone and/or poorly optimised maps (excessive particle effects in one visleaf etc). A stronger card can overcome this to an extent, but its fairly easy for a greedy or bad mapper to take the bsp to the point of no return where no level of pc power can counter the sheer amount of crap that wants to be rendered simultaneously (much of which- like explosions, for example- wont be rendered at all due to either lack of resources or engine limitations).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

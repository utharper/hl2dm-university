	<div class="content">I've heard a few names bandied about recently, but I wanted to get some other admin/l33t peoples opinions on a good host.<br>
<br>
Our main server host just told us they weren't interested in fixing an issue with our server..and refunded our money, so we need to get hooked up fairly quickly.<br>
<br>
I would like to stick with a Windows host (duh), but I'd like to find one that allows me to install plug-ins with out having to submit a trouble ticket everytime (I coudn't upload/download move, rename or delete dll files...so).<br>
<br>
So, somebody with a TX datacenter would be best, as we are spread from FL to OR, who doesn't micro-manage the game servers so you can manage your own plugins.<br>
<br>
BTW..kleanservers.com may be inexpensive..but it seems they aren't interested in supporting hl2dm anymore...another host going CSS only.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">leetservers was my favorite - we used that for All of the War Room servers for about 2 years. They were ontop of everything.  Servers in NY and CHI so not the location you want but they ran very well.  Clanservers i had issues with as they tried to steal 70 bucks from me twice. By cancelling our server 5 days after we paid for the month saying we had a negitive balance when we didn't.  No complants against NuclearFallout as they had go prices and good service also.<br>
<br>
leet was the best by far gave us discounts on our private servers as well as pub, when they noticed the server ranking they gave us more discounts as it was #1 for a DM server. Sponsered a SOurce TV and enjoyed seeing our server run smoothly</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Leet servers are also a bit on the pricey side..at 3.99/slot<br>

FatPipes is definitely the front runner at this point, but I'm still looking for input.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Team Fusion runs NFO and they are good, but honestly I am not seeing a big difference for the money. Sometimes their servers still lag, even with my 15 ping and private server on Premium connection.<br>

I recommend Fatpipe to everyone lately. I have a few friends who run a central server of theirs and it is nice and clean, even at 50 ping.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">NFO runs stable, has solid hitreg (solid as it gets for this game, anyway) and great service, but they are also the most expensive option.<br>
<br>
Fatpipe i havent used but the servers that ive played on have been fine all round, and i hear the prices are reasonable too. Cant comment on their service.<br>
<br>
Gameservers... linux + bad hit reg is a losing combo, plus 90% of the players and teams who have used them have claimed their service is nonexistant. Great prices but youre likely to get what you pay for.<br>
<br>
If youre going to run 3+ servers or a huge number of slots, renting a whole box may be a better option in the long run.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

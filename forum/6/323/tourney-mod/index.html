Dro had a script that he had done that would make people spectate (with an added command in my plugin) until the next round.<br>

At one point somebody had asked  me to make a 1v1 plugin.  I still mean to do it at some point.  But not high on my priority list ATM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, stormie is more refined now.  Those blaster bolts are photoshopped in.  They couldn't get them to work.  Which is part of the reason they brought me in.  <br>
<br>
The ones I made look almost like those in the bottom picture.<br>
<br>
Myself and one other guy on the team are actually old enough to have seen all of them originally in the theaters when they came out.  Strange to be running around the deathstar, degobah, echo base shooting weapons and characters only found in the star wars movies.<br>
<br>
The modelers we have are damned incredible.  The artists too.  Heck, even the sound guy has put together some amazing things.  <br>
<br>
It's currently a blast to play in pre-alpha stage, i can't wait until we get it polished up!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

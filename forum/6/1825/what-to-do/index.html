	<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
Reading about all those server config files and going to the links that where posted (very good ones)let me tested my settings .<br>
I rent 3 servers and also i noticed that i was choking when server was full or sometimes when 10 people where on.<br>
Now i think i messed a couple things up  in my config or maybe with the commands cl_updaterate,cl_cmdrate,etc,.....<br>
Strange thing or better "good thing"is that nobody complaines so i think the fault is with me .I did a speedtest that i include .Someone knows what the recomended or the best settings i can adjust?<br>
Thanx in advance .Also thx to who did or try to help me with the "advanced tech. help".Sorry i had not much time but i really appreciate it .<br>
Also this forum what i read almost every day helped me a lot.<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">I noticed that you said it was choke causing the problem which is usually caused by the rate not being set high enough or a bad connection to the internet, I suppose it could also be your computers hardware causing bad lag in game maybe, once you start getting more people in a server more action is going to be going on, therefore your computers going to be pushed harder to keep up with those new events it has to render and process.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm most likely wrong about this because dm really doesn't take much of a machine to run.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well I must say that i have build a new pc from scratch with latest new things s,so its heavy enough for this game.Know i noticed that it is not with all the maps.But i download my maps from adviced websites,but the strange thing is that i have in my console many errors like "<br>
default error texture maps/dm_killbox_jump/cubemapdefault" and sometimes they end with "clamping" or something like that .Dont know what it means but i think i have to ask it on a mapper maybe.There are "except keepers and mani plugin"not any others installed but i m sure that thats not the problem because i did without and the problem stayed.1 thing i maybe forgot to say is that i'm connected with a router with 2 pc.Now i orderd a new extra fast line only for my pc so maybe that solves the problem?I let you know when so.Anyway thx for answering .<br>

K thx WT .So having a choke of 0-10isn't that bad after all?I must say that loss is almost always 0...or isn't that important?Choke sometimes max 50 but like i said depends on the map .Also it happen sometimes on wellknown maps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here are 2 made screenshots of in game .Server was empty so choke was 0 ,but look at the difference by "in" and its less in the more detailled map .Dont know if it has anything to do with it.Before i forgot to tell ;with a full server my choke isnt going higher then 50 but that is probably to much ?So best is to keep it between 0 - 10 ,like you said WT.I give it a try this evening when server is full. maybe i can set max people to 10 to give it try if that makes any difference?Als i made screenshot during a progress like a nade exploding or a barrel but that was no problem in the net_graph thing.<br>
Thx anyway</div>

Out means cmdrate, that's what you are ACTUALLY uploading to the server.<br>
In means updaterate, that's what you are ACTUALLY downloading from the server.<br>
<br>
Please note that you NEVER can upload more than your actually framerate (see your second screenshot?), and you never be able to download more than the actual server framerate - which is not a problem for us because we don't have 100tick servers in consecuence of malprops (fps on a dedicated server by default: 64).<br>
<br>
K man, hope this clear out few things for you.<br>

Really thx to the respons .I give all teh available options a shot.Now my internet is turbonet(thats how they call it here in belgium)and is specially for games .When i play crysis i dont have it (played it once -&gt;too addicted to hl2dm).But anyway i try the given advice settings and let you know.Yesterday i changed my graphic card settings ---so i enabled colorcorrection and i have to say it improved a lot even with choke .Maybe sounds this strange but its true.Not 100% but its good playable.K ty for advice i let you know what it did.I shall post a screenshot before and after.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Well i y tried these settings sv_maxrate 100000<br>
                                      cl_updaterate 66<br>
                                      cl_cmdrate 66<br>
and they work fine for me only the first 30 sec  i join the server its strange and especially with the first triggerd sound but after  that no problems ,so ty you very much all.<br>
I have 2 more questions about the servers.<br>
1) Sometimes i run a map and i get this in my console(see picture).So i then decide to take a look to the server with HLSW<br>
  tool and everything looks fine and sometimes people are playing,but i have to stop because its too lagging .Is this a fault <br>
  in the map or a fault at my computer and can it be fixed?<br>
2)I read somewhere on the forum here that its important to clean up your download map of the server every week but what exactly does it mean?Do i have to delete somme files or....?<br>
Ty very much to helping me out with the question before and this .<br>

<br>
1gb RAM<br>
ATI X1900 XT<br>
AMD 64 X2 Dual Core<br>
Soundblaster X-Fi<br>
<br>
never had any trouble until now.<br>

Problem: When i start HL2, as soon as i hit the refresh server list, i get insane lag for a good 20 seconds.<br>
<br>
*picking a server up*<br>
<br>
Once the map has been loaded, i get a sound loop and a 10 second hardcore lag.<br>
<br>
Ping never goes past 30-40 and my fps are above 100 all the time according to net_graph 3. I really don't know wth is going on since ping / fps are fine but everything is freaking out.<br>
<br>
Also, if i close HL2, and i re-launch it, it won't do it again.<br>
<br>
I do not run any firewall when i play.<br>
<br>
I do not have any viruses/spyware 100% as i have separate drives, one strickly for gaming/work with restricted internet access.<br>
<br>
I can barely record as it slows my game down , still no FPS / ping/ choke issue according to net_graph.<br>
<br>
Any idea? this look compeltely fucked to me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also check your video options and make sure it is all normal. I has a typo in my autoexec and it was setting everything to full. This caused me to take 5x longer to get into a server and then "drown" for 30 seconds when I finally did, then lag like I had 10FPS in game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That might be it, when i installed my CPU i could've used some additional thermal paste, and i wanted to add some more.<br>

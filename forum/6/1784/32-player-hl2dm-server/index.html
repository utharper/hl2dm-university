	<div class="content">Hey guys and gals, I'd like to see if anyone out there can help me. I rented a 32 player server for hl2dm, but the server provider says I have to install a mod for that myself. Do any of you know what mod should be used to allow 32 players on a server? Any help would be great. Thanks, kbaxter1</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

"We apologize for any confusion regarding the size of your Half Life 2: Death Match game server. As you might have noticed on the order page it is posted that the base HL2:DM game supports up to 16 players but with modifications the game does indeed support up to 32 players; as we do not provide managed services at these prices all modifications are up to the customer. We do value your business and as a one-time courtesy we have made the necessary changes to bring you up to 32 player slots. Please note that as Half Life 2: DM was designed for a maximum of 16 players that the stability of the game may be adversely effected with running more than 16 players."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Worth a shot? No it isn't. This game is 4 years old. It is a fact a server so large is unplayable. It has been tried. The game only supports 12-16 at most. Do what you want. We don't tell you this to rain on your parade. It is technologically a fail. It is a fact.<br>
<br>
Why do you WANT 32 folks on a server?<br>
What will you do with that many?<br>
<br>
Who would want that many ***holoes on their server.<br>
Do you even have that many?<br>
COOP maps work because there's nothing happening on them. NPCs? Who cares?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

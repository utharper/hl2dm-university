	<div class="content">I know we had trouble trying to get mani running.  It was the newest version, and I wasnt involved.  I hear there is a problem with that not working?  Any thoughts?  We have had lots of problems with our server with crashes on map-changes, severe lag spikes on config execution, and a lack of RCON capability.  Hoping Mani can at least fix that last one.<br>

The problem with all of the pugins out there save one that I know of, they are written for CS:S.  They aren't really playtested on HL2DM.  Since the CS:S engine is based on the HL2DM engine, they assume everything is going to work until they get bug reports back.  <br>
<br>
People have been twisting my arm out there in the servers to get my plugin to be an admin pugin as well.  I think I'm going to cave in and do it.  Might make servers easier to manage with one plugin.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, the plugins out there are great and add much to the game, none of them are really written FOR HL2DM.  That's my mission.<br>

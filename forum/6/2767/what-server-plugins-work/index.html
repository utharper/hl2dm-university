	<div class="content">Sorry for making all these posts lately. Been awhile since I've gotten into Hl2. I was starting a server soon, and was looking into running a few plug-ins. I like to keep it at a minimum though, so don't expect blood splatters, ads every 5 seconds, or a hook mod!<br>
<br>
Is mani-admin-plugin still working? I try to visit their site, but the link from google is dead (temporarily unavailable?). I just wanted basic functions for a votemap, a basic swear filter (for those particularly nasty remarks), and maybe a basic stats deal.<br>
<br>
I've seen a few servers running hit sounds. That's awesome. Where can I get the good version of that plug-in? I won't have to rely on false positives when I see blood go flying! Also, I'm debating about a basic spawn protection. Something like what UT3 used, where you are protected for about 2 seconds from when you initially spawn. <br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

But for the other things, I would check out sourcemod.net and see if you can find anything there.<br>

I am planning on a mani replacement for HL2DM only in the near future.  Sorry I can't be more help right now <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I found the 2.06 plugin which is exactly what I was looking for for the hit sounds. Does the 2.06 also keep track of stats?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, Im looking for a link to the impulse item spawn deal. Did VALVe fix that? Or is it necessary to use a 3rd party fix?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Awesome! Thanks for the info.<br>
<br>
I successfully tracked down the good versions.<br>
<br>
My only concern now is the impulse-item-spawn exploit. Was playing on the SocalServers and found health and armor spawning in the most random of places. I've read of a 3rd party fix, I'll have to try and track that down.<br>
<br>
I suppose its nothing good admining can't take care of, would be nice to 'nip it in the butt before it starts though!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah I'm actually debating this at the moment.<br>
<br>
Quake 3/Live has a form of spawn protection. You start off with 120 life when you spawn, and it slowly ticks down to 100 (everything above 100 always ticks down). This makes it so you can't be spawn raped by a single shot. In Quake Live rail damage is even reduced to 90 to cut back more on insta-spawn rape.<br>
<br>
UT3 has a 3 second spawn protection. You take no damage whatsoever for the 3 seconds, and you glow like a mofo.<br>
<br>
HL2dm is the only one that doesn't offer anything, but its also the only one you spawn in with insta-kill weapons too, atleast outside of the Impact Hammer in UT3.<br>
<br>
I wasn't thinking of anything drastic like what [FF] has, where you are constantly protected until you move, and people take 10 points of damage if they attack you anyway. Thats too easily abused, as I've seen players use spawn protected people as shields, while the attacker loses health as his shots hit the protected player instead.<br>
<br>
If anything it would be a 2 second spawn protection from damage only. No other rules. However, I've never been a fan of spawn protection so I'm not 100% sold yet.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I prefer to think of it as using your environment you to your advantage. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">People will find anyway possible to win in the system you present them with. I have never found spawn protection to be useful, though the best system I have seen does seem to be the health countdown. Not sure where it started but I never saw it in any q3 servers I played but it was in jk2.  Unfortunately it wont save you in hl2 from a rocket or a physobject or shotgun or well nearly anything but a crossbow.  <br>
<br>
The only thing I know for sure spawn protection does is shelter noobs from how the game plays in leagues or competition and makes them more afraid of it. Makes it harder for them to get into it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

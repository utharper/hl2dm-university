<br>
<em class="text-italics">Summary:<br>
Steam is a content delivery and management tool from Valve Software.  Steam has a rate throttle (Steam Rate) that needs to be set to your typical internet download speed setting.  <br>
<br>
Steam based games also have a rate setting that is not the same as the Steam Rate (but similar in intent).   <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, it turns out that changing your rate in the game will also cause the Steam Rate setting to be changed which can cause a variety of symptoms.<br>
<br>
Each game has it's own rate setting and Steam has it's own, but for some bizarre reason Valve chose to programmatically link the game rate back to the Steam rate, so if you set your in-game "rate" to some high number, say 20000 or 30000 (30000 is equivalent to 10MBit download rates) then this also will change the Steam download rate to the same number.<br>
<br>
You can see the Steam Rate settings in the Steam settings:<br>
        steam &gt; settings &gt; downloads &gt; speed of your internet<br>
<br>
The game rate behaves very differently from the Steam Rate,  I find I need 20000 or 30000 in source games to minimize choke but then my Steam Server Browser gets all messed up and I do see some "extreme" symptoms (the reason I started working on this little application).<br>
<br>
Servers can also slow-hack your rate settings and cause this.<br>
<br>
This is mostly a problem when you have a slower DSL or cable connection, 512 or 768, but getting it set to 10Mbit is likely to mess up almost anyone somewhat unless you have a fiber optic connection.<br>
<br>
The Rate change doesn't actually affect Steam right away, Steam becomes affected the next time it restarts.</em></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yea. god only knows why Valve chose to give Steam (the app) a different rate settings than the actually game it playing (DM). but there you go.<br>
good thing is with this little app i can reduce to almost none existant DM crashes.<br>

You're actually incorrect, this program locks your steam rate, so you can change your ingame rate without it changing the steam rate, the whole problem was that the ingame rate were linked with the steam rate, so now you can change the steam connection setting(the download setting), then this program will lock it there, then you can change your ingame rate and it wont change your steam rate. You can test this by changing your steam rate in the download setting to your closest connection, when i change it to 756k, and i go ingame i see my rate has been changed to 9999, when i change my rate back to 20000 and i go to the steam download setting, the setting has magically changed to 2M/LAN, which is way higher than my connection.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

MS won't  update XP to DX10 not becasue XP is dead and vista is awsome but because why would anyone upgrade to vista if XP does what vista does?<br>

The default heapsize varies, but can be 256MB or less. If you have 2GB of RAM you may wish to increase this to 512MB (a heapsize of 524288). You can use higher values if you wish, but I don't recommend exceeding half your physical RAM (e.g. for 2GB RAM, don't set heapsize higher than 1024000). You can't force the game to load completely into RAM, that's not what this command does.</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

it's a small app that sets Steam's rate different than your Games'. so your games don't crash as a result of a conflict between the two. this is a known steam crash bug. that's all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

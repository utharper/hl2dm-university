	<div class="content">Okay, so I just recently found out that a lot of people were unable to connect to my servers because I was inadvertently disallowing the "high res" content packs because of these whitelist rules:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>	materials\models\props_foliage\...   allow_from_disk+check_crc
	models\props_foliage\...             allow_from_disk+check_crc</code></pre></div>

I thought that would work because if it fails, the server would allow them in, just force the client to load the stock content instead.  I probably need to set sv_pure_kick_clients to 0 for that to happen?  If not, how do I get that behavior?<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
That said, who runs a server that allows "high res" model packs but still has sv_pure, and how did you setup the whitelist?  I assume that just removing the "+check_crc" would do the trick, but wouldn't that open up a lot of cheats?<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">We run an sv_pure 1 but we don't allow custom models from players so I can't help you there.  We have found that client based custom models tend to mess with the server more than they are worth.<br>

There is a clan called Older Than DOS on the west coast of the U.S.  Their leader named Cuz is a server guru but he doesn't frequent this site.  He has some instructions on is website on how to do various things.  They do use custom models on their server but I think its server side.  I don't have the link to their website but I am sure you can find them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The solution is, <strong class="text-strong">instead of</strong> trying to connect to it either through the console command or the friends tab of server list, you need to<br>

	<div class="content">this is more than likely not your issue, its his.  let me ask you this, did your friend just recently get a router?  YOU dont need to port forward anything, but if you friend is hosting locally HE needs to do that.  you are seeing the server, you just cant access it.  if i had to guess your friend is hosting a lan server and does not have his set up correct for external access. and all you are getting to is his router and then getting blocked. there is some more info you need to post like, where is his server being hosted?  you also asked about lan and wan.  simply this means local area network and wide area network, im not going to explain what that means cause you can just google it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Is your friend making the server through the dedicated server tool, or in game, or is it a purchased server?<br>
<br>
•If he's using the dedicated server tool, it's likely (almost definitely) a problem with router ports.<br>
•If he's making it in game, make sure he types <strong class="text-strong">sv_lan 0</strong> in console, then <strong class="text-strong">heartbeat</strong>, and wait a couple minutes after he hosts it, then it should be in the master games list.  You'll have to connect from there or it will say "not responding"<br>
•If he bought it, tell him to bitch at the provider and/or get his money back.<br>
<br>
Failing that, check your firewall settings.  Or turn it off entirely, if it's just windows firewall.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
well, for him to be able to see servers and join them and not one server would require him to use some advanced firewall settings.  since he said he doesnt know much about that i doubt thats it.  possibly did your friend ban you from the server. perhaps its a setting he has in his ban config file that is blocking your access.  do you have another steam account with hl2 that you could try to connect to it with?  and possibly he banned you by ip address.  if he is using something like mani and banned you joking around but did it permently instead of temp.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have often wondered about doing a mod for HL2 that would incorporate a lot of plugin functionality, but being 100% stable (well as stable as the engine will let us be).  Also fixing some of the bugs that bother us so much.<br>
<br>
Of course, we can't cure the engine woes, that's unavailable.<br>
<br>
I'm up for working on it if people will actually try it and support it.<br>
<br>
I'd rather do that than the plugin because it will be easier, faster, and more stable.<br>

	<div class="content">I'll start looking into it.  I just wish it was as easy to load mods on HL2 as it was on the quake series.  You connect to a server that is modded, it would use that DLL.<br>
<br>
But valve never did care about 3rd parties <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
What other uses other than admin plugin / scoreboard / timers / match modes / fixable bug fixes should I look at?<br>
<br>
Not to mention that valve's updates wouldn't effect the mod like they do plugins.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Maybe the option of a hitsound. I like the way that they have an optional hit-sound in HL2 CTF and HL2 Pro mods. Personally, I liked it and would like to see it in another mod.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

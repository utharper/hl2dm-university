I never used anything but a logitech for the past 10 years, had many 500, 518 and g5's. The logitech's always wore out on me and I never could get just the right feel out of the mouse with sensitivity adjustments. About 2 years ago before I got my last g5 I tried a razer copperhead  and I hated it. Thought razers were crap but after finding myself playing better with lower sensitivities and seeing a really nice test of all mice with low sensitivity where the death adder was by far the best scoring mouse in the test, I decided to give razer another shot. <br>
All I can say is I love this mouse, everything about it and I notice my crosshair is more steady than ever no jitter what so ever, would never go back to logitech. I got about 6-8 months on this mouse now I believe and no signs of wear or problems yet. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've used an MX518 and a G9 in the last few years.  The MX518 was a great mouse, but when I built this rig last year I grabbed a G9 to go with it.  The 1st one died a few weeks after I bought it, took it back and got another.<br>
<br>
Cons: <br>
1st one broke.  Not sure why, but might have been one night when I was goofing around and dropped it, so durability might be a little on the low side.  I've been alot more careful with the latest one though and it's lasted over a year now.<br>
High DPI can be bad.  I found this out the hard way in a scrim.  Move too fast and the mouse will lose tracking and give you a stuttered movement.  I flipped to the other side of eXactMat, made a few adjustments and it seems to be fine now.<br>
The wheel tilt is useless in a game where you use the scroll for anything unless you like having actions take place unintentionally.  For example, I use wheel down to jump, wheel up for my shotgun.  I tried binding other weapons to the wheel tilt, but when jumping or switching to shotty, anything bound to tilt will constantly be inadvertently used.<br>
The thumb buttons are a little too close together.  I had to switch to using only one them because I was constantly hitting both at the same time.  I'd like to see Logitech or Razer make a mouse with thumb buttons set in an over/under configuration like the Microsoft Sidewinder.<br>
If you hold the mouse kinda flat fingered you'll end up hitting the DPI switching buttons when using the left click.<br>
<br>
Pros:  <br>
I have small fingers despite being a pretty big guy.  The G9 fits my hand pretty well.  <br>
I use the Setpoint software with it, which is nice for setting up different profiles for different games and apps.  <br>
The wheel tilt is handy for things like volume control or scrolling sideways.<br>
The weights are nice, I like a bit heavier mouse.<br>
The LED's on the mouse let you know what profile you are using and you can change the colors to what you want.<br>
Comes with 2 grips so you can pick the one that feels more comfortable.<br>
If the pads wear out you can easily order another set from Logitech for a few bucks.<br>
There are two magnets that come with the box that hold the lid closed.  These are super powerful magnets.  I have 4 of them now in a stack on my refrigerator.  My daughter walked by about 2 weeks ago and got a little too close and it pulled her ear ring out of her ear.  She's k, didn't tear anything, just pulled it out.  Be careful with those, lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i had a DA that lasted one year.  when it worked properly, i loved it.  in fact, i'd say that its still the most comfortable mouse i've ever owned.  i did think the software was a pain in the ass.  it seemed to have a mind of its own and need fine tuning every so often.  maybe thats no longer an issue... but at the time, i think they went through 2 software upgrades and one firmware upgrade in the year i owned it.  i chose not to get another DA because my serious, unfixable, issues began around the 9 month mark of ownership.  customer support strung me along with "try this" "try that" fixes which never completely corrected the issues.  when i finally gave up and asked for warranty replacement... they said no, because i allowed them to string me along until 12 months 5 days.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
<br>
my initial replacement was a G5.  i went through 3 of those in 3 months.  im convinced each time it was a cord issue where the cord enters the nose of the mouse.  i have limited space and the cord would aquire a permanent "bend" right at the nose then slowly die in game.  all 3, exact same death.<br>
<br>
i went backwards in tech and got a mx518.  i'm very happy with it.  not as comfy as the DA, but not nearly as complicated.  so far, its been very reliable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've used a couple G5s and a G9.  I like the G9 more because my hand sits on it better and its scrollwheel is superior by far.  I don't use wheel tilt for anything, so that's not an issue for me.<br>
<br>
The whole reason I used multiple G5s is because I hoped to find one with a scrollwheel that didn't skip or duplicate scroll "steps" and also didn't scroll accidentally when middle-clicked.  No go on that.  The G5 scrollwheel is just awful.  Not even my $5 no-name laptop mouse has those problems.  If you don't use the scroll wheel or middle-click in-game, it won't affect you tho.<br>
<br>
Will probably look at Razer for my next one though, because of the G9's deceleration at high sensitivities.  Fast and normal mouse movements seem to be 1:1...  not the case for especially slow movements.  (This is with the DPI up and in-game sensitivity down.  really slow mouse movements correspond to even smaller movements in-game.)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You really shouldnt generalize the razers of today with the ones of yesterday. If you are basing your comments on your old copperhead, I will agree I hated the copperhead. But the deathadder is a completely different game (as you say) it's likely the best mouse I have ever used. I flat out destroyed 3 mx 518's 2 G5's with my larger stronger hands and did get some CTS problems with the logitechs. My deathadder is going on 6 months old now and its still as awesome as the day I got it.<br>
<br>
Twitchy is absolutely not a word I would use to describe it at all, it's very steady and my mag has gotten 10x better using it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

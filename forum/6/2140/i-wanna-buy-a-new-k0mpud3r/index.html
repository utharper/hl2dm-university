	<div class="content">I'm thinking about getting a new k0mpud3r. The one that I have is really really old.<br>
<br>
Well, right now I have:<br>
<br>
AMD Athlon XP 1800+ 1.53 GHz<br>
768 MB of RAM<br>
110 GB Hard Drive<br>
Nvidia GeForce FX 5500<br>
DVDRW IDE1004<br>
Lite On DVD Rom<br>
Lite On LTR<br>
<br>
Anyways, I got this PC for free from a friend of my fathers. After I buy my new PC, the one that I own currently will turn into a internet browsing computer. The one I buy will be primarily for gaming. They both will be in my room hooked up to the internet. I don't know whether I lag in games because of my computer, which I think is the case, or whether it's my internet connection or something else.<br>
<br>
Here's the download speed - <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/result/300516892.png" class="postlink">http://www.speedtest.net/result/300516892.png</a><br>
<br>
I've been saving all summer for a new PC. I want to build my own PC, but I'm finding already built ones that I like for pretty cheap. I don't need a graphics card because my parents will buy me one. I'll just need a mobo that can support it.<br>
<br>
Two pre built PC's have caught my eye.<br>
<a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage....prd93700050005" class="postlink">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage....prd93700050005</a><br>
<a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage....prd93300050015" class="postlink">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage....prd93300050015</a><br>
<br>
I don't know much about computers, honestly. I know I can build one though with my dad's helped so if that'd be cheaper I just might as well do that.<br>
<br>
What i'm going to need out of a new PC.<br>
<br>
4 GB RAM<br>
Good CPU<br>
Good PSU<br>
Graphics card around $250<br>
An LCD monitor. Hopefully 19 inch.<br>
Keyboard and mouse. Cheapest as possible. I'm hoping to spend under 10 here. (If that's possible)<br>
I don't think I need more than 500 GB. I still haven't used up all 110 GBs.<br>
I'd prefer XP over Vista. That's what I don't like about the pre-builts.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
 I also have a single core 3500+ and used to have an nvidia fx5200 paired with it, well now I got a new video card with 512mb vram and all that fancy, it did make it better but the cpu still holds it back a lot I can tell.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">BI if you want a smoother running game and the best FPS you can you CARE about graphics and graphics cards.  Also the better your graphics set up is the better you can snipe people from long distance.   You also want a fast processor.  You are looking to improve your gaming with an improved machine.<br>
<br>
emachines SUCK!<br>
<br>
There is a reason the Dell is so cheap.<br>
It has integrated Graphic = SUCKS for gaming<br>
The processor is a 2.53 Dual core (not bad) but only has 3 mb cashe when most have 4 but that in itself may not be too bad.<br>
If you could get the same machine with a 512 mb vid card it would be better and yes it would be a vast improvement over what you already have.<br>

All I am saying is that the machines you posted will not be able to hold you over within a year. Meaning, they are overpriced and not something any gamer would really want. They are not built for updating either. With a little effort, you could get a very good machine, within your price range, that would make the 2 you posted look silly. You should look for highend parts that are very upgradable and on sale.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If your going to build a system for 700.00 thats probably about what you could get, if it were me I would save just a few more dollars and hold out another month or more to try to get a better motherboard, and power supply. Generally the ones that come in cases are pretty cheap and can be had for 10.00 if bought separately. Cheap power supplies can cause crashing and other issues so I budget at least 40-50 for one that is decent in the 450-550 watt range. The ram should be fine, the processor is fine, the HDD is fine, the OS is fine, as far as a monitor goes, you didnt say if it was wide screen, I would get a WS for sure, an I have seen 19" WS with 2 ms response times for the same price you posted so find a better one there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">here's what you need to know.  your motherboard is everything, everything.  DO NOT chince on the mobo.  the cpu your talking about is not going to be worth shit if you buy a shitty mobo.  buy either an ASUS or nForce. the 750i nForce is nice, the p5n-d or p5n-e are nice from ASUS.  they are all about $160, you need to spend that tho.  you want something with sli incase you want dual(or more) GPU's in the future.  also, you DO need a high power PSU, if your running quad core cpu that alone is going to take up a lot of power, never mind alll the power new gpu's take up.  for RAM, i HIGHLY recomend CRUCIAL. it's the best RAM you can buy, life time warentee.  dont spend all your money on 4 gigs of crap ram, spend it on 2 gigs of quality ram.  windows 32 xp can't utilize 4 gigs of ram anyway, wont even reconize it.(native anyway). other than that, make sure you get a case that is WAY bigger then what you need. 2 reasons 1) airflow 2) room to build later.  for a gpu, i always went with ATI but their marketing has fallen short, meaning a lot of games are being built for nVidea, which is why you see their ads at the beginning.  nVidea throws big gaming comps money and their driver specs, in turn the gaming companies write their games to run better with nVidea.  i have two similar gpu's one is from ati and the other from nVidea.  UT3 crashes every 5 mins on the ATI card, works fine with the nVdiea.  now, if this is your first build, hit me up on steam, ill help you out, i've built prolly 10 + machines. its also important to make sure everything in your machine is running at the same bus speeds. a lot of ppl make that mistake.  good luck man</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm running vista and haven't had issues with drivers, now thats a miricale for one.<br>
<br>
The heat and sound issues are true, heat can be dealt with by making the fan run at a manual percentage such as 60 percent in game, it is loud, but when playing a game like hl2dm you have headphones canceling out outside sound, and when your not in game you can change the fan speed down.<br>

Yes, I know you gave me advice. I am not worried about SLI because I don't plan to buy another video card. About the airflow, I'll have around 6 fans I believe(?) so I'm not too worried. I don't think I'll be building much later as I won't have a job again until next summer. Now, I did do some of my research. Windows XP can use all four gigs of RAM. You just have to change some things. I read this directly from the windows site. I'm getting a pay check sometime next week so I will have money for another PSU. <br>
<br>
Edge - I bought the card that I did because someone said I should buy a 512 MB card. I thought 512 &lt; 640 so I said I'll go with that one. Lol that was pretty much what I based my decision off of. Plus, i didn't have enough for a 9 series. My parents said the limit was 160. D;<br>
<br>
Overall, this was a new experience for me. I've never done something like this and I'm looking forward to doing it again sometime in the future. Unfortunately, my other computers graphics card went out. I'm looking to buy a 7 series. I want lowest of the line just because that's how my old one was. The old computer that i've had will be used for friend's that come over that want to play and internet surfing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This.<br>
<br>
badinf, if you must go with a cheap PSU, consider getting one rated at twice what you intend on using.  Cheap PSUs can start flaking out around 75 to 80% of their rated wattage, and when it happens, they're particularly sinister to diagnose because it often looks like a problem from some other component in your system.<br>

I've used Enermax and Antec.  From experience, Antec honored their 3-year warranty on a 2.75-year old PSU that gradually faded on me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
i have the 1650 pro, used it in an older machine.  I liked it, i think you would be happy with that card.  IMO well worth $50<br>
<br>
i would also take that usb hub out of there, that mobo looks like it prolly has 2 or 3 slots available on board.  i doubt you are using more than that.  <br>
<br>
move that sound card(im guessing thats what's in the PCI slot) down to the last slot and invest in a $10 exaust fan, seat it under the video card. it will suck the heat from the video card fan and blow it out of the case.<br>

it looks like you have 2 cd/dvd rom drives in there....why?  unless you are doing a lot of dvd/cd copying not sure why you would have 2.  even then im not sure why you have 2. you're just drawing unneed power from your PSU.  take one out. and put the HD and the dvd drive on the same IDE(master and slave them) not only will this help with power usage but will help with airflow as well.<br>

i see 3 sticks of RAM, they must be 1/4 gig each. you might wanna think about replacing 2 of the 256's with 2 512's.  under a gig of RAM with XP is rough.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ok, here's an issue i have never encountered in all my time working on PC's.  i recently installed the GTX460. i manually removed the drivers for my old card, went in safe mode used driver sweeper to get rid of the drivers windows leaves behind, ran a defrag, installed the new drivers and everything is good.  here's the issue, on start up, (not every time, but atleast 50% of the time) the drivers have unistalled themselves leaving me with a fucked up screen with windows trying to use the card with no instuctions.  i have to reinstall the drivers.  anybody have experience with this b4?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

in theory that would work but restoring to a point would take longer than reinstalling the drivers.  ill have to log a ticket with their support</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, but i have never had a virus, malware, or any slowdowns, registry problems...with my geek config.<br>
Since i don't have a network, i turn everything off. And System Restore and Indexing Service are huge hits on the GUI.<br>
Plus, the shit has never worked and will not work if you get a virus.<br>
Viruses use IE and System Restore to reconstitute themselves.<br>
Get a real worm and try to restore!<br>
<br>
I learned a lot of securing up and speeding up from Black Vipers site and other places.<br>
I don't have problems but driver issues and there, i don't sweat it. I just get an older driver and load it up, no problem.<br>
There were some NVidia driver issues recently having to do with Desktop Manager.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">need some advice.  first off, i'll tell you that i have been having some phone line issues... which at&amp;t has maybe fixed (water around the junction box at the side of the house im guessing since the tech dropped a big tube of silicon in the garden he stomped his way through).  the symptom was not being able to recieve phone calls but i could still make phone calls.<br>
<br>
during this same timeframe, i've been crashing a lot more than usual.  not the typical "memory can not be read" type of crash.  this is a red lettered warning "connection problem".  the screen freezes, sometimes i can still hear all the sounds as other players keep playing while im frozen, other times i get no sound at all.  then i either crash (after what seems to be a looooong time frozen) or i return to play after a loooong pause and the weapon in my hands is invisible and my rebel model jingles like a combine.  so, i keep playing like that until i really crash, or i leave the server and rejoin with everything working normal.<br>
<br>
last night when i had this crash during draft, i would lose the connection to vent at the same time.  and although the hl2dm crash was long in duration, the vent connection auto rejoined within seconds.<br>
<br>
so.... is my dsl fooked?  my pings remain fine and i see no choke or loss before this happens.  its like my connection suddenly disconnects.  but i dont think its for more than a few seconds.  which hl2dm doesnt appear to like.  any apps out there that i can use to monitor this situation?  something that will tell me about disconnection rather than slowdowns in upload/download?  all suggestions welcome.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yep sounds like a connection issue with your ISP.  Could be some moisture still in the box or somewhere else down the line?  I've had this happen before with a junction box down the street.  Once they got it dried out it was fine.  <br>
<br>
It is not a problem with your computer itself.  You get the same sort of message when a server crashes and you lose connection to it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ya, i've seen that red connection error b4, most of the time it happens when the server crashes and everybody loses their connections.  if it's just you that it happens to in a DM then its deffinetly your internet or your NIC.  could just be a hiccup in your connection which would disrupt your packet stream. you also most likely wouldnt see a jump in your ping or choke before it happens.  you would be fine until the hiccup reached you.  think of it like throwing a stone into smooth lake or pond.  the water outside the ripple is totally fine and undisurbed until the ripple gets to it. i highly reccomend getting cable if you have the money and/or reporting these accorances to your ISP, see if others have reported the same issues in your area.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well last night it was definately just me.  i was getting raped on aim by herb, and el prez and a couple others.  got the connection warning crash 3 times in one map.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">  <br>
<br>
none of them were effected.<br>
<br>
at&amp;t has always had me over the barrel.  charter cable didnt service my area... they literally stopped 10 houses down the street.  grrrr.  but maybe charter has expanded, i havent checked for a few months.  but now that they've declared backruptcy, i'm not even sure i should check.<br>
<br>
i did call at&amp;t.  we had our usual discussion regarding the paid plan speed "up to 3 Mbps" (i get 1.5 max) being within acceptable parameters (fuckers!).  then we discussed my connection problems.  kinda went like this:<br>
<br>
me:  i seem to be getting disconnected for a second or 2 while playing online games<br>
tech:  did you check the lights on the modem?<br>
me:  the disconnect is pretty fast.  when i look, the lights all ok.<br>
tech: so the lights are ok?<br>
me: its like a second or 2 i think<br>
tech:  we've checked your modem and you seem to be connected now<br>
me:  its a very brief disconnect and its intermittent.<br>
tech:  did you check the modem lights?<br>
me:  last night it happened 6 times in 2 hours<br>
tech:  the lights were ok?<br>
me:  when i looked, yes...<br>
tech:  your modem is working fine now?<br>
me:  its a brief issue...<br>
tech:  check the lights.<br>
tech:  if the lights arent all on, call us back<br>

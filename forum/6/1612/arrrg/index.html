	<div class="content">After using mx518's and G5's for so long, all other mice just feel like shit in my hands, cant get used to them.<br>
I've had several problems with them but its bound to happen when you use them hard like we do. Most of my problems have been the mouse 1 and 2 buttons failing and once I had a mouse die completely, however I think that was from slamming it down out of frustration when I first started playing hl2dm and was getting owned hard.<br>
I would call logitech they will send you a replacement, it just takes a few weeks and you don't have to submit anything. Just call and give the numbers off the bottom. I pretty much think at this point if you can get 6 months of hard use out of a logitech mouse your doing good.<br>
Lastly I have also seen problems with USB ports so in case you haven't tried it yet, switch ports.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have a copperhead, and I always loved it, but it seems to be crappy compered to many others =/, that's why I'd wait till someone made a good review about the new Razer Lachesis mouse, cuz really you can't just trust on people's experience.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I keep having this problem on and off, sometimes it's really bad - sometimes it's gone for weeks. So what is it? Well, my controls, both mouse and kayboard, freezes for a second or two. The last input is repeated without me being able to do anything about it. This mostly results in me going at a constant speed in a diagonal across the floor, sometimes with MOUSE1 active. And once in a while it happens when I'm cooking a nade which leaves me with it exploding in my face... Anyone seen this and have a possible solution to it? I tested heat related and cleaned up my comp, but still the same.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Do you by chance have a gamepad or a joystick plugged in? I found that problem was being caused by input from a joystick I had plugged in and it did exactly that caused my xhair to take off on a diagonal. I also had it happen sometime later from a gamepad. So now I only plug those in when Im actually going to play a game I use them in and problem was solved. Other than that I have had USB ports simply stop responding and a reboot usually fixed that and or switching ports. That dam joystick thing was a real bugger to figure out though, since it was just sitting there on my desk in a corner not being touched.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I only have my mouse (MX518), kayboard (Logitech ultra-flat) and a headset which is plugged in so it can draw power from the USB. Maybe it could be that the headset is overloading somehow? I'll see if I can a plug it in to another USB hub. Problem is, sometimes I can for weeks without much of a problem, then it can suddenly comes on every 10 sec.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

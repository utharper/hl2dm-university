The WD Caviar Black 640GB has a bigger platter and is faster than the 500GB version. If you're on a budget I'd recommend going for that rather than the Velociraptor.<br>
For a quad CPU you could probably do well with the P5Q-E mobo based on the P45 chipset. Also, what RAM are you planning on?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im going for Corsair 4GB Kit (2x2GB) DDR2 800MHz/PC2-6400 XMS2 Memory Non-ECC Unbuffered <br>
I should get all 4Gb out with the motherboard and 64bit OS<br>
<br>
I have not considered that other parts for the CPU yet but im not overclocking it so I won't have to worry about cooling since the case should provide plenty of that.<br>

It doesn't offer 'space' It offers a larger viewing area at the same res, so you'll be able to fit the same amount of 'work' on both of the monitors. On the 22" it will look bigger as the pixels are bigger, but on the 20" it will look smoother, crisper and clearer as the pixels are smaller. <br>

If it's 'space' you're after then the next monitor/res up from 20/22/1680x1050 would be 24 @ 1920x1200 which is obviously going to cost more and possibly have a slower response time. And with cost in mind you'd might as well buy 2x 20" wide screens giving you 3360x1050  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yea i see on the 22 and 20 benfit of 22" is that i can sit well away back from the monitor to enjoy same viewing feild as i would get with a 20 if was closer. Its nothing that I would really notice really and would preffer to have that extra 2" to enjoy my films on. <br>
<br>
I remember a while back there was a 22" Samsung SyncMaster 226CW which was going around for £180 or so that had a 2ms with a lovely gloss black finish with silver lines and a blue led button. Its better than there new model which has that swivel adjestment base that i don't like that much and it chunky design.  <br>
<br>
Right now no one is selling other than by sellers that charge too much and the ones that you get decent price no longer run that screen. I think after Jan I may just see it reapear since they must of sold them and are out of stock plus prices usually drop by then.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i think it looks pretty solid snd.  there are some other good suggestions in this thread as well.  although i'm fond of the intel core 2 duo for gaming, i know you work pretty extensively with graphics.  so i think the quad is a good compromise for you, especially with vista... if you feel you must have vista.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
but i'll give the same advice about the stock intel heatsink/fan.  i generally think it's junk.  you have a good airflow case, but monitor your temps initially and be prepared to install a better quality hsf in the future.  for sure, wipe the factory thermal grease off your cpu chip and use a quality thermal grease instead.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

the psu is unnecessarily powerful for a single card pc. get a corsair vx450w instead.<br>
<br>
also, green power winchesters are to be avoided. get a standard hdd with no fancy environmentally friendly seal of approval BS. <br>
<br>
the rest is fine, although keep in mind hl2dm doesnt utilize more than 1 cpu core so a single core (even its a core 2 one) running at 2.33 ghz  will not give you KICK-ASS fps. just saying in case youre one of those few people who get anxious when their fps drops below 100 (like me). the option is always there to overclock the cpu, even without buying a better cooler or raising the voltage. <br>
<br>
whats good about having 4 cpu cores in everyday use is that youll be able to watch full hd videos (1080p) without a problem. (just an example)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its junk for building a new system. <a href="http://www.hardocp.com" class="postlink">www.hardocp.com</a> shows a fair comparison of clock for clock against a few CPU's. The architecture on it just wasn't that good.<br>
<br>
Basically the Phenom II OC's ok, but the QXXX OC'd to 3.2 ghz and a Phenom II oc'd to 3.2 ghz the QXXX wins.<br>
<br>
If just upgrading its not bad though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

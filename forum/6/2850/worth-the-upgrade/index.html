	<div class="content">I feel my current setup is getting rather sluggish it is almost 3 years old well the RAM and CPU are.<br>
<br>
AMD X2 4800 skt 939 (2.4GHz)<br>
150GB Raptor<br>
2GB Corsair PC3200 twin mx<br>
ASRock 939N68PV-GLAN<br>
X-Fi extreme music<br>
8800GT<br>
<br>
I am thinking of buy the following parts and keeping my 8800GT and X-FI and Raptor.<br>
<br>
<br>
CPU E8500 <br>

Theres a good forum for asking questions and you can spec it out there and buy it somewhere else cheaper.<br>
I went from something similar to what you have now (opteron 165) to <br>
q6600 GO @3ghz under arctic freezer pro 7<br>
gigabyte p35c ds3 version 2.0(loads of rear usb )<br>
2 gb geil ram<br>

It's only cheaper because it's slower, you're choosing between 2GB @ 1066MHz or 4GB @ 800MHz, not sure how they compare against each other nor can I be bothered to find out...<br>

that could be correct edge.  my understanding is that 64 bit (vista) makes better use of the quad core than 32 bit (xp).  here's a link keefy about the wolfdale (intel) E8500.  it shows some benchmarks overclocked and stock, and also compares it with a Q6600, E8400,  and some amd's.  i think its a pretty good article:  <a href="http://hothardware.com/Articles/Wolfdale/?page=1" class="postlink">http://hothardware.com/Articles/Wolfdale/?page=1</a><br>
<br>
as for the ram.  if you're going to keep running xp, you won't benefit from 4gb... you cant get it all from a 32 bit os.  so you technically waste some money for a little over 3gb in reality.  save some money and go with 2 1gb sticks... or not.  just dont mix your sticks... like your current pc-3200 with the ones you linked to... pc2-8500???</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for that link cellar Dweller it has convinced me to go dual core rather than quad because I do mostly gaming  and on the source engine which the E8500 excelled in on the tests, I do encode the odd video now and then but not enough to warrant a need for a quad core I feel, besides the E8500 was faster than the Q6600 at encoding the test video.<br>

<br>
At the most 32-bit Os's can use up to 4GB of RAM. Has to do with the hardware limitations or 32 bit. 32bit data path to the cpu limits it i believe. XP will only show you 3.25 GB of RAM. If it uses the rest its using it as graphics memory instead. All the services and shit still are in you're 3.25 GB area.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

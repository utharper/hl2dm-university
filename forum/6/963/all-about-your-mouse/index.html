	<div class="content">Finding a good mouse and having it work correctly is driving me nuts. I have been through:<br>
<br>
MS Laser 6000<br>
Logitech MX518<br>
2 Razer Copperheads<br>
Logitech G5<br>
<br>
Each one was so different. Of all of them I liked the copperhead best, but the drivers eventually would not detect the mouse and they broke so quickly. I bhop fastest with the G5, but whenever I run the setpoint drivers with it, MOUSE5 doesn't work. I kill the setpoint and it works, but then the DPI changer becomes active, which I don't want. A lot of people like the MX518, but for me it was a twitchy mess. What gives?<br>
<br>
I read somewhere that the color of your mouse pad makes a difference, so is your mouse optical sensor or laser, and what color surface are you on? I'm curious to know if it makes any difference, as I had never heard of this before.<br>
<br>
Is anyone else using G5 and had button failure in game?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Razer Deathadder here.  Ergonomically, I love it.  But I have had issues with firmware and drivers.  <br>
<br>
Most of the problems I've encountered involve mouse2 and the mouse wheel.  The mouse2 would tend to stick (but not physically) and cycle repeatedly whatever action assigned until you change weapon.  This was not good upon spawning with grenades.  But a firmware update seemed to resolve that.  Man, was that firmware update a pain in the ass though.<br>
<br>
Lately, the mouse2 seems to get confused with wheel-down.  Sometimes if I quickly tap mouse2 (grabbing with grav gun for example), it pulls up the SMG (assigned to wheel down) and fires off the SMG grenades.  Not good!  I suppose I need to check and see if this is a common issue with the Deathadder... and another firmware issue.<br>
<br>
I really have no other experience with any other...mouses?... mice?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The first one I had was a 518 and it never gave me a problems, that mouse still works and I took it back home. When I got back to college I decided on using another 518 and for the first months it worked fine. recently however Iv had occurances where I just cant move around with the mouse for a second or so, this also translates to my keyboard sometimes( I have an Eclipse II) I think its the cable. I also thought it might have had to do with the surface I was using, which was none.  <br>
Anyway I recently got the Razer Exactmat and that has been a wonderful choice. its large and the surface is perfect for gaming. havent had any issues since I started using it, oddly enough.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I used a G5 for a while.  Loved the 500Hz update rate, but the scrollwheel was horrible, often either skipping or doubling scroll actions, and scrolling when I just wanted to middle-click.  I had two G5s, and they both did this.  I took many radiators to the head because of it.<br>
<br>
I managed to get a sweet deal on a G9, and its scroll wheel is a 300% improvement over the G5's.  It took a little bit to get used to the somewhat weird thumb buttons, but it was worth it for a scroll wheel that works.<br>
<br>
Neither the G5 nor G9 needed special drivers to work for me on XP or 2000.<br>
<br>
I would recommend a G9 as long as you can find it for &lt; $70.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I only wish the yaw/pitch/side/forward settings could be turned down past 0.022, that would make the mouse sense more customisable. Well if i recall correctly one or 2 of those settings can be but thats no use if they arent all the same setting (to me). If it was the case i would be using 0.001 or lower.<br>
<br>
U may think ive gone too far but it is necesary wen u use high dpi at higher sensitivity, the way it is now is very smooth and accurate, ppl allways talk about low sensitivity and how u should have to move ur mouse  xcm to turn xdegrees, but the important thing is that u can move ur mouse without skipping too many dots, the other thing about low sense is i cant use my desk with mouse as it is fucked, and mouse pad room is limmited, but i also hate moving the arm around too much, makes me lazy kinda.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Alot of buttons that i can bind on it plus the tilt left and right of the wheel is handy. But when i got it i notice that my mouse sensitivity keep changing making it hard for me to adjust as well if it occasionally it died on me where the mouse gets slower and slower. But installing the cl mouse fix has solved that. Only problem i got is that enoying clicky noise from the wheel.<br>
G9 i don't like the look of does not seem it will fit in my hand as good as the G5 may be if they installed the same hardware and software into the G5 and add two more buttons on the right side i might buy one.<br>

	<div class="content">I have used mx518's for about 3 years, loved em. When the G5 came out bought it and had a few issues only having one side button ( went back to 518). The G5 second edition came out two side buttons, got it, got used to it and love it.<br>
The new setpoint 440 drivers and software work great, did have issues with the prior set 4.0 tho and was doing like fearsome said using the windows drivers.<br>
<br>
<br>
WT I recommend you try the new setpoint version released last month, and then go in the settings and assign a keystroke to each mouse button, except mouse 1 and 2. I also allow the setpoint to overide windows settings in game keeping the acceleration to none and pointer speed to 50%. In the game mode settings, I have checked keep mouse speed,  keep mouse acceleration, and keep keypress assignments.<br>
<br>
I also personally like to deactivate the mouse sensitivity + - buttons on mouse and also assign keystrokes to them for using binds. When disabling the ability to change mouse sens on the fly, I lock it on the top highest setting making it 2000 dpi, I set report rate to 500.  My in game sens is 3.0 for everything except aim arena where I drop it to 2.0. I would run 2.0 all the time for the added benefit of mag accuracy, but it hurts my movement too much in maps where you need to move fast.<br>
<br>
The amount of things you can bind to the mouse is amazing. I have 11 actions total bound to mouse, and use them all frequently.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have had two of the mouses you mentioned, the Copperhead and the mx518.  The Copperhead failed maybe two weeks after I got it, and I was fo fed up with bad support, bad drivers, insanely complicated firmware flashing procedure, that I didn't even send it back for another.  Felt like shit in my hand aswell.  The mx518 I thought was great, it did every movement I wanted without any negative acceleration and had nice tracking.  But eventually failed due to wear associated with the cord where the mouse constantly connects and disconnects from the usb port (not acctually physically disconnecting) under high load such as bhoping or movement in general.<br>
<br>
The mouse I am going to trying next is the Razer Death Adder.  Its currently being touted as the top fps gaming mouse on the market, even over the Lachesis.  Its user reviews are the highest I can find amoung tech reviews and user reviews alike.  According to the razer knowledge base the firmware flashing procedure has been simplified since the Copperhead, and the updated drivers and firmware for the Death Adder seem to have taken care of all reported bugs.  So really this looks like the best bet for high end mouses.  Really the biggest plus is how much more simple updating the firmware is over the Copperhead, cause the copperhead kicked ass it was just a pain, in the hand and my ass.  From what I've researched,  Death Adder = pwnage.<br>
<br>
I have read a lot of reviews stating that ones mousing surface is nearly as important as the mouse.  Not so sure about color but just about every review I've read for a top rated mouse pad say that the improvement was very noticable and beneficial.  The mouse pad that i currently use is one of Allsops attempts at a gaming mouse pad.  It is blue, grey, white, and black and I had to troulbe tracking on it with my mx518 before it bit the dust.  When I switched to the Allsop I noticed a decent improvement over a stock dell mouse pad.  But Allsop are not quality for gaming, so im geussing a pad from say, Razer might make for a larger difference in performance.  <br>
<br>
I'm going to be trying Razers'  Mantis Control Mat in conjunction with the Death Adder thats on its way.  This mat recieved good reviews (reviews for a mousepad lol) and its HUGE so you'll never slide of your pad again.  Its also a cloth pad so i'm guessing it won't wearout mouse feet nearly as fast as the hard mousing surfaces that are gaining popularity.  If you can find one though Razers new Destructor surface is supposed to be uber.  But I haven't been able to find a place that sells them, even razer which has been out of stock on their website for a while.  <br>
<br>
Whew, well theirs my 2 cents.  I've read more reviews for computer hardware and peripherals in the past 2 months than I can fathom so I'm not even gonna try to source any of whats above.  Good luck with your search, gaming mice are bitches :evil:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

518 for me was a twitchy mess. At times I would try to do a nice smooth curve for bhop and it would go too quickly through one part then stall and skip through the other, causing me to either not turn at all, or find myself turning on the spot and losing my sense of direction.<br>

Switch to G5 and Im bhopping so smoothly its ridiculous compared to 518.<br>

<br>
you won't ever notice it unless you use a low sensitivity - just try moving your mouse to a point in the game while your mouse is on the far left of your mouse pad, then go slowly to the far right of the pad. Then try it again, except go really fast the second time - it wont go as far if you do it fast enough D:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<strong class="text-strong">**UPDATE**</strong><br>
The Destructor gaming pad by Razer is now back in stock at razers site, <a href="http://www.razerzone.com" class="postlink">http://www.razerzone.com</a>.  Rather pricey, but they say that it has shown to improve tracking in laser mice by 37% and 25% for optical mice over other top gaming oriented mouse pads.  Might just be hype, people who have used it are saying it roxzors though.  $39.99 is a little steep for a mouse pad seeing as how you can get their Mantis series for $19.99 at Newegg.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I had to 518s and wore both primary buttons out within months.<br>
I liked it very much though.<br>
I went to the copperhead and i love and hate it!<br>
First off, where did they get the F'in shape for this thing?<br>
It is not very comfortable.<br>
And why is there a rubber ridge over the side buttons ?!?!?!<br>
WTF!<br>
Took a sharp blade and carved that sucker right off.<br>
Then, WHY NOT ONBOARD FIRMWARE!!!<br>
WTHELL!!<br>
"No mouse drivers were detected!<br>
Every so often, the damned thingh would stop working and the firmware and drivers would disappear, requiring hooking up ANOTHER mouse to load them?!?!?!??!?!<br>
<br>
I don't even use the frickin drivers and suggest that no one uses the drivers that come with a mouse.<br>
<br>
After all that, it is the most responsive and fast mouse out there i have tried and has improved my game.<br>
<br>
Not to hijack, but here is another hardware thing.<br>
Bought the newest Saitek Eclipse. Had the original but the thing was backlit, defeating the purpose. The new one has etched keys so the light shines through, very cool for turning out the lights and playing.<br>
BUT!!  in the process of making a key with translucent etching, the keys are not very strong and my crazy strong hands (from years of carpentry, fixture work, and powerlifting) have broken TWO control keys! Thats right. i replaced the first with the right one, broke that in two and now have backslash key there~!<br>

Yeah my copperhead was buggy as hell, neither the drivers or the firmware were very good and quite unreliable.  My firmware just never wanted to flash for me....great precision but everything else was questionable.  I think its the buggiest mouse they've released.  The Death Adder seems, ergonomic, easier firmware flashing, and only reported major bug is a motherboard incompatability thats been since fixed by a firmware update.

Hit and miss i guess..  Ive only had a few minor issues with it.. Like..  the light show and sometimes I have to re-plug it in because either the shift key or the keyboard itself stops typing.. the latter only hapened once tho..  quick fix by reconnecting it tho so no worries.. I have had no more issues with it either.  The light show showed up at around 4-7 days later.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The feet are way better than the 518 and look like they will last longer.<br>
Can change the polling to a max of 1000 but only if drivers are installed. I use 500 becasue i find 1000 uses upto 15% CPU on a X2 4800  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> when moving mouse fast.<br>
Like the profile and macro manager, create different sens and binds for different games/applicatons.<br>

Someone said something about mouse mat colours, I would say red si the worst for optical mice, just like typing in white text on a white background is bad.

	<div class="content">I'm pretty sure I do need new mouse feet, because I do notice the mouse feeling like it sticks.  But I'm not convinced anymore that this is my issue.  It's really perplexing me.<br>
<br>
As I said, I try to turn during a bhop or strafe jump, and I go straight.  This happens more frequently the longer I play.  I also notice some "warping" like animation.  At first, I thought maybe I was lifting the mouse from the surface due to sticking.  But I've been paying closer attention while playing and I'm not lifting.  I think I'm turning, go straight, animation kinda freezes, then animation warps the direction I intended to go.  It only happens while turning and never while going straight.  It's weird.<br>
<br>
I did check for DeathAdder upates and I updated my firmware.  Hasn't seemed to correct the issue.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Shit i dunno guys.  Razer does have a history of some products pwning for years and some crapping out randomly.  Its rather unfortunate considering how awesome their mice are...until they fuck up.  My copperhead had crazy problems that just popped up outa the blue and razer couldn't give me an answer, they just told me to send it in for a new one.  Utilize the warranty, that my best piece of advice if you can't figure out how to clean the optics or that doesn't help.  I dunno its weird anomalous malfunctions like what you guys are experiencing that has driven me to keep ALL of the original packaging and documentation that came with any piece of electronics I buy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

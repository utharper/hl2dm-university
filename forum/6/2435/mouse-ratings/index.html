	<div class="content">I came across this site awhile ago, which was a deciding factor on my original purchase of a mx518, and the sequential purchase of another after my son destroyed the first.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"> <br>

<br>
I dont understand all the techinal jargon, but the mx518 was and still is quite cheaper than the g5, yet is so much better.  amazing and scandolous; all at the same time.   another gaming gimmick perhaps?  Nothing like a new name with old technology to boost sales and dupe the masses.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"><br>

excerpt taken from g5 rating:   <br>
The G5 is an improvement over the G3 if you prefer some of the added features: extra buttons, tilt wheel, dpi display, weight cartridge. However the poor laser performance doesn't justify the increased price tag in my eyes. Infact it seems like madness to spend more on a G5 instead of the vastly superior MX518, unless you really, really want the weight cartridge.<br>
Perfect Control: 1.30 m/s (51"/s)<br>
Malfunction Speed: 1.35 m/s (53"/s) <br>
<br>
This is the spec for the mx518:<br>
<br>
Perfect Control: 2.03 m/s (80"/s)<br>
Malfunction Speed: &gt; 4.5 m/s (177"/s)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">idk about all that noise, but i use the deathadder. fucking love it. fits the hand perfect, cant see myself using anything else. but i think a mouse is personal preference, some might be better then others but what fits your hand and is most comfortable is the mouse for you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">right on.  I just figured I would post something to waste time, and thought it a good idea.  I used it initially because of budget concerns, and this being the first game Ive played mulitplayer with the computer before, I heard that a mouse and make a difference...<br>
<br>
but like you said though, personal preference.  I can gaurantee you I will buy another mx518 if this one is annihlated by my son. (thirds a charm I hear) If their still in production that is.<br>
<br>
oh yeah, it also makes me feel good knowing (according to this random site, with tests done by some random dude) that at the time I payed almost 40 dollars less than the g5, and supposedly own something superiour.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i never buy anything at bestbuy, but as for a mouse and/or keyboard, i suggest going to the store, not the internet.  they have all the mice laid out, you can hold them all and feel which one fits best.  some mice have  like ten buttons on them, i dont see the need but again, personal preference. you do wanna make sure the mouse has a good polling rate tho. mine is at 1000hz</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Teh old G5 had only one thumb button which put me off instantly so i chose a 518 usedit for about 2 years then the right click isstarting to go and the feet worn dow so I bouthg a G9 which is a great mouse if a little expensive however i think the mx518 will outperform it in terms in those tests.  @2000DPI and 0.61 sens my G9 starts to not respond but crank it up to 3200DPI it is fine.<br>
It all boils down to if you are a low sens or high sens player.<br>
Low sens you should buy an optical becasue they can handle the fast movements needed for 180 flick shots</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I just went back to razer from G5 and it is way better. Who knows, it could be the style of use, sensitivity settings, the computer it's attached to etc. I just know that I was struggling to move after I got it and since going back to razer I can move well again and my mouse clicks react way faster. <br>
<br>
My aim is off because I haven't figured out the correct sensitivity yet, but that is normal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you have high sensitivity then you should get the G5/G9 if you have low sensitivity you should get the MX518. The difference is the G line is laser based and while it provides a finer more accurate read of the surface it does not have a large surface area it scans so it can have trouble knowing what happened during fast mouse movement. But this mouse will do better at high sensitivity with its higher accuracy. If your sensitivity is low you should go with the 518 the top mouse in the optical mouse category. This is likely your problem WT you can also try to swap mousing surfaces another big factory that people miss. It is popular now for mouse pads to come flat black but that really is not a good surface for most mice, however most gaming class mice can track on it just not as well as they could on a surface with more variance in color and texture per area. If nothing else you can take a sharpie and draw all over your mouse pad to create variance in the image.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah everyone keeps telling me to go optical, but what is funny is that the best mouse I ever had was the copperhead which was laser based, while I found the 518 to be a jittery mess when aiming. The optical sensor couldnt handle the tiny precision movements I make, since I am a relatively high sens player compared to most. <br>
<br>
Two copperheads dead later, I decided to try the logitech equivalent, the G5, hoping I wouldnt wear it out as fast. I thought I just needed to get used to it, but man it was bad for me. I couldn't even do the lift jumps in aim with it most of the time. I would be making a nice smooth arc off the lift and its like the mouse just stops reading and then accelerates too fast through the motion and I would fall. I could make those jumps almost 100% with my old mouse and suddenly I was only making it 50% of the time.<br>
<br>
Just picked up the razer lachesis and now I can move again. Yes it is laser, but the copperhead was so good for me I figured this one likely would be too. G5 versus lachesis? With the G5 my strafe jump went to shit, it would accelerate through one part of the arc too fast, almost like trying to strafe jump with your sensitivity set way too high, but only for half the movement and not all the time.<br>
<br>
What I don't get is why, with the same DPI and windows settings, I have to set my in game sensitivity down from 7 to 2 since changing from the G5 to the Lachesis. Is that because of polling rate or what?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The laser engine in the lechasis is newer and possibly lots more accurate than the G5.<br>
Does your lechasis have the latest firmware, a clanmemeber has one and he was always complainign about the crosshair moving by itself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Razer deathadder is the best by far, and freaking great for low sens (almost 4 m/s without any reading problems D; )</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

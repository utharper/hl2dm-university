	<div class="content">There is no best. You will just have to buy them all and find the one you like.<br>
<br>
Seriously, start with trying them for the comfort factor. All the newest gaming mice have 50,000 dpi and super scanning lasers and mega polling and 18 side buttons. <br>
Razers are fast twitchy and buggy and uncomfortable and awesome.<br>
518's are comfortable, light weight and have onboard drivers for easy operation.<br>
G5s are heavier.<br>
<br>
For gaming, make sure it is wired, has 1800 to 2000 dpi, 500 to 1000 polling rate and some side thingys.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You shouldnt choose between these mice IMO. Copperhead and lachesis have both the same design. You should make it a G9 vs Deathadder. I had the lachesis at home to compare with my deathadder and all i can say is hands away from that crappy design. The mouse just doesnt fit to your hand, its horrible. Something else to the lachesis.. due to its endless dpi you get the following problem. As soon as you move the mouse it wont recognise mouse clicks and it moves all the time a bit because its so sensitive. Cant tell about the G9 tho. Buy the Deathadder and the G9 and try them at home.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Some people that complain about the razers might have larger hands (like me) and the mouse feels like its way to small, the mx518, and g5 fit well in a larger hand. Havent tried the g9 yet so I cant comment on that yet, but from the looks it seems to be a mid sized mouse.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I second the recomendation for the Death Adder, I just got mine 2 days ago and it excedes my expectations.  Not too small, excelent button response, smooth accurate tracking, nice ergonomic right handed feel, nice side buttons, its really quite awesome lol.  Just right with the weight, certainly the best mouse I have used, even over mx518 which is the most comfortable mouse ever.    The Death Adder is definately worth your consideration if you haven't already made your purchases.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yes the Death Adder is very nice imo.  I have small hands though, so that may be a factor.  I just like how the mouse kind of curves to my hand shape.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have rather large hands so it really works great for me.  It does seem to build a bit on the large side but that is much prefferable to the half sized mouse I was using before.   The large profile of the DA really helps me to get a firm full hand grip, which seems to give me superior control over finger tipping.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its how often your mouse refreshes its signal.  So a mouse with a 1000hz polling rate is refreshing its signal to the computer every 1ms.  At least i'm pretty sure thats how it works lol.  So with a higher rate more of your actual mouse movement is being sent to the computer, resulting in better more accurate tracking.   So 500hz with be 2ms and 125hz would be 8ms.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

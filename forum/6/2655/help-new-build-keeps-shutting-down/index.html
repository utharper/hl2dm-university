	<div class="content">i need some advice.  first, the system:<br>
<br>
Ultra XBlaster Clear Side Blk Mid-Tower Case <br>
Asus P5N-D nForce 750i SLI Socket 775 Motherboard <br>
CPU INTEL|Core 2 Duo E8500 3.16G 775 45N R<br>
MEM OCZ SLI-Ready Edition 4GB (2 x 2GB) 240-Pin DDR2 800 (PC2 6400) Dual Channel Kit <br>
PSU Thermaltake W0106RU 700W Complies with ATX 12V 2.2 &amp; EPS 12V version SLI Certified <br>
EVGA GeForce 9800 GTX + 512MB PCIe w/Dual Link DVI <br>
Masscool 120mm Sleeve Bearing Case Fan (x2)<br>
<br>
problem:  system powers off within 5 to 10 seconds of playing hl2dm.  no warning message prior to shutdown.  system can manually be powered on (doesn't reboot itself).  no warning message after powering back on.  system seems to run fine with all other operations (only hl2dm causes shutdown).<br>
<br>
some diagnostics that i dont know how to interpret:<br>
<br>
SPEEDFAN APPLICATION:<br>
Temperatures -<br>
Fan 1 (cpu) 1772rpm 37C<br>
Fan 2 (exhaust/back case) 2103 rpm 39C<br>
Fan 3 (intake/front case) 1974 rpm 22C<br>
Hard Drive 1 - 29C<br>
Hard Drive 2 - 28C<br>
ACPI (not sure what this really is, mobo?) 40C<br>
Core 1 (cpu) 35C<br>
Core 2 (cpu) 38C<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Core (graphics card) 49C</strong><br>
<br>
Volts (i know nothing about these)<br>
Vcore 1:  1.07v<br>
Vcore 2:  3.30v<br>
<strong class="text-strong">+3.3V:  0.00v</strong><br>
+5V:  5.05v<br>
+12V:  12.03v<br>
<strong class="text-strong">-12V:  -16.72v</strong><br>
-5V:  -5.96v<br>
+5V:  5.08v<br>
Vbat: 3.12v <br>
<br>
i bolded a couple items above that look suspicious to me, but i don't know how to interpret them.  i will say that although the graphics card idles hot, i can run the fan at 100%, cool it down to 39C, and hl2dm will still shutdown the system after 5-10 seconds.  so i really dont think its the graphics being a heat problem.  i also think the cpu temps look good.  so i'm leaning towards a power problem, and looking at those two bolded volt readings as an indicator of something.  but what???<br>
<br>
another possibility suggested to me is a problem with the memory.  i dont really know how to check that.  the bios sees the ram and it looks ok.  xp device manager also sees the ram and reports no problem.  but... i noticed the asus mobo guide does NOT list ocz memory under its qualified vender list (qvl) <a href="http://www.asus.com/999/download/products/2033/2033_10.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.asus.com/999/download/produc ... 033_10.pdf</a>  is that a possible problem, or is that just a brand asus never tested?<br>
<br>
lastly, the bios.  i've tried the default and i've tried changing a few things.  bottom line is that some of the bios settings are vague and google has been no help thus far.<br>
<br>
so... any and all suggestions are welcome.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

the powersupply thing is suspect to. i agree.  heres a link for the system monitor that I use.<br>

<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/" class="postlink">http://www.cpuid.com/</a><br>
<br>
there is the regular hwmonitor and then there is the pro.<br>
<br>
the nvidia control panel monitors, but its not accurate in my opinion, and my asus mobo has pcprobe to monitor and its the same as hwmonitor.  but hwmonitor uses way less resources and cpu time.  so,  maybe this will give you a different reading.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also in your bios you may have a thermalshut down temp which is lower than it should be, check that to see what it is. If you did not do a good job with your thermalpaste and Heatsink installation the temp could be spiking and shut down occurs to prevent damage, by the time you turn it back on the temp has lowered.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I see you have a post on the ASUS Forum too.  L2k is right about the BIOS.  Make sure you have the most recent build.  In the ASUS forum, there are a couple of posts about memory settings like SLI and timings.  You should also go to any forums on the OCZ site too.  All of the symtoms that you have, to me anyway, look like bad timings.  Look at your ASUS manual for instructions for setting the memory timings.  There should be a "By SPD" and "Manual" setting somewhere on the Advanced section of your BIOS.  You should also d/l  SiSoft Sandra Lite.  There is also a trialpay deal that you can look at if you would like the Pro Home Version.

	<div class="content">thanks for all the advice!  im still slogging through with no results... but all your suggestions are much appreciated.<br>
<br>
l2k:  its only a problem with hl2dm... no other operations/programs cause the shut down.  i have no other games to try.  i have flashed the bios to the latest revision 0801.<br>
<br>
dothedew:  im thinking you are on the right track with the memory timing and plan on looking into the forums at ocz.  unfortunately, the asus manual is pretty useless concerning the bios setup.  its just too vague.  i'll show you an example below... a list of my lastest reasearch projects.  yes, i posted on the asus forums... i tried to submit a technical question through their "form" and the drop down menu would allow me to enter or choose the correct mobo specs.  GAY!<br>
<br>
ok... used the 3dmark graphics test.  the system didnt shut down.  nothing of note reported.  i couldnt get the memtest86 to load during boot... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
i'm such a tard!<br>
<br>
some of the bios choices i dont understand that im researching (anyone who knows what these are please chime in!!!):<br>
<br>
C state compatibility (choices are c2, c3, or c4)<br>
ACPI suspend type (choices are s1&amp;s2, s1 POS, s2 STR)<br>
cpu multiplier (choices are a variety of numbers)<br>
ai timing (choices are auto, manual, standard, or ai overclock)<br>
<br>
memory timing setting (choices follow):<br>
tCL (cas latency)<br>
tRCD<br>
tRP<br>
command per clock (cnd)<br>
<br>
advanced memory setting (choices follow):<br>
tRRD<br>
tRC<br>
tWR<br>
tWTR<br>
tREF<br>
tRD<br>
tRFC<br>
<br>
*now, all those memory settings above default to AUTO in the bios.  the choice besides AUTO are numbers... like 1 thru 33.  so i need to understand what the t-letters mean!<br>
<br>
some other bios settings that i only glanced at:<br>

thats exactly what i was thinking about the AUTO settings since ocz isnt on the the qvl.  manually entering the correct timings might do the trick.<br>
<br>
yes, i ran 3dmark06 all the way through w/o a shut down.  i think that points away from the graphics card.<br>
<br>
i found this on toms hardware that is helpful for understanding regular timing settings:<br>
<br>
Q: How does memory access work, and what do the timings stand for? <br>
A: MEMORY ACCESS: <br>
1. tRCD (RAS to CAS Delay) 2-3 cycles, The row is selected by the Memory Controller. <br>
2. CAS (Column Address Strobe) 2,2.5,3 cycles (DDR), The Memory Controller selects the column and now the ROW is <br>
ACTIVE, and the READ COMMAND is sent. <br>
3. Data is sent to the DQ pins after CAS delay. <br>
4. tRAS (Row address Strobe) 6 cycles, The module waits a certain period of time for the data to be active. <br>
5. tRP (RAS precharge) 2 cycles, The Memory Controller DEACTIVATES the row. <br>
6. Memory Cycle repeats as requested by the Memory Controller. <br>
<br>
The timings are represented as follows: <br>
2-3-2-6 1T (CAS, tRCD, tRP, tRAS)<br>
<br>
havent found an explanation for the advanced timing settings yet.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
i noticed your 3.0 volt was zero, then you ran another test and it was 3.3 or something like that instead of 0.0  <br>
<br>
did you change something? or was it just a fualty diagnostic test?<br>
<br>
and also, in my unprofessional opinon about computer hardware, 65c for cpu temps is high.  <br>
i dont think ive ever gotten over 47c and thats was with some hardcore overclocking when i was experimenting...i was afraid my memory would burn up, becuase it overclocks that as well, at least the way I did it.  stock heatsink and fan.  i had 667 memory up to 760 something if i remember correctly.  <br>
<br>
did you apply thermal grease?  if you use to much it will act as a insulator instead of transfering it to the heat sink.  when i first assembled my asus m2n-sli board i used to much grease and my cpu was at those temps...i said, that aint right, this cpu never ran that high on my other mobo.  so i redid it and I have nice cool temps now for it.<br>
<br>
and it seems i read somewhere AMD run hotter than Intel...and I use AMD and you use Intel...<br>

UPDATE:<br>
<br>
last night i finally figured out how to run memtest86.  so it ran for 1hr 50 minutes... one complete pass... no errors.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>
<br>
i also ran cpu-z (from cpuid) so i could see what the bios auto option set the memory timings to.  the timing was showing 6-6-6-18.  so, i manually entered the ocz recommended timings of 5-4-4-15.  while i was at it, i also changed the voltage from 1.8 to 2.1, as recommended by ocz.  those changes DID have a positive effect.  hl2dm now runs almost 5 minutes (instead of 5-10 seconds)... but it eventually shuts down the system.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"> <br>
<br>
okay weird.  so i took some other advice and d/led a demo game from outside source.  i chose the smallest d/l i could find.  unreal tournament 4.  i ran ut4 for 30 minutes... no system shutdown.  seemed to run perfectly.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
<br>
thinking i had a buggy hl2dm game, i decided to uninstall hl2dm.  low and behold... there was no steam, no hl2, no hl2dm NOTHING showing in the add/remove programs.  wtf???  so i go to the start/all programs/steam menu... no uninstall option.  ???  so i go inside the steam folder itself... NO UNINSTALL!  WTF!  so my only option is right-click delete.  i hate doing that because im always afraid things linger in the registry w/o a proper uninstall.  now... i install hl2dm again.  this time from my disk.  run the game, same results... system shuts down within 5 minutes of playing.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation"><br>
<br>
i'm running out of options/ideas.  there could still be an issue in the bios settings that im getting no help for from asus.  this mobo also has some new fangled energy conserving properties that could be the issue... but again that would seem to point at a bios setting.  the fact that changing the memory timing made some improvement seems to point at the ram still.  not that the memory itself is bad, but that the bios auto is incapable of the proper settings. another unknown is that memory is also sli memory.  i could find no settings in the bios regarding memory sli.  but i dont really know what sli memory means.  i thought it meant that the memory was ready/capable of handling sli video card set ups.  but now im thinking it really means the memory itself has a sli setting?<br>
<br>
anyway, tonight i pull each memory stick and try to run hl2dm.  i havent gotten around to that because d/ling all those other things has been so time consuming.  i dont think this will point to a bad stick, but hopefully it may indicate that the memory sli options are borked.<br>
<br>
any other suggestions/ideas are welcome!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I would proceed with the removal of one ram module at a time, I would also do a couple of other things.<br>
<br>
1. go to system tools and look in event viewer then look under application and check the log, also check system log see what kind of events are taking place and google any error codes to see what they mean.<br>
2.download nvidia's ntune, run the system stability test, see what your results are.<br>
3.download nvidia monitor and run the system monitoring tools with graphs, then start and run hl2dm for a few minutes before it crashes alt tab out or quti game and look at graphs, see how the temps and resources (esp memory resources) were behaving while game was running.<br>
4. Be aware that drivers can cause this type of problem, go back over your driver installs and make sure that you installed the most current drivers for your chipset, graphics card, sound card and any other driver that should be installed.<br>

according to that info, i'm well within the cpu voltage range.<br>
<br>
seems i was incorrect about the 100C (not sure wtf i came up with that), the thermal specification is 72.4°C... "The thermal specification shown is the maximum case temperature at the maximum Thermal Design Power (TDP) value for that processor. It is measured at the geometric center on the topside of the processor integrated heat spreader."<br>
<br>
looking back at that Everest stress test i ran for only 50 seconds, the temp at that specific cpu point (mentioned above) climbed to 62C.  i dont think its bad to assume that hl2dm running for 5 minutes before system shutdown is pushing that temperature to 72.4 C.  so maybe i need to pull the cpu and thermal paste it again.<br>
<br>
i'll run that everest stress test longer tonight and watch that specific temp.  still, seems odd that hl2dm stresses the cpu more than ut4.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I ran nvidia monitor and at idle my cpu is 22 c<br>
I ran hl2dm for 5 mins and my cpu temp was 36 c<br>
so the game raised my cpu temp 14 c which in your case could put you near or over the temp threshold.<br>
I am running a AMD dual core that is water cooled with a very good water cooler system so the temps are going to be a lot different but I think it shows that if you are on air cooling the potential is there for your cpu to go up 10-20 c when running hl2dm.<br>
I kinda suspected based on the rapid shut down that it was due to the thermal protection feature in your bios and it looks like it very well could be.<br>

	<div class="content">What heatsink fan are you using, the one that came with the CPU? My rig runs at 33 degrees idle with aftermarket HSF and doesnt rise much at all with HL2DM running (dont recall the exact numbers but its nowhere near 60).<br>
<br>
It is possible that HL2DM is putting more load on the CPU than other games. I have always suspected it to be quite CPU intensive since I believe that was a major bottleneck for me on my old PC.<br>
<br>
I would perhaps consider purchasing a good aftermarket HSF and arctic silver thermal paste (I applied mine using an old credit card). Zalman and Thermaltake both get good reviews. Just make sure you have enough room for them as they can be quite big. Mine was pressed up against the north bridge when oriented in the direction I wanted, so I had to turn it so it extracted upwards.

well, i really wasnt discounting what you said.  i used the thermal compound on the intel provided heatsink first.  the cpu obviously ran hot, with both cores idling at 42-45C and the cpu case about the same.  i could watch those temps soar into the 70+ range within seconds of starting hl2dm.<br>
<br>
so when i pulled the cpu, wiped the factory thermal paste... applied new paste and reinstalled the cpu... i was ecstatic at seeing idle temps in the 38C range and stess test max in the mid 60's range.  those temps seemed to please other people too.  i think i just didnt run the stress test long enough... cause i'm a big chicken!  lol<br>
<br>
now that i've done more research, i think i applied the paste in the wrong direction for core 2.  but the paste i used is clearly superior to that factory shite and still showed major improvement in temps.  i dont think i used too much.  i'll be interested to see what it looks like after pulling the cpu tonight.  should be a good indicator of too much or too little.<br>
<br>
then im going to run a stress test called Prime95.  if the temps arent significantly better, i may pull the cpu yet again and try lapping the heatsink.  since lapping voids the warranty... i'll be forced to buy a different heatsink.  which i may have to do anyway.<br>
<br>

I pulled and pasted that @#$##$$#@# cpu heatsink four times!  Surprisingly to me, MOAR PASTE did the trick.  I still dont see a significant heat reduction in the two cores at idle.  Both stay around 37C-38C.  But the cpu case itself never gets above 64C while playing hl2dm.  The Prime95 stress test ran for 20 minutes and the cpu case temp topped out at 75C <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">   But the system didnt shutdown, and Prime95 reported no errors.<br>
<br>
Thats still too hot for my liking.  I would have to say that the heatsink intel provides for its E8500 is BARELY ADEQUATE!  You would think they could include a better designed system for their own chip.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone for your help and suggestions!<br>
<br>
So, I'll be shopping around for another heatsink in the future.  But for now, I'm just tired of fucking with it.  Plus, I'm a bit cash strapped atm.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

the above settings seemed to be performing perfectly.  idle cpu temp of 40C load 52C.  until last night.  while playing hl2dm for about 3 hours, the power suddenly shut off (no reboot).  exactly what was happening during the initial hsf overheating issue.  so checked temps again under load and the temps were as reported above.  the system still passes stress tests from Everest, 3DMark, Sandra, Memtest... w/o any errors or shutdowns.  grrrrrrrr!!!!!  <br>
<br>
back to the drawing board.  <br>
<br>
can low cpu voltage cause this type of shut down?  <br>
<br>
can HT, NB and SB volts cause this type of shut down?  <br>
<br>
memory... well i'm pretty clueless on this subject.  my rudimentary understanding is that as the cpu gets faster in an oc, memory should be loosened.  so again, can the memory timings cause this type of shut down?  if yes... what are some timings i should try?  5-5-5-15 2T?  6-6-6-18 2T???<br>
<br>
im really starting to suspect the psu now, so ive opened a ticket with thermaltake.  i still cant believe that 700w is insufficient.  but im wondering if the psu itself is overheating.  it has a large (140mm) fan on the bottom side... right over the top the cpu.  the fan is capable of moving air at 85 cfm.  but there is hardly any air discharge out the back of the psu.  i can visibly see the fan moving... but it still seems like a low air discharge out the back.  especially when compared to the 120mm masscool fan.<br>

I have an ASUS board, the asus updater is something I am not very confident in to flash the bios for me and install a new one...  I downloaded the newest bios for my board off their site, and I have a Flash Utitlity built into my bios.  I used that, then chose where to get the new bios from, and presto. New Bios, no quirks, no jerks.  I did try the updater first, and it was gay as hell. I uninstalled asus update and their asus probe that uses so much cpu and ram.<br>

this case came with 5 extra fans because I guess when it intially shipped some of the fans that came with it would not power on when set to low, all 3 speed fans.  I did not have this issue so I got to use all the fans, plus I got 5 extras, and it comes with a mount for the middle of the case to add another internal one.  Not sure if their still shipped with the extra fans or not... I got this case roughly 3 months ago from best buy with some reward zone money and some cash from scraping junk metal.  theres a junior version of this out there to, but it's significantly smaller.  <br>
<br>
Oh, W.T. I got that same cooler, for amd sockets, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835185125&amp;Tpk=freezer%2064%20pro" class="postlink">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... 2064%20pro</a> I think it's the same. I bought one after you posted it.  Thanks Man.  That thing rules dude, looks pretty too.  Lowered my idle by almost 10 celcious and in game my cpu for dm does not get above 38 celcious after a few hours of play.  L4D however tops my cpu temp out at 44 celcious.  And it blows the air right out the back exhaust fan as well, god bless that cpu cooler.  MUST BUY.<br>
<br>
Oh snap, just read my box that came with it...I installed it backwards.  the fan is facing the back, by the exhaust...but thats psuhing air through the cooler and the heat is being dispated towards the front of my case now...I need to flip this sucker around, might get a couple more degrees shaved off...now where's that damn thermal paste.  I assumed the fan was drawing it the other way, thus pushing it out the back of the case...nope, the fan pushed air through the cooler on this, not drawing through it...if that makes sense.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
wasnt ignoring your advice chem... but the only psu's bestbuy had over 700W cost $199.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised">  <br>
<br>
when i pulled the psu, i noticed the heatsink on the mobo was frickin hot!  maybe thats the thing overheating.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">its weird impala... the stability was worse with the standard clocks.  screen froze up within 15 seconds of loading windows.  the only semblence of stability came from a mild oc.  everything worked perfectly... except hl2dm after 2-3 hrs.<br>
<br>
anyways, here's a review of the psu im getting.  i upped the watts to 750, and with the newegg price and rebate... i'll break about even after the restocking fee and the shipping back costs for the older psu.<br>

if the new psu doesnt resolve the issue, i'll try the one memory stick test and standard clocks again.  asus assured me that mobo temps would not cause this kind of power shutdown, although it could contribute to an overall heating issue within the case.  i've known all along the BIOS settings were a part of the problem.  but i think i have that corrected for now.  we'll see.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

definately the power supply unit.<br>

the heat production on this psu compared to the other one is noticeably lower.  im sure the other psu had a fan issue and just wasn't spinning as designed to prevent the psu from overheating.<br>
<br>
not only does the psu run cooler, but the entire insides of the case now run 5C-10C cooler than before.<br>

played for about 3-4 hrs yesterday with no shut downs.<br>

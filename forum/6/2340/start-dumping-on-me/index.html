	<div class="content">Ok, I've looked into this scoreboard crash and the sound looping crash, and I need some other dump files to see if they all happen at the same point.<br>
<br>
If you can, send me the dump files with a description of what was happening when you crashed.  Maybe I can figure it out or give the guys at VALVe a specific address to look at.  Maybe we can get some kind of update that will fix this problem.<br>
<br>
E-mail your dump files to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a2e3f273a390a2226783a263f2d23243964292527"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="afcbdac2dfdcefc7c39ddfc3dac8c6c1dc81ccc0c2">[emailÂ protected]</span></a><br>
<br>
The time stamp on the dump file will be the same as when you crashed.  They can be found in your &lt;&lt;Path to steam&gt;&gt;\steamapps\&lt;&lt;username&gt;&gt;\Half-Life 2 Deathmatch<br>
<br>
The name will look like "Steam__3531__2008_8_5T18_32_30C1348812.mdmp"<br>
<br>
If I get enough dumps from different people then maybe I can figure the place that it happens and we can get it fixed.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

So far, found two places that the crash could happen -- dealing with animation sequences.  Even got some good dump files from Punk that shows the error happens at the same place across multiple updates.

	<div class="content">Yes it's an animation sequence problem.<br>
<br>
But for that many to crash at once ( which I've seen plenty of times ) I think it may have something to do with the map and or the game.  I know when I run the sdk in debug mode I get a bunch of animation errors on the crossbow.  It might be a sequence gets called on the clients ( for world model and view model ) and it causes the clients to crash.<br>
<br>
At the same time, It may have something to combine balls.  I know our map has a spawner, but I've seen it happen on maps without spawners as well.  I will say the most I remember this type of crash involves explosions.<br>
<br>
I wish I could get the debug symbols to troubleshoot this to know exactly what it is.  I'm going to send VALVe an e-mail about these two places ( both dealing with animation sequences ) to see if they can't get it fixed.  I'll also include the scoreboard crash that I can't troubleshoot because the SDK differs too much from the actual released game.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the dumps guys...keep them coming.  I got a strange one on Friday that hasn't matched any of the "normal" crashes.  But thanks to the dumps i have, I can give valve a direct place to look.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Turns out, it's not related to the scoreboard at all.  Or at least that's what the clues are pointing away from.  Those crashes match other crashes I've had in the middle of a round.<br>
<br>
So, I've put together a list of dumps and details about what I've found and sent it on to VALVe.  Hopefully we'll get a response or even better yet an update that fixes these two things.<br>
<br>
Thanks all!<br>

I'm hoping to collect the most common crashes so we can get them to fix them.   Let's see what they do with what I sent them before we collect any more.  I have a feeling if they fix the ones I sent that crashes will be vary rare and will probably be system dependent.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

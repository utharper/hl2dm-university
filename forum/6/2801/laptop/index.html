	<div class="content">For a laptop. I'd say look into HP's, Dells and Gateways. They usually have pretty good specs and are around your budget price. It all depends on what you plan on doing with it. I'd say Toshiba's too although they're a little pricier. <br>
<br>
I know you can set the filters on newegg and tigerdirect for price range so give that a shot. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">.<br>

I'm looking for one myself and I've found some good deals as well. Don't be afraid of refurbs either.<br>

For example heres one that I've been considering:<br>

<br>
I have a few questions again... : )<br>
<br>
I need more storage for my desktop. I'm planning to take my desktop to college, and I'm going to buy a laptop. I want a terabyte, and I'm not sure if I want an internal or external storage. I'm thinking I could buy an external, so it's be easier to transfer my files between the laptop. <br>
<br>
Will I know notice THAT much of a difference between a 5,400 RPM drive and a 7,200 RPM drive?<br>
<br>
Also, I want to spend between 1,000-1,300 while finding the best bang for my buck. I want a graphics card, 64bit Windows, and 4GB of RAM or more. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Here's a survey I found to better show my needs.</strong><br>
1) What is your budget?<br>
$1,000-$1,300<br>
<br>
2) What size notebook would you prefer?<br>
Anything in that price range.<br>
<br>
3) What tasks will you be performing with the notebook?<br>
Basic schoolwork, and gaming. <br>
<br>
4) Will you be taking the notebook with you to different places or leaving it on your desk?<br>
I'll most likely be taking it to class with me. <br>
<br>
5) Will you be playing games on it; if so, which games?<br>
HL2DM, TF2, Solitaire, Spider Solitaire. I'm not worried about playing the newer games on lower settings as long as they play. <br>
<br>
6) Are there any brands that you prefer or any you really don't like?<br>
Nothing that's going to break easily. <br>
<br>
7) How many hours of battery life do you need?<br>
At least 2 hours when I'm taking notes in class. I don't care about the battery life when I'm gaming because I'll be able to plug it in somewhere. <br>
<br>
8 ) Do you mind buying online without seeing the notebook in person?<br>
I can buy online. <br>
<br>
9) Please select your country's flag as a post icon and tell us what country are you buying this in.<br>
U.S.<br>
<br>
Screen Specifics<br>
<br>
10) Would you prefer standard or widescreen?<br>
Either/Or. Depends mainly on my budget. <br>
<br>
11) From the choices below, what screen resolutions would you prefer?<br>
<br>
1440X900<br>
<br>
12) Do you want a glossy/reflective screen or a matte/non-glossy screen?<br>
I don't know the difference. <br>
<br>
Build Quality and Design<br>
<br>
13) Are the notebook's looks and stylishness important to you?<br>
I don't care about the color or looks as long as it doesn't look girlish. : P<br>
<br>
14) When are you buying this laptop and how long do you want this laptop to last?<br>
I'll either be buying it in 3 weeks, or 3 months. I'm not sure whether it'll be better to buy it right after I graduate, or before I go to college. <br>
<br>
Notebook Components<br>
<br>
15) How much hard drive space do you want; 40GB to 200GB?<br>
If I buy an external terabyte, I'm not too concerned about the storage as long as it'll be able to hold all the downloads of TF2 and HL2DM. So probably around 500GB should be good. <br>
<br>
16) Do you need an optical drive? If yes, a DVD-ROM, DVD-CD/RW or DVD-RW drive?<br>
Probably DVD-ROM if I'm to buy something on the CD's.<br>
<br>
<br>

A terebyte is a shitload of storage I doubt you really need that much unless you are planning on storing a lot of big files and I mean a fucking lot.  You might be able to save some bucks if you go with 600 GB which should be plenty.  <br>
<br>
Also 64 bit windows can be buggy I have heard.  I wouldn't rcommend Vista if you can avoid it.  Might want to wait til Win 7 comes out.  Dunno.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've found a couple of reasons why I would want a gaming laptop. If I want go to outside, or go to starbuck, I can bring it with me. The keyboard may be a bit difficult to use if I were to do that, but I'd bring my mouse also. If I want to go home for the weekend, I'm not going to want to lug a desktop from the 10th floor of my dorm to my car, drive home, lug it inside, and set it up. I can just bring the laptop again. <br>
<br>
I filled up my 320 in no time whatsoever. I'm constantly downloading music and videos. I'm going to need some place to store them. Plus, with the prices so low now, why not just buy one terabyte? From just looking at newegg real quickly, the biggest price difference I found between a 640 and a 1000GB is 20 dollars. Some external 640's are even more expensive than the terabyte!<br>

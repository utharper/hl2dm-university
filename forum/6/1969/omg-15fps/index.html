	<div class="content">I was playing a league game on powerhouse and to my horror as i was playing i saw my FPS crash to 15fps. There was nothing i could so I had to hide most of the map.<br>
I would like to know why on earth did it drop so low because in previous games on this map my fps does not drop as much. But on in that game it did not sure if its the map or there server but i did not notice much choke or it my PC which usually gets around 100-250 fps so i don't see why it crashed so low on this map. <br>
Can someone explain to me what the problem could be because i don't want this to happen again. Also added note em using onty fps enhancer so it usually high fps I get.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think the problem was heat. I opened up my laptop had it for two years and damn the fan was clogged up with dust and like a wall of it was blocking the back vent. So i got a to the tooth brush and cleaned the entire insides. I also did a updated the driver but that only made it run slower so found the original driver and installed it and well i loaded the powerhouse demo and yay 100-200 frames. I think 15fps due to heat as well i think the video driver became corrupted. Just wished I did all this stuff before the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's like I'm playing all OK with 300 fps @ LD and suddenly it drops to 30 for example, for about 4 secs more or less, and funny thing is that the same thing happends when watching the demo.<br>
My pc is really good, so that shouldn't happen... it's something weird that I've got 3 times maybe (iirc).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">sudden drops in your fps may be caused by the game losing focus... alt tabbing down to windows and then back should fix it. you could as well try disabling/turning off unnecesarry background processes before playing hl2dm. eg firewall, anti virus software, browser, video/audio player, chat clients etc etc. leave only those running that are essential for windows and hl2dm to work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

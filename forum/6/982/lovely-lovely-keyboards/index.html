<br>
Ok So I'm just about fed up with my Saitek which is slowly dying on me when keystrokes are not recognized. It hasn't affected my gaming yet too much since it seems to be emerging from the right side of the keyboard. <br>
<br>
I don't know if its just because it hates me, its only liking the color blue, or I'm still haunted by hardware problems but I type ALOT and it gets very annoying whe I type something ad it looks like I had a seizure while I was typing.<br>
<br>
So<br>
Im looking at the lycosa for a replacement but I want the opinion on a few people for a good, sturdy replacement that happens to be backlit or something similar. <br>
<br>
So lets hear it! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

Keyboard errors while typing this single post: 8.<br>

<br>
Its much more comfortable, the butons are placed so much better, etc<br>
I have used the g15 b4, infact it sits on teh table next to me every night, its just a normal keyboard only it looks fancy and has macros, and probably more responsive though i have never had response problems with generic ps2 keyboards. I do like the light behind the keys though, good in teh dark.<br>

That said, my movement keys/fingers are basically the same as with a keyboad. The only thing that differs is the placement of the weaps keys.  It has 11 keys above the movement keys in a double row.  Also, it has different feel to the different keys (flat,concave or raised) depending on what class they are (weap, move, other).  The reason I tried it was its small enough to go on my keyboard shelf next to the mouse which is much more comfortable than having one device on top of the desk and the other on the shelf.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The fang is basically the left end of the merc cut off, and the space/jump button is on the side instead of where the space is on a normal keyboard so you have to learn somewhat different muscle movement/timing there.  It does take some getting used to but imo not any more than learning the correct spacing of weaps settups on a keyboard.  I agree that the finger placement is more comfy as well which is why I tried it.  The different shapes and feel of the keys helps too.<br>

Yes that's true, but for gaming I don't find backlighting that necessary anyways, since if I have to look for a key there is something wrong with my layout. I don't have the backlight on when I'm gaming in the dark (and mine has light coming through the letters). </div></blockquote>

Well for gaming I really know where all my keys are almost by memory so backlighting really isn't necessary. But I type, ALOT, and I cant memorize a full keyboard in the dark so thats why I want one. Makes meh life easier.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, ppl have allways told me that im alot more natural then anyone else they have seen(others just accuse of scripts <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">), 2 good reasons for that are good keyboard and good key mappings. The reason i say this is because i am able to perform anything in hl2dm, while bunnyhoping and i dont suffer any discomfort watso ever, and my fingers dont get sore, not even after like literaly 24 hours + straight gaming(my mousehand does though <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">). The most button intensive thign i used to do though was prolly bak wen u could double tap with grav gun, in Australia we considered it to be over the top (lame) to use mouse wheel so we did it manually, i was known for jumping around and constantly double tapping, meaning, sprint jump duck + taping 2 keys twice fast plus movement + wateva else, but then again wat i do in hl2dm pro could be more button intensive then that, the advantage gained from being able to smash through all your weapons fast puts it over most players.<br>
Wow does pern like to talk about himself or wat?<br>
Anyways, if ur curious about my cfg, even though u have never played me, here is wat i use, compare it to the claw layout an u will see the logic in it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

	<div class="content">Like mice, I've been thru many a keyboard. Since I've spent a good 20 years on my  keyboards daily, I started to get carpal tunnels and some type of tendinitis in my wrists. I seriously HAD to take a break from gaming once for like 6months to heal, Don't let this happen to you! Pay attention to your ergos or else!<br>
<br>
I used to use only flat keyboards like the saitek, logitechs and what not. They all seemed ok,. I even tried the one Joule has and couldn't get used to it although I liked the idea of it, the keypresses felt too soft and not very positive to me.<br>
<br>
On my doctors advice I switched to a Microsoft natural 4000 <em class="text-italics">ergo</em> keyboard with a split offset layout. This keyboard might take a few days to get used too, but the button action is great and very positive. The thing some might not like is that with your left hand its harder to reach the keys right of center, but you've basically got 30 keys to use on the left side.<br>
<br>
If anyone has had any wrist problems, I would highly recommend it as I have not had any problem with my left wrist since. This keyboard works for me mainly I think because I keep my keyboard on my desktop and not a tray (on a tray it would be hard I think). With a good adjustable chair you can get your arm positioning perfect and rest your forearms on the top of the desk comfortably, while keeping your wrist in the right <em class="text-italics">ergonomic</em> position's. I know this thing looks funny but it works great and I love it for both typing and gaming.<br>

Well, back to the Lycosa, I was weary about the keys because they are flat and people have said they feel like laptop keys.  But Newegg allows full refunds within 30 days of purchase so its worth a try I guess.<br>
<br>
Nice post L2K thats really sometihing to consider.  I have been getting some terrible pain in my left wrist after 3-4hrs gaming which I never used to get.  I bought a gel wrist wrest and this seems to make a large improvement becasue it keeps my wrist straight and keeps the palm of my hand above the keyboard a little bit.  It also might just have something to do with not gaming for 7 months and then logging 90hrs on hl2dm in the past 2 weeks, but I'm not convinced.  8) <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
On the subject of BB, I was totally surprised when I moved out to Bozeman MT and there was no Best Buy!! No BB or Circuit City.  I coudn't believe it, there must be NO gamers in this town or something.  I guess they are building a BB this coming spring but until then I have to rely on Newegg for just about all of my computer needs. The staples and Office Depots in the area don't even carry the few gaming mice they have on the main websites!  I just want a mouse and a keyboard and i want them NOW lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i was in bestbuy canada yesterday night.. and there was some guy pushing the 8600GTS 512 for $219 canadian.  It was funny.. the sales man was around 60 years old and was giving a lot of weird info .. not on purpose .. but he just didn't know his stuff.   I ended up telling the cx to go down the street to get a 8800GT for $220 LOL!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

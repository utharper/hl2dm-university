	<div class="content">Several people have asked me if I would make my headshot plugin an admin plugin so the HL2DM community would have something stable for us, rather than working with plugins that are based on CS:S or DOD:S.<br>
<br>
That being said, what would you like to see in a plugin, admin or otherwise?<br>
<br>
I already have some combat modes in the works.  1v1 matches, elimination mode, and so forth.  I'm also working on a way to make my plugin talk with other servers who also have the same plugin so you can practice/play on one server while waiting in line to play a match on another server.<br>
<br>
I have a forum on my hl2plugin website, but not many people post there.  I'm hoping I'll get some good ideas here.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

	<div class="content">I think a "barebones" HL2DM admin plugin would be nice. My wishlist would be:<br>
<br>
* votemap<br>
* motd<br>
* timeleft<br>
* A function to play sounds<br>
* kick and ban options<br>
<br>
I will try to think of other ideas and get back to you.<br>

	<div class="content">- GUI's definitely the most important. Things like being able to choose teams, spawning AFTER hitting OK on the MOTD, being able to spectate, etc.<br>
<br>
- Fun modes would be cool. Crowbar vs Pistol? Zombie mode? Gravity Gun only (this would be really popular)?<br>
<br>
- Weapon restrictions would be nice for a map no one likes such as Overwatch. Take out the RPG!<br>
<br>
- Anti-crash! Somehow! Maybe pause the game when someone crashes. Would be useful for 1v1s. Or if someone says AFK or BRB, it would pause the game. Obviously disallow this in public games.<br>
<br>
- Anti-cheat too. Admins should be able to subtly spectate suspicious players or force them to take a screenshot and send it to the admin.<br>
<br>
- Perhaps an announcer and a crowd like in the Super Smash Bros. games? When someone does something amazing like kill 6 people in a matter of 10 seconds or gets several Magnum headshots in a row, the crowd could go wild. If someone's about to reach the maximum kill count, the announcer could say this.<br>
<br>
- Allow players to use specific skins like the Rebels' medics, but restrict it so they don't turn into a seagull or something.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Speaking of which, once I've finished my current map I plan to start remaking maps for the DMU server... we don't need a plugin, we just need more considerate mappers. Removing the weapons from the map wouldn't help as most the maps don't have weapons, what we need to do it strip the players of the weapons they spawn with, which is simply done in hammer.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This removes just the RPG and its ammo.

I found a map specific cfg plugin for sourcemod <a href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=48022" class="postlink">https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=48022</a>  so using thta you could name the above CFG jumpmaps then get the plugin to exec it on all jumpmaps in rotation.  Hopefully.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

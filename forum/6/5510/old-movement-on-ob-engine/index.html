	<div class="content">Just in case you want the old movement from before the update back. There is a Sourcemod plugin to remove the no-sprint-after-crouch-bug. There is still a small delay left but it's a big improvement compared to how the movement is now!<br>

If you want to test it go there: 85.131.139.225:27015 (Germany based server, high ping for most of you I guess, but it should do for tests).<br>

I would say no.<br>
<br>
For me playing the game now is way to frustrating knowing that I should be able to dodge an attack just like I did for the last five years and get away, not being stuck at low speed cuz I just came out of a crouched bhop.<br>

Frustrated game play is not fun game play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Mods never work ... especially when they are made for a game that is pretty much dead anyway.  Don't get me wrong, DM is all I'll play.  But as a general rule, the entire mod process is too complicated for most users.  I have worked on several mods that were greatly desired and sought after.  Once released it lasted about a week before the number of servers and players dwindled to nothing.  Which is the reason I decided to just stop working on those types of projects and write something for server operators to be able to make the current game more fun.<br>
<br>
Back in the Quake days, mods would download upon connection and the user could easily use them without having separate downloads and setups.  It was much easier then.  But those days are gone, and while this mod was a decent idea, it probably won't last long.  Nobody wants to support and keep up code that only a few people use.  Which is why you also don't see VALVe doing much with it either.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think this pretty much sums it up and Impala I don't think I have ever seen a more legit post.<br>
<br>
I can't believe that people are to fucking lazy or too retarded to download and install this mod, yet they can complain nonstop about valves 10 minute piece of crap update to no end.<br>
It makes no sense to me, if you want to play the game and a good version of it at that play the mod, otherwise stfu and don't ever support valve for anything as they have not supported us at all, ever.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Holy fuck. <strong class="text-strong">THE <span style="text-decoration:underline">ONLY</span> REASON THAT PEOPLE AREN'T PLAYING THE MOD IS BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO LAZY TO GET THEIR MAPS AND CONFIGS WORKING.</strong> "Wahhhh i need 2 dl maps omg. also my cfg borken!!!! Im gonna keep playing this absolutely terrible excuse for an updated version of hl2dm cause i'm too much of a lazy fucking idiot".<br>
<br>
It took me around 10 minutes or less to configure my maps folders by linking them (this is insanely easy to do), get a custom crosshair, and get the game configured to the point where it performs better than any version of hl2dm ever has for me. <br>
<br>
Factually, HL2DM:OB is far superior in every single way than the update and also AG2's vanilla hl2dm mode. If you think AG2's hl2dm mode is completely accurate, you might not have eyes. Or hands. I'm not bashing AG2, I'm just saying it's only good for the pro-mode.<br>
<br>
If you have windows vista or windows 7, all you need to do is open command prompt in administrator mode, delete your hl2dmOB maps folder (except save dm_lockdown and dm_overwatch, because sub-zero updated them without renaming and you'll have missing map errors) and type this<br>
<br>
mklink /D "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\SourceMods\hl2dmob\maps" "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\YOURSTEAMNAME\half-life 2 deathmatch\hl2mp\maps" <br>
<br>
and hit enter. That's literally all you need to do. The first filepath is the one that is created upon hitting enter. This is why you deleted your hl2dmOB maps folder. This will save you from EVER having to download any maps that you previously had in hl2dm. They will automatically work on all servers in hl2dmob. <br>
<br>
Fact: The hitreg in HL2DM:OB is 99.9% as accurate as the recent updates. (I find it to be more accurate, because it allows for 100 / 100 /100000)<br>
Fact: There are more models to play as<br>
Fact: Movement is actually marginally smoother than it was ever before.<br>
Fact: <strong class="text-strong">VALVE WILL NOTICE WHEN A GOOD CHUNK OF IT'S PLAYERBASE STOPS PLAYING IN FAVOR OF A MOD THAT IS BETTER IN EVERY WAY.</strong><br>
<br>
It's making me rage so hard to see all these stubborn people continuing to play HL2DM. It is NOT a good update. More bugs exist than there were in the first place, and they could not have more blatantly disregarded all of the things we ever suggested to them. <span style="text-decoration:underline">All</span> the things that occured in the update were just natural effects of moving to the OB engine.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, the more I think about it the more you are right. It's funny how they completely ignored all of the bugs that accumulated and that we informed them of. Many of the same old ones still exist. They couldn't care less about hl2dm :/<br>

That pretty much sums it up. You not only have to compete with HL2DM but also hl2dmpro. <br>
<br>
If you guys want subzeros OB mod to do something you have to shell out your own money and get some servers going. You have to convince eFPS to make it the required game for league play or start a competing league that is only in OB. Then it has a chance it will never have the player numbers that exist in hl2dm but maybe it wont matter if those player numbers are similar. IE on any given day I can find about 1 or 2 servers that have stock settings and 1 other decent player in them. As it is there is only a hand full of people in this community that actually shell out money for servers and of those most are unwilling to move them to OB. <br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that many of the players out there LOVE this update because it has reduced some of the speed of advanced players. <br>
<br>
Also I remember hearing something about free steam accounts not working with mods so there are many players in HL2DM that only have a free account are they able to run the mod?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

no, they are not.<br>
<br>
and the mod has some issues that would prevent it being a good replacement for league play.  it has the foundation for becoming a good league option.  but not as is.  there are some quirks that still need tweaking.  i.e. the 9mm being able to kill you faster than the ar2.

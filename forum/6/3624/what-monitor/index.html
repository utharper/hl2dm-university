Im running an old 19" crt atm, 848x480 @150hz, and its worlds better than any of the modern lcds ive tested. Being locked at one resolution and 60hz refresh (not to mention ghosting due to response time) is just far too much of a negative to make up for an lcds positive aspects (not that they appear to have any, with regards to gaming anyway).<br>
<br>
Lcds that claim 75hz refresh are just adding 15 frames of nothing (black screen) to the 60 frames of actual image to achieve that effect, btw.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">As down falls such as ghosting are mainly seen in cheap monitors by poor brands. Research should be done on monitor it self that your going to buy as most know your standard cheepy LCD perform very badly. Main issue is that it still fairly new tech and some manufactures do not know how to properly get the most out of it (crt have been around a long time allot of tunning went on in that time). That why most recommended Samsung as a tft monitor because they have been throwing allot of money at r&amp;d so the screens they make have little flaws in it with very high quality results. Actual Samsung comes with software the sharpens up the colour and contrast almost as good as the crt. <br>
<br>
As for the refresh rate I really don't think having a high frequency will make at all the difference as long as the monitor is no less than what your eye can see. I Don't think you will see much LCD screens with more than 60hz even though it is possible to achieve its just that there is little or no benefit from it and costumers couldn't care less only reason why its not a issue compared to crt is that it uses analogue signal and you needed the ability to change the frequency to work smoothly with your system. Where as latest LCD monitors work in digital where refresh rate has not much of a effect on how it performs (you should use the dvi connection btw for the best picture). <br>
<br>
Only thing you got to look for is low response time, a good contrast ratio, a good company behind the product and personal user reviews on the product also order from someone with return policy. Where I bought mine it comes with a policy that replaces it in 2 days if it found to have leakage or dead picels not that I needed.<br>
<br>
I really don't see point getting a crt any more I guess if you are pro gamer (which none of us here in this game are) then maybe then to stratify the paranoia. Thought the performance difference between them is closing fast and is likely the lcd will surpass it or even it self be replaced by even better display may be OLED.<br>
<br>
Been playing with my lcd for some time now and @1680x1050 the game looks stunning the look of the monitor on my desk look great can plug in my ps3 and watch HD video what's not to love about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The human eye can not see 150fps that's my point why would a designer engineer make a LCD monitor that refresh more times than the eye can see it really would seem those extra refreshes become redundant being that you can not benefit from it, a complete waste money for manufacture process stand point but hey if peeps are willing to pay stupid money for it why not make and sell it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

All I can say about this is LMFAO and you have obviously never seen what the night and day difference looks like between the two. The fact you stated about lCD not refreshing every pixel everytime is in fact one of their biggest downfalls when it comes to gaming.<br>
<br>
If you looked back at a picture I posted awhile back of my personal setup you saw a 24' samsung 1080 i monitor setting next to a Sony fw-900 24" crt. They both are connected to two different pc's and I can and have had dm running on both side by side for comparison, like I said the difference is night and day to my eyes and I will be using the crt. However the LCD is fine for what I'm doing now making this post, but Id never game on it.<br>
 If you really want to see something obvious, try running a game like Grid or some other racing game on that LCD, get your car up to top speed and start crying when you see your LCD tear all over the place. <br>
Bottom line is LCD's are great for just about everything EXCEPT fast paced gaming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I bet you gain absolutely nothing with your CRT, although you think you do.<br>

So, maybe that is important, that you THINK the CRT is giving you an extra kill or something.<br>
I think my point still stands, CRTs and LCDs are COMPLETELY Different technologies and applying this REFRESH nonsense to LCDs is nonsense.<br>

I have a Gateway 24 1080 and its gorgeous and plenty fast for gaming.<br>

This phrase would be key and most likely explains your opinion on the matter. <br>

Not trying to be rude or downplay the Gateway monitor, I'm sure it looks nice and performs well for a LCD, it is just not going to perform like a CRT when it comes to gaming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">For the longest time I used a 19" CRT @ 75 Hz that had been slowly crapping out.  Now I game on a BenQ G2400WD.  I would've gone with another CRT except that I'm tired of lugging a decently large CRT to Quakecon every year.    <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
<br>
So when I decided to go with an LCD, it had to have low input lag.  I went with the G2400WD, with an average lag about 8 ms.  Going from 75 Hz on my CRT to 60 Hz was kind of a rough adjustment at first, but was still very playable.  (Yes, refresh rate does matter on LCDs - on a 60 Hz panel, each pixel can physically change color only 60 times every second, and never more.  Except for some ancient models, CRTs aren't limited to 60 Hz, nor do CRTs have any human-observable input lag.)<br>
<br>
For kicks, when I bought a HDTV, I hooked my PC up to it and tried to play HL2DM on it...  Pixel response was good, but the input lag was AWFUL, averaging about 35ish ms, I just could not play on it.  That might be alright for slower-paced games or movies, but totally unacceptable for DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think the fact that people typically sit so much closer to their computer monitors than their TVs explains it.  Peoples' peripheral vision is far more sensitive to motion than the area surrounding their direct line of sight.  If you sit close enough to your TV that the image starts intruding into your peripheral vision, 30 Hz doesn't seem quite so smooth anymore.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>SND wrote:</cite>You can be good on a lcd I know a allot a good players that use them im just not totally convinced CRT holds that much of a advantage over LCD.</div></blockquote>

The big CRT advantage is 0 input lag.  Most LCDs have bad lag, where all CRTs have none.  Good response times aren't really useful if the whole display is several frames behind the video signal.<br>

As for the refresh rate I really don't think having a high frequency will make at all the difference as long as the monitor is no less than what your eye can see. I Don't think you will see much LCD screens with more than 60hz even though it is possible to achieve its just that there is little or no benefit from it and costumers couldn't care less only reason why its not a issue compared to crt is that it uses analogue signal and you needed the ability to change the frequency to work smoothly with your system. Where as latest LCD monitors work in digital where refresh rate has not much of a effect on how it performs (you should use the dvi connection btw for the best picture).</div></blockquote>

Heres an idea, 60hz + 300fps, your eye can only see 60 fps, 150hz + 300 fps, your eye can see 150fps, it is much more smoother especially when turning etc.</div></blockquote>

The human eye can not see 150fps that's my point why would a designer engineer make a LCD monitor that refresh more times than the eye can see it really would seem those extra refreshes become redundant being that you can not benefit from it, a complete waste money for manufacture process stand point but hey if peeps are willing to pay stupid money for it why not make and sell it.</div></blockquote>

Well I must be a super human being then because I can tell the difference, my eyes are apparently far superior than anyone elses along with those others who use CRT's that can support very high refresh rates like fatal1ty etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

My Samsung T220 lies about 10-15 ms behind and I believe this is a pretty common value for modern TN-panels.<br>
<br>
Also, a good response time would matter anyway, since they both add up to the overall experience.<br>
<br>
Overall, I think you guys are simplifying the matter at hand. A refresh rate of 120Hz on a LCD almost never means that the whole screen has done a total refresh in 1/120th of a second. On the contrary, there are residual artifacts that will contribute to a different experience. E.g., it takes some additional time for a pixel to switch off, giving you what is perceived as trailing when images move across the screen.<br>
<br>
What I'm trying to say is, a particular refresh rate of a monitor doesn't mean that you will see a new and perfect image each cycle. So in the real world we will need a higher refresh rate than what a theoretical would suggest is needed for a smooth experience. It's almost always more complex than you first think.<br>
<br>
That being said, people apparently are seeing a huge difference between 60Hz and 120Hz LCD's. To the point where they are prepared to abandon their old high-end CRT's.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I did a bit of research since I love to learn how bits of tech worked and from what I gather 120Hz LCD monitor would be better and also I believe some of us have missed interpret in what way it is smoother than 60Hz. Also they should be able to achieve higher frequency because much larger HD tv run around as large as 200Hz and usually the tech from there trickles down to the monitors they make. Also keep in mind LCD and CRT and completely different animals on how frequency effects them in different ways.<br>
<br>
Here an article I picked up <br>
<a href="http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/news/100120-hz-lcd-why-should-you-take-a-look-2007042354.htm" class="postlink">http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/news/100120-h ... 042354.htm</a><br>
mainly to do with HD tvs but it explains it with flash animations also keep in mind these larger LCD they are talking about so response time will be big. For a LCD it is good to go for 2-5ms since that removes some of the ghosting they talked about also I believe this removes tearing effect since tearing is to do with data being buffered on the monitor. <br>
<br>
On 120hz I say they still tinkering with it most manufactures that have made them have not got it working perfectly but <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/samsung-syncmaster-2233rz/4505-3174_7-33499496.html?tag=mncol;txt" class="postlink">http://reviews.cnet.com/lcd-monitors/sa ... =mncol;txt</a> this seem very good 120hz monitor to get if you had the cash.<br>
<br>
I guess if your really fussy about motion then CRT might be worth getting or keeping. But for everyday use and practicability LCD wins reasons why CRT incorporates a shadow mask which restricts the maximum possible resolution to less than attainable on the equivalent-sized LCD panel. A critical issue for High Definition work. Also LCD more stable and accurate display because of fix pixel image production where as CRT are a vacuum technology precision is less obtainable. CRT build pictures by scanning which are know for flicker. LCD no shiny glass for reflections and better colour and contrast definition. It does not take up a ton of space on the desk and looks good as well. <br>
<br>
So I am happy with my LCD it working charm and have seen nothing wrong with it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

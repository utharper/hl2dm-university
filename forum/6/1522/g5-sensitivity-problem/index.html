	<div class="content">The G9 is different than the G5. The G5 does not store settings on flash memory inside the mouse like the G9 does. <br>
I personally use the set point software with my G5 and it works fine. <br>
The key is to do this:<br>
Figure out what sensitivity you like and want to use, set it and make sure the light is on the top sensitivity position.<br>
Assign keystrokes to buttons 3-9 leaving 1 and 2 as left click and right click.<br>
I use keystroke assignments that are far away from keys I normally use such as o,p,[,],\,k,l,;,' ect<br>
So by assigning keystrokes to buttons 8-9 you disable the ability to change sensitivity on the fly.<br>
Game detection you can leave on ( i had it on for a long time, but prolly best left off) or off but if on you need to check keep mouse acceleration, keep mouse speed, keep right /left hand button assignments and leave *unchecked* keep other button assignments.<br>
 Also check set point implementation on the same page. I personally use NO pointer acceleration, leave enable smart move unchecked as well as enable pointer trails unchecked. pointer speed I leave right in the middle of the slider. Under advanced game settings I set my number one DPI as 2000 and number 2-5 dont really matter to me(just let them be whatever but it might not be a bad idea to set them to something very close like 1995,1990,1985 just incase a malfunction happens ingame) as I have it locked on that setting and by assigning the keystrokes to buttons 8-9 that wont ever change. Make sure the sensitivity light is on the top notch on your mouse under the man running before you start setting it up and it will always stay that way. Report rate I have at 500, messed wit setting it at 1000 but don't see a difference. In game I use a sensitivity of 2.5 and I'm really comfortable with these settings.<br>
No software is perfect and once or twice in the last year the sensitivity light moved down from the top notch, not sure what made it happen but the way to fix it is to reboot your computer and as soon as you see the lights come on your mouse you start pressing the number 8 button (sensitivty +) and it will go back. The trick is to do that before the setpoint software can load on your OS and over ride the default mouse programming. Lastly I would not use the set point that came on the CD with your mouse, go to the site and download the newest version.<br>
I have something bound to all 11 possible buttons (via keystrokes saved in my autoexec.cfg) on the mouse, and use everything frequently with no problems.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i hate to revisit this issue.  maybe you have some other suggestions l2k.  my g5 has started acting up within the past 2 weeks.  it's the on-the-fly dpi that seems to be the issue.  and the problem began the very night i updated setpoint to the latest release.<br>
<br>
worked fine with these following settings upon initial setup.  in game detection is off.  mouse sense is 6.  report rate 500.  dpi 2000.  here are the things i've tried so far:<br>
<br>
1.  unchecked setpoint and checked OS mouse operation (didn't fix)<br>
2.  changed 2nd and 3rd dpi settings to 1995 and 1990 (dpi still changed on its own and felt like it reverted back to the dpi settings of 800 and 400)<br>
3.  reassigned m7 and m8 to "do nothing"  (still didn't fix)<br>
4.  removed 2nd and 3rd dpi settings entirely (dpi still changed on its own and felt like it reverted back to the dpi settings of 800 and 400)<br>
5.  uninstalled setpoint and reinstalled the older software version from cd (this reduced how often the dpi changes occurred, but it does still happen)<br>
<br>
at one point last night, the g5 went completely dead.  no buttons at all worked.  a reboot of the pc corrected that, but it still continued switching dpi on its own.  this g5 is only 4 months old, so i'm pretty pissed.<br>
<br>
2 things i'll try tonight are assigning the m7 and m8 buttons to a keystroke, as you suggested.  see if that helps.  as a last resort, i guess i'll have to uninstall setpoint and just use the windows settings.  i really think that would piss me off the most.  whats the point of spending good money on a "gaming mouse" if you have to resort to using the lowest possible dpi setting with your OS operating system?  and i wonder if m4 and m5 will even work???</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Id say that assigning the keystrokes to those keys would fix it unless your using another version of setpoint that is broken. Pretty much all my setting are like yours with the exception of the keystokes on those keys, so try that.<br>
As far as everything going dead, that can be a problem with your usb bus and as you stated a reboot usually fixes that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i was a little surprised to find that the mouse dpi buttons still worked even after setpoint was uninstalled.  makes me wonder if it was completely removed from the system.<br>

i guess i'll buy another g5 and see if that mouse has the same problem.  if no, i'll send this one back to logitech for replacement.  if yes... then i guess it's a software issue and i'm not sure how i'll address it.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

try this with yours.... lift the g5 off the surface and turn it over so you can look at the lense.  when i do that, my mouse changes dpi then dies.  i have to reboot to get it to work again.  maybe thats a feature or something, so im curious if it happens to other g5's.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">here's my latest theory.  the g5 has a very stiff cord.  my keyboard and mouse are sitting in a computer desk drawer.  the mouse cord is routed through a hole in the center of the back wall of the drawer.  while playing hl2dm i need some "slack" for the mouse cord.  the cord winds up forming an upside down U, or an omega symbol.  where the cord attaches to the front of the mouse, the cord is in a permanent 90% angle.  i think that eventually this causes the mouse to malfunction.  seem plausible?  logitechs clean boot and setpoint bullshit certainly isnt fixing the problem.  i'll have to look and see if i can just let the mouse cord route over the back wall of the drawer.  but im concerned the edges would eventually cause the cord to fray.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"><br>

edit:  yeah ghost dog, i thought that too.  i've tried the mouse in every usb port on my box.  and for good measure i also tried the usb ports on my logitech keyoard.  no dice... same problem.  tonight i tried "straightening" the mouse cord at the nose of the mouse... and the dpi switched or the mouse died everytime it tried it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">in the setpoint turn it to os implementation set point implementing is rubbish i always get trouble with it as long as u got the mouse fix installed the os implementation should not give u much trouble for sensitivity. G5s are pretty strong I have abused it for 9 months so far np so far apart from my mouse wheel not working because there was a fur ball blocking the laser trigger for the wheel fixed it by opening it up and cleaning is so i throw away the manufacture guarantee. Also turn off game detection also helps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lets just say a calamity of problems ensued.  i can't get either the new or old os to connect to the internet.  the old one won't recognize the upgrades i've made... the new one recognizes them but needs to access the internet to ugrade the drivers.<br>

so i pay someone to try and fix it, or i buy a new box and cannibalize the old one.  im already out $315 today and 12 hours of my time.  fuck fuck fuck.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sorry this happened! Did you format the old drive or does it not let you access it?<br>
If it is not reformatted, you could install it as a slave and use a Partition manager to move the data off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

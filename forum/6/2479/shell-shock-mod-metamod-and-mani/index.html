	<div class="content">Hello-<br>
<br>
I'm running HL2DM server with the shell shock Mod on the server...But I'm having issues with Mani while running the shell shock mod. First the Mani Beacon, when running the mod doesn't have the rings to it...matter of fact...none of the commands that involve rings, like time bomb, has the rings to them. How do I fix that? Second, the server running the mod lags, without the mod, it doesn't. How do you fix that?..Thank you in advance for help on this.<br>

	<div class="content">Well you may not like the answer, but my recommendation is to remove mani. Unfortunately it is not very well supported for HL2DM and can cause lag I believe. I have no idea how to fix the issues as I stopped using mani some time ago.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Make sure you are using the latest version of Mani for the source engine that runs DM (not the orange box version).  Also I would recommend using Meta Mod Source as the base for Mani.  I have mani running on my 24 slot pub and it does not lag, ever.  There may be a conflict between the Shell Shock Mod and Mani though.  Also if you have alot of plugins, it can bog down the server.  Also if you havent done it in a while, clean out the old logs on the server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Shellshock is not going to be the same as regular HL2DM.  I wouldn't use it if I were you.  It might work for some things, but you'd never know if it was going to be 100% stable.  Unless they release a version that supports shellshock itself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Is windows and $0.00 acceptable if you use an HDD (such as Seagate FTW!!!) that has a hard drive ghosting program that copies your HDD when you install it?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil">  (Completely legit/legal) <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well here is a decent system at what I would call high end with balanced parts, if money is burning a hole in your pocket you can take it up as high as you want with the CPU. Its about 1400 but has maybe 200 in mail in rebates. This is probably close to what I would build now. <br>

	<div class="content">The best thing to do is look up VGA charts. I had a hard time finding a direct comparison but in one benchmark. But these 2 if thought through should paint a clear picture in over all performance SLI gains are never good enough to over come simply spending that extra money on a better card. <br>
<a href="http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics_sli2007.html?modelx=33&amp;model1=1068&amp;model2=864&amp;chart=378" class="postlink">http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics_ ... &amp;chart=378</a><br>
<a href="http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics_2007.html?modelx=33&amp;model1=1057&amp;model2=1058&amp;chart=318" class="postlink">http://www23.tomshardware.com/graphics_ ... &amp;chart=318</a><br>
The 8800 GTS 512 MB (it should be 512 not 640 or 320) is a hot card for the money. Next step down would be the 8800GT 512mb then 3870 512mb, then 3850 512mb. Basically the only reason you should even do SLI or CF is if you have so much money that you want to blow 1000$ on 2 8800 ultras, or you already have an old system and you want to add a card to give it a little boost. <br>
<br>
I could be a good thing to go into more of the differences between these 2 computers presented. I would not do an AMD CPU unless I was building a sub 1000$ computer. Intel simply wins hands down at the high end. <br>
<br>
I also would not buy a raptor hard drive they are good drives and all but the hard drive I listed will beat it with many times the space in many specs except seek time. Raptors are an aging drive. And the money you spend on them could be saved, in a year or so SSDs will come down in price and make the high performance hard drive a thing of the past. Imagine very fast perfectly silent low power consumption storage. Sorry but the old Hard drive is going to be dead in that market. But hard drives still will win in  price per GB of storage. <br>
<br>
I wouldnt take the rosewill PSU I have had them before and it turned out to be a problem in a system. They are a cheap company and it shows. Also for that price I would want a modular PSU and I would not trust their specs. <br>
<br>
Epochs ram is better then mine but more expensive. Not sure if his price is for 4gb or 2 gb, mine is 4gb<br>
<br>
If you want an upgrade path you need to swap my mobo out for an SLI mobo.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

For some reason I've had an aversion towards intel....don't know why but maybe its time to change lol.  I do keep hearing people say the intel beats the pants off AMd in higher performance brackets.  I can't wait until SSD's are cheaper thats really gonna change the face of home computing so fast and silent *drools*.    wow those graphs change everything lol  one 8800 far surpasses two 8600 in SLI.  Gotta love sites like toms hardware.  Well sweet again thanks fearsome for the insight.  Time to do some more research and get back to the drawing board.  That case you chose is sweet, 4 fans over the mobo, 2 exaust, and a blow hole fan, which seems to be pretty standard nowadays.  And its signifigantly chjeaper than the collermaster stackers which are one of the only other cases with 4 fans over the mobo thats ive been able to find.  Is that a fan filter on the bottom of the case? That would be pretty cool to have a bottom intake fan as long as you had a good filter on there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree this is an awesome thread, very interesting to see what people would put together.<br>
<br>
When dual core came out AMD was on top with its processors and they were better than the pentium D's which had a lot of heat issues and were not very fast.<br>
<br>
Then Intel got their but in gear and their act together (they were a bit embarrassed by being outdone by AMD) and came out with better dual cores, the E6600 and the x6800.  These duals, particularly the 6800 blew everything that AMD had out of the water.   <br>
<br>
They then took the same principal as those and made the quads that are out now.   AMD is now playing catch up.<br>
<br>
Intel is looked down upon I think because their processors initially are quite expensive and the Pent Ds were really pretty bad as often happens when new technology comes out.   Also the company has been around a long time, long enough for people to form opinions and become entrenched in that view.<br>
<br>
I built my computer a little over a year ago and its not a budget machine.   Yes I admit I probably spent more than I needed to but I saved over $1500 compared to what a similar machine would have cost from Dell.   I went with top end for just about everything mainly because I am fortunate that I had the money to do it and I was sick and tired of my old slow Pentium 4 machine slowing my gaming down with its 20 fps and the external hard drive I was using to play the game with.  I was going to have a gaming computer or else!<br>
<br>
I purchased the x6800 processor when I built my computer because I had the money to invest in a top end machine.  Yea I probably spent more than I really needed to but I wanted a fast processor that I didnt need to mess around with overclocking and one that would still be in the higher end processors as new ones came out.  I think its still the fastest dual around.  There are many that think quad is overkill for gaming at this point and is more advantageous in video editing. It will be interesting to see what happens when the games start to be designed with multicore processors in mind.<br>
<br>
I also purchased raptors and put them in a raid 0 configuration because I wanted the access speed.  Yes slower drives probably would have been almost as good but again I was hell bent on a top end machine.<br>
<br>
I illustrate all of this so that people thinking of building a computer dont make the same moves (I wont call them mistakes because I dont regret what I bought or spent) I did when they can get something that will do the job for quite a bit less.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm actually thinking about getting a new computer as well. Or rather a second one, so I'm in need of a full set including a monitor. What is a really good gaming monitor these days? Is the one you listed there something you've specifically checked out? The UltraSharp 2007WFP 20-inch Widescreen.<br>
<br>
I remember hearing that most flat panels have an inherent delay before the picture is displayed, not related to the usual response time as measured how long it takes to switch a pixel between black and white. Anyone knows more about this?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
22" inch wide screen LCD.   It has a 2ms response time (you cant buy any monitors with less than this).  Make sure to get the CW not the other model which I have read is made for Samsung by another company the Samsung made model is better.   They were about the same price as I recall.<br>
<br>
If you plan on still using the other computer for gaming I would recommend that you get the same or very similar monitor because even changing the monitor to one thats a different size takes some getting used to for aiming.  If you switch back and forth a lot it could mess with your aim.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If your considering a and LCD, what you'll be looking for in a gaming monitor is as follows.  <br>
<br>
-High native resolution<br>
-High contrast 700-1000.1 (DC 3000.1)<br>
-2ms response rate<br>
-Widescreen (why not?)<br>
<br>
Other than that make sure to comb the reviews regarding models fitting your desired specs to check for inherent model defects like backlight bleeding, bad color matching, or dead pixel problems.  Also make sure you use a DVI-D cable to ensure best quality.  If I were to buy a new monitor for gaming I would probly go with this one:  <br>

<br>
It's a 19" widescreen with the resolution of a 22" widescreen, with great contrast ratio and 2ms response time.  Amazing price too, considering the specs.  <br>
My 2 cents  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Paradox wrote:</cite>Samsung 226cw</div></blockquote>
I have this monitors little brother, the 906bw.  Just the 19" version with a little bit of a backlight bleeding issue, but I don't notice it unless the screen is totally black.  Blasted varying panel models, samgsung screwed the pooch on THAT manufacturing decision lol.  Still a damn good monitor.[/quote]</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">MIDI mixer huh...hmmmm thinking....thinking....thinking.   Been a while since I've done anything with midi, but couldn't you just bypass this and use a piece of software?  Your basically referring to a sound board right, so you can control the imput from multiple external devices?  Lol 5 years pass and I don't know shit anymore geez lol .  Just curious cause it got me to thinking about procducing techno again, a somewhat lost and forgotten dream of mine.  Now that I have a comp again I think I'll start looking into this again.  Thanks for the random source of inspiration lol.  Best kind imo.  Woohoo now I can pour over reviews for music hardware oh boy oh boy oh boy!!  On the software end of things Reason 3.0 and Protools is just about all I'll ever need.<br>

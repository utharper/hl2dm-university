exactly.  sometimes if you update drivers for something, mobo, sound card etc the sound settings for windows can get reset.  i not saying its not the headset, just saying he should plug them into another pc and see if they work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

not necessarily true a lot of ppl have anger issues and are pretty rough on there accessories I treat everything of mine with kid gloves for the most part unless it is a headset but I've only ever had cheapies so its not that bigga deal when I through them away from me in a hurry to take care of something In The Real World some ppl are extremely harsh on there equipment. I need a new mouse myself ive only used 2 in the last 12 years but seagull burns through them like every month or 2 i think</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, this keyboard is less than 3 months old.  Lately, when strafe jumping or bhopping the game swaps over to windows desktop.  Very annoying.  I have the G15 windows key switched off.  I even removed my bind from the control key (because it sticks up slightly higher than i'm used to and i drag my pinky across it).<br>
<br>
I can't reproduce the problem when I try (just pressing the windows key does nothing so it seems the keyboard "off" feature for the windows key is working).  But it happens regularly when I play.  The only thing I notice is that it tends to happen more when my fingers are "flatter" to the keyboard (dragging pinky across the control and windows keys).  If I conciously "arch" my fingers, it rarely happens.  This leads me back to believing there is an issue with the windows key.  But the swap out of the game is to the desktop, not the windows start menu.  It's just like hitting alt_tab.<br>
<br>
Suggestions?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I would try to experiment with key combinations you would definately be pressing during gameplay, because with my PC there are certain key combos you can press to activate hardware managers and hardware information indicators, that does the same thing to me.<br>
<br>
Maybe you'll find out whats causing it this way it may be the PC not the keyboard.<br>
<br>
But worst case scenario, if it is broken logitech will replace it fast and free.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i thought about the sticky keys keefy.  but i didnt know how to disable that feature.  thanks!<br>
<br>
and no macros jelly.  no clue how to use that feature.<br>
<br>
this is stupid, but i think i fixed it.  i checked for updates using the included update feature with the profiler software.  it told me no updates.  but i checked the logitech website and DID find an update.  downloaded that and the problem seems to have disappeared.<br>
<br>
thanks for the suggestions folks!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

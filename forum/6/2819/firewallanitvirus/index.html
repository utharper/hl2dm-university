At the end of the day its the user that lets the viruses in by downloading "hacks", "codecs" to watch pr0n, clicking the enlarge your penfifteen ads etc,  also certain viruses are designed to attack certain AV, e.g when I was using Norton 2003 I was sent a picture file that ended in .exe  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  I know now but then I was noobie so accepted and my AV (norton) knew there was a virus but could do fack all about it, anyway after 4 hours messing around asking people I found out I had to downlaod the actual virus client itself which was prorat1.8  and dissable the "local server". Prorat is suposed to be a remote administration tool so the site said.<br>
<br>
I use my routers hardware firewall and the XP firewall.<br>
I recomend Nod32, I have been using it for 3 years now and its saved me a few times from those pesky pr0n sites and dodgy keygens from dodgy torrents.  I have never used Esmart security so cannot comment on it but it does include Nod32 in the package which I know is great.<br>
<br>
Link to Esmart security 30 day free trial.<br>
<a href="http://www.eset.com/download/free_trial_download_int.php" class="postlink">http://www.eset.com/download/free_trial ... ad_int.php</a><br>
You need to get your logon details so you can downlaod the trial and  update through the 30 days.<br>

What kind of experience do you have with computers? I don't think you are knowledgeable enough to make a worthwhile contribution to this topic.<br>
<br>
Anti virus programs work. Your average user is probably running an out of date Norton that came installed with their computer. This obviously will not help at all. Use Nod32, proven to be one of top anti virus programs in many tests, and you should be okay. Avoiding shady websites and obvious "this is a virus".exe files helps too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I use a program made by Computer Associates, a company known for its software to protect business machines and servers.  They made a PC version of their antivirus.  I have been using it for two years.  Granted I try to stay away from suspicious sites, but I do download maps from alot of different places.  Not only does the CA program take less resources that that crap Norton, but I have not had one problem with a virus, and if it does fail, the company has quaranteed replacement of whatever was damaged if it cant be fixed due to the virus, spyware, etc.  It even considers IRC flood to be a virus and warns about it.  You set the permissions for which programs you want to access the net.  IMO its a great program and I highly recommend it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I may be more fortunate in the fact that I use some 4 year old piece o shat p4 2.5 ghz with 1 gb ram and a ati 9800 pro for my everyday internet use while my game rig does nothing but game. The thing is though that even my POS has not had a virus because I dont do stupid shiat with it either. If you want to do stupid shait get your self a free(easy to find these days) P3 or P4 that is running a hacked version of xp pro, teach yourself how to reformat on a regular basis and download anything and everything your heart desires, just keep your personal info and banking on the SAFE machine.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I tend to like three levels of security firewall, av, anti-spyware  <br>
<br>
Make sure you get the good package with all three because some security programs such as Mcafee that came with my laptop slows down your system. AVG is a good company provide a decent package that does not slow shit down it is pretty easy to use with web browser plugin for firefox.<br>
<br>
Reason why why I prefer all the firewall gives me control of what programs can access the net also it blocks out back doors to my system. Anti-virus is the last line defense if it does not pick it up your screwed and anti-spyware well three years ago I has a program that was recognized by the av but it just did not do anything to it so did a scan with anti-virus found a program got rid of it did a second scan with av and it pick up like 5 more programs and clean it all up so nice to have all three. But it no guarantee being careful where you surf and what you download is the best security.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">All you guys saying "I don't have any viruses" without an anti-virus, how exactly do you know? That's the entire purpose of a virus. It infects your system without your knowledge and can possibly steal personal information and whatever it wants. You don't know you have a virus until it's too late. Nod32 uses hardly any resources and with Eset Smart Security's firewall, it warns you everytime a program attempts to make an internet connection (inbound and outbound, in interactive mode). Better safe than sorry.<br>

The first version of the CA antivirus software I got was free as a promotion in 2007 from Tigerdirect.   I paid $29 to upgrade it in 2008.  If it costs me about $30 a year to keep it up to date I consider it money well spent to prevent the aggravation of dealing with a virus not to mention the time it would take away from being able to play.

Maybe keep your useless opinion to yourself, ass.<br>

There is also another alternative to a running AV process and that is Pandascan online. The only drawback is real infections infect your internet processes <br>
You can also use What's Running and Hijack This to see whats going on.<br>

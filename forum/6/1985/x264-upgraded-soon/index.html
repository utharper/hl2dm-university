	<div class="content">Ok so i never tought such a weird situation would happen to me, here it goes.<br>
<br>
So my gf takes a student language program in english immersion in toronto for a month, i go see her there.<br>
<br>
There i meet a bunch of people, in that bunch there's a dude from europe. Then we talk about what we do respectively and he introduced himself as a "codec designer"<br>
<br>
I'm like no shit m8, i did some exports bla bla, i think x264 is great stuff.<br>
<br>
He looks at me with a smile and he's like, damn i never tought someone that would know about codecs here! and then he keeps talking to me about very technical stuff that i totally couldn't understand but i didn't made it look that confusing so he'd keep talking so i could learn a bit more XD<br>
<br>
And then he mentions that he found a way to improve x264 through G264 (or H264?) and it's actually patent pending.<br>
<br>
The guy basically improved the codec in some way and as soon he has the patent he'll release it /sell it / whatever-it<br>
<br>
I tought the idea might interest some of yall, check it out!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">x264 is so amazing that the only way I see it becoming better is by making an even smaller impact on cpu usage. Or if made it into a standard supported by hardware (which is basically the same thing).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

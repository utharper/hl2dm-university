	<div class="content">Hi all, been having problems setting up the map decals in mani...<br>
please help <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What i've done.....</strong><br>
I have created a vmt/vtf, uploaded it to 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>/hl2mp/materials/decals/custom/ghost
</div></blockquote>

added them to the decallist.txt
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>	"ghost_recruit_ad"		"decals/custom/ghost/ghost_recruit_ad"<br>

		"ghost_recruit_ad.vft"	"materials/decals/custom/ghost/ghost_recruit_ad.vtf"
</div></blockquote>

Managed to spray it onto a wall using ma_decal ghost_recruit_ad<br>
<br>
placed the co-ordinates in the mapadverts.txt 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>// map name<br>
<br>
	"dm_lockdown"<br>
	{<br>
		// Name of the decals to use (see decallist.txt file)<br>

<br>
			"y" "4799.96875"<br>
<br>
			"z" "150.55151"</div></blockquote>

edited the mani_server.cfg
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>	mani_map_adverts 1</div></blockquote>

I even edited the pure_server_whitelist.txt
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>	materials\decals\custom\ghost\... 	allow_from_disk</div></blockquote>

and added them to the downloads.txt
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>"ghost_recruit_ad"	"materials/decals/custom/ghost/ghost_recruit_ad.vmt"
</div></blockquote>

restarted the server, changed maps, still nothing.....<br>

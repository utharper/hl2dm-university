	<div class="content">I was having trouble with my computer where it wouldn't turn on. I didn't want to hoard you guys with anymore of my problems so I didn't post here. But essentially, I pressed the power button and nothing happened.<br>
<br>
The power supply in my case went out. <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811240002" class="postlink">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... 6811240002</a> <br>
<br>
We made sure it was a faulty power supply before I bought the new one by checking it with another power supply and using a amp or watt calculator that my dad has to confirm.<br>
<br>
I went to the newegg watt calculator <a href="http://educations.newegg.com/tool/psucalc/index.html" class="postlink">http://educations.newegg.com/tool/psucalc/index.html</a> and entered in all my info. It suggested some psu's. I went with this one. <br>

<br>
Two fans and two 12v rails.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, you guys were right. I wanted to wait for the power supply in the case to go out before I bought a new one though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

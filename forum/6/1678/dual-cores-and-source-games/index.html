	<div class="content">IF some of you dualCore users had this problem, you probablynoticed some lag when launching games such as portal,hl2, tf2, Gmod etc...<br>
<br>
This issue makes you lag as if you were ingame playing with 1-3 FPS. bad lag.<br>
<br>
It can be fixed by hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL and killing the <br>
<br>
nSvcAppFlt.exe<br>
<br>
 process before launching your game. I don't know exactly what AppFlt does but stopping it before yourun a game fixes the lag some might get with the games mentionned above. <br>
<br>
<br>
Hope it helped some of you out there. It helped me a ton.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Intermittently this process takes around 50% of CPU time. When this happens Internet Explorer won't respond and Informatica's PowerCenter client program Designer gives this message: "This action cannot be completed because the other program is busy. Choose 'Switch To' to activate the busy program and correct the problem."<br>

EDIT: I have deleted the Nvidia Forceware Network Access program and it took at least 4 other processes with it. Was aware of a problem with this app but was afraid to delete because it is Forceware.  It isnt related to your basic Forceware ethernet/network adapter,  internet works fine without this app.<br>
<br>
Its probably the like the whole HP syndrome: It dumps tons of craptastic needless junk dungware onto your PC, making it unusable!  G** Damn i hate HP!<br>
<br>
Anyhow, one of the problems i had was lack of network access when coming out of Standby/S3 mode, which i use to conserve. I would have to disable/re-enable the adapter.  I will post if deleting the app has helped.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Some of the other processes that were deleted were probably part of Nvidia Ntune, which is useless for O/Cing anyways and i have diagnostics anyways, so goodbye to more unneeded processes running in memory.<br>
Ntune DID have a network diagnostic and may have used the process above.<br>
<br>
Don't think Dual Core is really a problem with much of anything lately.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Opened a ticket with Razer, we'll see what happens.  But I'll be paying attention to this thread.  I really loved the feel of the DeathAdder, but not sure I can recommend it based on durability.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Mx518 is a cheaper/shittier version of the G5...crappy grip, no weights and gets dirty easily..also the right click on mine sticks...waste of 40 bucks...im loving the g5 though..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have a G9 while not as sensitive as the lates razer mouse it doesnt have the problem it has like cursor moving for no reason i always hear  a clan memeber complaining at least once every couple of games. Although i believe  there is a beta firmware to address this.<br>
The weights i can live without.<br>
I like the onboard memory just install drivers once setup mouse then unistall them.  (you cannot adjust polling rate from default with no drivers)<br>
The look is not everyones cup of tea (yes i drink tea i am british) but you didnt buy it for its looks at least i didnt it feels abit strange if used to 518 or g5 as it is drastically different in shape but you soon get used to it.<br>
The feet on the G9 a way more superior than the 518 or g5 they glide nicer on my mat (func 1030) there is lots more surface area and also they look thicker to begin with so should last longer depending on your mouse surface.<br>
Teh mouse wheel is awsome, while probably no us in game it does make browsing long web pages very easy, quick and silent.<br>
LED show you what snes the mouse is on and also what profile you are using (by its colour) another useful feature. which lacks on the 518 not sure about g5 i never had 1.<br>
<br>
Overall i like my G9 it is much better than a 518 but i feel you will not like the price they can be expensive.<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
<br>
PS<br>
as for some saying the 518 gets dirty easy, it is only as dirty as your hands are.  The reason I bought my 518 was at the time the G5 had only 1 thumb button, I chose extra button over extra dpi and crappy weights any day.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I am curious about the lechasis, looks like it could go either way ergonomically.<br>
But yea, i have a G9 also, its way way better then the G5 or mx518, dpi makes a big diff imo, and turning off accel, smoothing an all that, makes for a super smooth ride.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They are hands down three of the most widely used mice out there.  I stand by the Death Adder, great specs for a great price, what more could you ask for.

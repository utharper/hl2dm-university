	<div class="content">I've just confirmed that any time I try to DL a map from an sv_downloadurl address in-game, the process fails with the "missing maps" error. I thought it may have just been the server, but I've tried any number of times now at various places, they all fail. Strangely the progress bar shows all the files going through, .ain and all, but then it bails. I have cl_allowdownload 1...i don't get what I'm missing?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well it's end-user-error I've found, I had IE's LAN connection proxies set to 0.0.0.0. port 80,as a temp fix for a trojan hijacking Ive been fighting. Setting that to Automatic allows the map download to finish properly. Possibly server OS has to do with it, I know mine is Linux, can't say about the others.<br>
<br>
Kinda lame that Steam is so closely integrated with IE, with so much malware designed for that browser</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have a fast DL.  It and all the game servers (about 6 servers currently) it is redirecting for are linux.  So I doubt it is a linux problem.<br>
<br>
Were the maps DLing before or is this a new install?<br>
<br>
If this is a new install, the directory structure on the fast DL has to match the directory structure on the game server EXACTLY or you will get that error.  You also must have the sound and materials folders as well as whatever has to be in those from any or all of the maps or you can get that error.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I just bought a logitech g5 and i'm having problems with it ingame. When i try to do a quick 180 it gets stuck halfway through my turn. I've googled this and it seems like i'm no the only one that has had this problem. Does anyone know if there is a way to fix this, it's very annoying.<br>
<br>
I'm using 2000dpi with 0.75sensitivity and i've tried it with and without drivers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I added it to the site and will try it next time I am in game.<br>

Having only 1 side button was the  reason i didn't buy a G5, instead i bought an MX518.  Now Logitech make a two side button version of the G5 so when my 518 left and right click buttons started to deteriorate i was all for buying 1 until i heard of the G9 which is my current mouse.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yea thats what i love about the g5 it sits so well in my hand and is pretty sturdy and it added weightiness gives be good feed back on my aim. I heard allot of guys razors break in the first 4months. Im sticking with mine until it breaks had it for allmost a year no problems apart from Logitech crappy driver issues that i had to fix when i got it.<br>

Odd...I thought the mx518 is too small (lots of people say it's huge in reviews, and I have small hands..) and I think it's actually pretty heavy...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You think the G5 is expensive try the G9 that is £70 (from logitech site) which is about $140  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked">  of coure i ddint buy from logitech.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

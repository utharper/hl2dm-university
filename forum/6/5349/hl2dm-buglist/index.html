<ul>
<li>Weapons / items aren't able to stay named after respawn<br>
<br>
Weapons items aren't able to teleport<br>
<br>
There is a bug when a player is walking on the seam between a floor and wall they jitter<br>
<br>
An xbow shot hitting Weapons/Item - should pass through them<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Func_door</em> collision issue - player can pass through brush<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Func_button</em> lock/unlock bug - many time a mapper setting a fucn_button to lock isn't working ingame.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Trigger_dissolve</em> - endless sound loop<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Point_template</em> able to operate independently without the need for a weapon_&lt;weapontype&gt; present (will enable mappers to spawn weapons on demand rather than rely on weapon spawns if they so wish)<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Game_player_equip</em> entity is bugged where it will work the first few times a player triggers it then it breaks (see dm_biohazard)<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Info_item_smg_grenade</em> explodes above item/weapon/player spawn points<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Info_item_crossbow_ammo</em> is "rolling away" after first respawn<br>
<br>
All Items/weapons/props having trouble spawning when placed on a surface other than world geometry brush<br>
<br>
Map built on the middle of the grid in hammer causes weird issues - usually multiple spawns of the same weapons.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Weapon_RPG</em> going into stasis bug<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Weapon_RPG</em> endless sound loop bug<br>
<br>
In the OB port players can no longer use props to jump off of<br>

<em class="text-italics">Ambient_generic</em> not playing after <em class="text-italics">restartgame</em> bug<br>
<br>
func_areaportal bugging out after <em class="text-italics">restartgame</em> bug<br>
<br>
Too many vertex format changes in frame, whole world not rendered - console error is present since the port (Client gets this error filling console and game runs like a slideshow when they move, not when standing still using mouse look)<br>
<br>
Crouch/sprint delay - It is a bug with sprinting after you leave a crouch. Stop crouching / press sprint and it makes the sprint noise but dosn't increase your speed. <br>
<br>
Shotgun reload bug is still present (was also in the ep1 version) - If you reload the shotgun, switch to another weapon and then switch back to shotgun the reload animation glitches</li>

<br>
Youre assuming that it is something that is even toggleable.   IMO you give people the option to turn it off and you will find most pubs (particularly pubs belonging to newer players) will have it turned off and will not give players on that server the opportunity to be exposed to it and to even have the desire to learn.  If we want to see it continue in the game then new players need to see it in action and be given the opportunity to inquire and learn it.  Having it as a toggleable option may not be something this community would like to see given the potential consequences.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I DO like the idea of having bunnyhopping as an achievement though. Might be a really good way to get people more into the game. Achievements in general will help that.<br>
<br>
As for bugs, it would be nice to not die when tripping over a radiator. Though I'll admit it adds a certain flavor to the game.<br>
<br>
One bug I DONT like is the shotty 'jam' when reloading. <br>
<br>
Thats all I can think of at the moment.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What he means is that if you shoot 5 out of 6 mag rounds then switch off to the shotty for a few minutes the mag is fully reloaded again. This goes for every weapon. its different for each weapon and I remember reading about it somewhere here. Personally I dont think thats an issue since the aim of this game is not realism.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

</div></blockquote>

Repectfully, I dont think anyone here gives a rats ass about what CSS or any other game has.  This is HL2DM and Bhop is part of what makes HL2DM what it is.   Just because its toggleable in CSS doesnt mean we have to make it toggled in HL2DM.   There is a reason why people continue to play HL2DM.  Remove bhop or allow it to be removed by enough noob server owners and we all might as well switch to CSS or COD because no one will want to learn it anymore.   <br>
<br>
However making it some kind of achievement might not be so bad an idea, at least that might put an end to the "OMG its a hax" syndrome.  Honestly though Im not sure how that would work because its not exactly a weapon or an upgrade you can just turn on with kills, ranks, points.  Unless you completely change the game code to make the game not recoginze the keys and key strokes that make bhop possible, but that again might be a means to eliminate it altogether.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is what i mean pretty much.<br>
<br>
1. Fire magnum until empty<br>
2. switch to SMG<br>
3. pickup magnum ammo or magnum gun<br>
Works with other weapons also e.g crossbow and RPG<br>

	<div class="content">Good evening,<br>
<br>
I have been running a SRCDS for the last few years and now today I restarted my server and it gets stuck at:<br>
<br>
Network:  IP 192.168...   mode MP, dedicated Yes, ports 27015 SV / 27005 CL<br>
<br>
That's as far as it gets and never actually starts completely.<br>
I've been told before that I need to add -ip &lt;outside IP address&gt; to my command line but I've been running it this way for the last few years with no problems, plus, it complains about a missing UDP port when I put that line in with my outside IP address.  I'm running through a router and everything is setup properly.  My server has been running great for the last couple years and now this has happened.  Any suggestions?  Also, server files are all up to date.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
<br>

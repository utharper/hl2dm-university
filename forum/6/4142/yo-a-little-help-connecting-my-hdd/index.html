Any ideas of what could be?<br>

good question, after reading what he wrote was thinking the exact same thing.<br>
<br>
assuming that your system wont power up at all, meaning nothing powers up(fans, lights, etc) its almost a sure thing its the PSU.  to test this, unplug all hard ware,  unplug, case fans (NOT THE HEAT SINK FAN&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;AGAIN&lt; NOT THE HEATSINK FAN)  dvd drive power, if you are populating all slots of RAM remove a couple, if you have onboard video, use that and unplug power to your vid card if your card has plugs for power, if not remove the card completely.  then power up.  if still no response then you have a HDD issue, and not quite sure what it is. possibly a electicity issue with the drive itself shorting out your power flow.  although the pc does opperate on pulses (DC) its still a circuit.  i doubt that is the issue but, you never know.  btw why did you buy a 160gig HD?  also is the drive sata?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Well, its most likely the Power Supply not being able to give out enough juice as chem said, but it could also be a shot circuit on the motherboard for that connector. Try using a different port and see if it still boots if possible.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
 Are you using a dedicated wire from the power supply that is not connected to anything else (for example no splitter (Y)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i tried connecting the HDD on different sata ports, but still nothing :S. it only happens with this HDD, even if i connect my 320 gb disk, no problem, the pc turns on.<br>
<br>
the only thing i have to do is connect the disk to another comp...i'll try that on this days.<br>

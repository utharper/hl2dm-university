<br>
Z makes a good point. I would recommend AT LEAST  a 19". I upgraded from a 15" LCD to a 20.1 Sceptre Widescreen LCD. I love it and it was cheap. <br>
Got it for 169.99.<br>

	<div class="content">Do you have a choice? Honestly there are very few 4:3 aspect ratio panels out now and most are more expensive because you get less area out of a wide screen of the same size so the LCD panel manufacturers can sell wide screen monitors cheaper and eventually just wanted to get rid of 4:3s<br>
<br>
As far as games are concerned for HL2DM anyway wide screen is better as you will see more around you since you effectively have a wider FOV. <br>
For most normal activities though the normal screens gave you more pixels to work with. The best price / performance are 22" wide screens now. You can get them for 200$ and unlike the larger resolution 24" monitors you do not need as much graphics power to run them at native resolution.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote><div><cite>Epoch wrote:</cite>If your considering a and LCD, what you'll be looking for in a gaming monitor is as follows.  <br>
<br>
-High native resolution<br>
-High contrast 700-1000.1 (DC 3000.1)<br>
-2ms response rate<br>
-Widescreen (why not?)<br>
<br>
Other than that make sure to comb the reviews regarding models fitting your desired specs to check for inherent model defects like backlight bleeding, bad color matching, or dead pixel problems.  Also make sure you use a DVI-D cable to ensure best quality.  If I were to buy a new monitor for gaming I would probly go with this one:  <br>

<br>
It's a 19" widescreen with the resolution of a 22" widescreen, with great contrast ratio and 2ms response time.  Amazing price too, considering the specs.  <br>
My 2 cents  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">
</div></blockquote>

Theres no reason not to go widescreen anymore!:D  My best advice advice to you while your checking out different LCD's is DO YOUR RESEARCH!!!  Can't stress that enough.  If you do your research you'll be happy with the FIRST product you buy instead of condemning yourself to the shipping and hanling nightmare of trial and error lol.  Unless you buy it retail, then it doesn't matter lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, I'm using a 20inch Samsung SyncMaster 204B.<br>

I got it almost 2 years ago and last time I checked they don't have it on Newegg anymore although I got it from CompUSA. <br>

	<div class="content">yeah I don't think the 20" panels had that problem for some reason, they may not have been naufactured in china.  Its really not a problem for me, but I notice a ton of light ruining my beautiful blacks around the edges of the monitor when the screen is VERY dark, if not completely black.  But I mostly play games and surf the web so its either light screens or I'm trying so hard to kill people thaty I don't notice the bleeding at all.  A dead pixel would be amuch bigger deal for me lol.  I hate those little buggers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

DUDE!!  Seriously lose the additude!  From what you said you did not know why newegg stopped selling that particular samsung model.  He was simply providing you with the reason....newegg stopped selling my samsung monitor aswell, for the exact same reason.  Computer technology becomes obsolete so fast that companies like newegg are constantly going to be renewing their inventories to keep up with the times.  Theres no reaosn to get all huffy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

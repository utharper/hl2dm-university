	<div class="content">hello.  I am currently running 2 BFG 9600 gt oc 512 mb cards.  I am curious as to what your recommendations are for setting them up?  I enabled SLI in the control panel.  It gives me a few options as well for determining the way SLI works, for example<br>
<br>
nvidia recommended (all it says), force split screen, force alternate frame 1, force alternate frames 2.   I havent really seen an increase in anything with alternating between these.  When I enable the SLI markers in the control panel, when Im playing games and its on force split screen, I get a neon greeen line through the middle of the screen.  But in reality it goes up and down, but usually down.  signifying that the 2nd card isnt really rendering half the screen.  this is on 1270 x 780 or something like that.  the one right abouve 800x600.  <br>
<br>
I also get a weird light flashing thing when playing bioshock, and crysis seems to run fine, no worse than before.  dont know how to test fps in that game.  in hl2dm I got a 30-60 fps increase thats about it.  I get pretty much 300 on most maps, but I feel that something is not right.  any advice?  anyway to force sli for this game in console?  <br>
<br>
i enabled auto detect in bios, and ive also tryed dual video card in bios as well.  I think SLI may be a rip off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">SLI works great, mainly its for people who run high resolutions or those looking to pick up a few extra FPS. I run a 24' lcd at 1920x1200 with 2 8800 GT's and at this resolution it gives me about 50-75 more fps vs just running one card. I usually get around 150-250 fps depending on the map and what is going on. In games like crysis it made a huge difference for me, but Im also running a 3 year old dual core rig at this point.<br>
 As far as the settings go all you need to do is enable SLI in the Nvidia control panel and thats it, the default nvidia SLI config is the preferred option. Once enabled it is working all the time and there is nothing you need to do in game or otherwise. Some motherboards may require you to do certain things like use another power connector or use a jumper ect, refer to your mobo's manual to find out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well my mothorboard came with a bridge connector, if thats the right term.  I also read about some having jumper connections.  my manual doesnt really state if I need to use the jumpers or the bridge connector.  I looked for the jumpers and I found quite of few of them, but not that were obviously labeled SLI.  So I use the connector.  I will changed the panel back to recommended.  <br>
<br>
So is it safe to say since Im using a 19 inch CRT at a lower res that SLI wouldnt do as much for me?  I run dual core AMD 64x2 6000+ at 3.1 each, they overclock real nice like to. I got them up to 3.7 without any noticable heat increase with this mobo!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I wouldn't say that at all, I think you may not see the benefits all the time but when you need it, its there and helps. Maps that are prone to low fps in certain areas for instance if you have a 4 man brawl going on there with explosions going off ect SLI can really help you out providing more fps. SLI is also going to allow you to turn up your details, run AA ect. and not take a big hit for having that stuff up on high or enabled.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nope, lycosa is cheaper than tarantula. Same as deathadder is cheaper than copperhead.

Well the tarantula is supposed to have anti-ghosting...which I guess must solve it. Correct me if I'm wrong.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@Fearsome- That is correct, the WASD and other keys around them are anti-ghosting.  So i dunno if an esdf movement person would be able to have their wep binds to the right of their movement buttons be anti-ghosting.  I can't remember which keys specificly are anti-ghosting, I'll post when I get home and have a chance to look at the info that came with the board.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Exactly the same as me, I use ESDF for movement and my E key only works half the time unless I press it really hard...it's so effin annoying, I'm gonna complain about it...I think (hope) the Saitek comes with a 2 year warranty.<br>

I think there is a program out there which shows you how many keys are responsive when you press many of them.<br>
Maybe you can try that with your keyboard (while pressing stuff like any esdf player would). =]</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Looking at the specifications, you can soon see where the differences are between this keyboard and the Tarantula. With the Tarantula every key had the anti-ghosting facility, which means that when you press multiple buttons at once, you don’t get a random key being sent to your PC. With the Lycosa, while you’d expect the entire board to have this feature, it’s only the WASD cluster which is a little vague. Does it mean that you can press all of the WASD buttons at once or does it mean that you can press other keys AND all the WASD buttons? The ability to press all the WASD keys at once is pretty much useless, as according to Razer’s own evidence, a generic board can have 3 buttons pressed at once. When have you ever wanted to go backwards, forwards, left and right at the same time? It sounds like this ‘anti-ghosting’ feature is a PR point rather than something that’ll help in your day-to-day gaming.</div></blockquote>

Also I tested the Saitek using a key press test and it's the same as a standard keyboard... shite!<br>

Nice find with the keybaord testing app Jelly, having stuff like that linked on the site is a handy resource. Its weird though I don't really know if ghosting is really all that much of an issue, I used a stock keyboard to play this gme for the first year and a half that I played and never noticed any problems with ghosting.  So I mean the lycosas' anti-ghosting feature even though its limited would be a plus.  I dunno its so damn shiny, just buy it, it SHINES! Mmmm pretty lights and colors and mmmmmmmmmm shiny.<br>
<br>
@ Reviewer "When have you ever wanted to go backwards, forwards, left and right at the same time?"  <br>
I read this review when I was checking out the Lycosa, then and now my response is the same.  Are you fucking retarded!?  Its not about JUST the wasd you fucktard the anti-ghosting encompasses other keys which actually whould be beneficial to press along with W+D and W+A+ctrl+wep.  I'm sorry but that section and a couple other sections of that review just made me wanna yell, "WTF are smoking man, fuck."  Dunno why but that dude gets me all hot and bothered.  If your a reviewer you really can't provide people with misleading information, its just fucked up.

@ Onti  Ok I finally tested it and I was able to press a total of 6 keys at a time with all of the essential keys you would need to press in game.    Except tab, that was the only one that did not register in the area of the esdf keys.  So even though they aren't listed as anti-ghosting they were registering after 6 keys were being pressed, the seventh would not register.  So I dunno about razers picture because the program says otherwise.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I did some in game testing with the esdf cfg and try as I might I wasn't able to physically press enough keys to where any were not registering.  You would need some double jointed fingers to press enough buttons to experience any ghosting lol.  I had weps bound to r, g, v, b and t and all of them worked while holding 4 other keys.  I even tried holding e+f, ctr, bouncing with space, and timing my wep chages on r,f,c,v, and t wep binds to see if you would be able to switch while bhopping.

And alt and shift now stick a little so they don't reset after a press as fast as they should.  I didn't confront him last night when I noticed it cause Iw as in a bad mood and I figured I might start flipping out.  I told him when I finally caved and started letting him use my comp that i REALLY didn't want to, and that he would need to keep everything, cleaner than I left it....well the shit has officially hit the fan.  I can't open it up to clean it because it will probly void my warranty, but then they also won't replace it for spill damage.  So i guess I have to try and get a straight answer out of him...oi this is the situation I wanted to avoid by being a nazi and not let ANYONE even touch my comp.  *sigh* I knew I should have been an asshole, geez this is what you get for being nice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

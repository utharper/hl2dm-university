Notoriously know for being a good mouse but.... also 1 of the easiest to short out/break tons of ppl with doa or quick kills for the 518 while many others have it long lasting but logi is really good on warranties <strong class="text-strong">usually</strong> so if they give you a lemon 1-4 times inquire bout an upgrade.  As for Steelseries idk much bout them other than there brand name is almost on par with there mice products from what I've read while I have a razer abyssus good tracking but &lt;stewie griffin voice&gt;my god man&lt;/stewie&gt; the mouse buttons are so freaking sensitive I got heavy hands but if I'm watching a vid and a rest unintentionally its a right click on the app or screen, I have had a couple of issues with magnum firing while just moving the mouse any 1 else have these issues with razer? <br>
<br>
tons of ppl swear by the 518 though so its a got a rep but always depends on personal preference<br>
<br>
I myself would like a mouse with better ergo mines basically normal mouse with gaming grade laser and buttons but my hands give me a big clearance away from the mouse so any recommendations out there? sry for the hijack btw but at least i gave some input too <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

mx518 is reliable, and a solid mouse (Unlike that POS company called Razer that has put out a new mouse every 4-6 months only to be plagued with the same old problems).  mx518 with its 1800 DPI is more than enough for me.  What I really want is a mouse that doesn't fuck up.  So far the mx518 has never failed me, why "upgrade?"  If you want to call it that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">@ Rejected: The MX518 is and excellent mouse (I never said it wasnt).  Ive owned a few of them and they are good.  However they are outdated in terms of the fact that you can get mice with much higher DPI and better sensitivity.    Lastly, the MX518s are optical mice, not lazer mice.  Most gamers and gaming mice reviews will tell you that lazer mice track better and with more accuracy than optical mice.  I personally also like the G5s and G500 for the fact you can add weights to them, for me the feel of a weighted mouse is better than a non-weighted one.  Non weighted seems too light for me, but thats just me.   On another note, I didnt like the feel of the G9s so never bought one of those.  <br>
<br>
@ Impala:  Ive owned 4 G5s never ever had a problem with any one of them other than the fact that I wear them out from use.  Ive had that many so I can carry one in my laptop bag without having to disconnect the one from the computer and I like to have a spare around.   I broke the mouse wheel on one trying to knife someone in a really intense BFBC2 game.   Also, I never had to do a firmware update but I dont use the software for them anyway.   I tried a Razor mouse once and I dont like the feel of them.<br>
<br>
@ ?  I looked at some of the newer Steel Series mice at a video game show and except for the fact that they dont have weight customization, they seem like excellent mice.  If they would have had weights, I would have bought one to try.  They have also gotten some good reviews by some video game mags.<br>
<br>
I think that choice of mouse really boils down to personal preference.  If you like the feel of it, go with that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for the prompt responses.<br>
<br>
I've been using my MX400 for, hell, probably 2 years by now, so I'm pretty bloody used to the shape of it.  Pretty sure the 518 is exactly identical in shape and size<br>
<br>
The one thing that's putting me off Steelseries a bit is that, although the specs are right and I've heard countless tales of their miraculous awesomeness, their mice looks like fuckin' 10$ microsoft things.  They just <em class="text-italics">look</em> unbearably cheap, and it's hard to imagine them being as good as I know they actually are.<br>
<br>
I would look into a Logitech G5, but I've heard stories of reliability issues; not sure how exaggerated some of them may be.<br>
<br>
I've got a fair chunk of extra cash that I won't be needing for university this year (got enough scholarships) that I don't really have a budget limit for my new mouse.<br>
<br>
Everyone I've spoken to that has a Razer swears by it, but some of them strike me as fanboys and I'm not sure what their opinion is really worth.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, basically what I'm looking for is a wired mouse with respectable DPI and response time, obviously 2 buttons and a scroll wheel, plus I like side buttons, preferably on the thumb side.  It also has to be reputably reliable.  Does anyone else have a product that they care to promote that hasn't been mentioned yet?<br>
<br>
Another issue, I suppose, is that the only stores around here I can actually find a reasonable selection of mice at are Staples and Futureshop, so if i want a Steelseries or something else less "mainstream" I'll have to order online, and I've gotten seriously pissed off with ordering PC shit online and getting it DOA<br>
<br>
Um, any questions?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Lemme jump in as a rep for the Razer mouse.<br>
<br>
I owned a 518 for ages, still have it for my laptop.<br>
<br>
But for my recently upgraded desktop I wanted to splurge a little and get a Razer mouse. So I looked around until I saw the Imperator. It had a different shape than all the other razer mice I've seen so I decided to try it. This felt like a more ergo 518, it had a nice weight to it and the feet cover a nice wide area so it stays flat on whatever surface you have it on. I liked that the side buttons were also adjustable to whatever works best. Great sensor, almost too much actually. The best way I can describe the Imperator is: Basically a wired Mamba.<br>
<br>
My MX 518 served me well, and continues to do so, for many years but when I used this one I was instantly satisfied with the upgrade. <br>

Ive read many more recent reviews that say lazer mice are better for FPS gaming than optical, Ive also read comments by some people (regular consumers not reviewers) that there really is no difference between them.  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) with things like this, there are many many different opinions which is why I believe that choice of mouse is really personal preference and gaming style.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

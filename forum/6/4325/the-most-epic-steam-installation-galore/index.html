	<div class="content">THIS IS MADE RIGHT ON A FRESH , UPDATED DRIVER WIN VISTA ULTIMATE 64 bit.<br>
<br>
I NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE IN YEARS WITH THE SAME HARDWARE/OS.<br>
<br>
<br>
what happened:<br>
<br>
I pop my <span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%">EPISODE:ONE dvd</span> in the comp and install it.<br>
I run steam, log in etc..<br>
Click on dm or episode one<br>
"steam has found a problem with your local game files"<br>
<span style="font-size:50%;line-height:116%"><em class="text-italics">gtfo, these are dvd files.</em></span><br>
<br>
<br>
So after trying several things, i decide to uninstall everything and use...<br>
<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%">Backed up steam folder with GCF/working files... </span><br>
<br>
Most unstable piece of shit i have ever witnessed, dont even get me started.<br>
<br>
So I...<span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%">Stop fucking around and install games via steam</span><br>
installed steam, <br>
downloaded game(s), <br>
i click on a game.... game appears to be loading for a second but then, it's not.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's really retarded as I never had any problem getting my steam games to run and now is the 5th hour i spend trying to figure how what the hell is going on.<br>
<br>
I experienced every problems in the world and nothing on steam or on the first 13 google result pages could help me so far, dont ask me to delete the client registry blob or i'll find you and paint your dog pink.<br>

	<div class="content">i have to leave for the doctors but ill think about this.  <br>
<br>
2 suggetions i have atm<br>
<br>
1-steam never properly installed itself and is continuesly trying to update and/or finish the install.  the game cant launch because some of the files it needs are being used.<br>
<br>
2-you have a corrupt sector on your HD and/or a bad install of your OS.  when i format my HD i never use windows to do it. i use a DOS like program called FDISK.  when i format i type  format c:/c   the "/c" switch tells the program to format the HD but also check for corrupt sectors and mark them as such so basically the OS will skip over them on its install.  <br>
<br>
like i said, thats all i can think of atm.  ill ponder more tho</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi guys i did look on forum before writing this ,<br>
<br>
So if i should post in one them, Then I sorry about making new post .<br>
But any ways ,Just wanted to say what a pain in the ass mouse acceleration really can be <br>
.Well for me its a living nightmare .And for lots more over the net from what i can really see .I think if microsoft labed a windows mouse acceleration free lol i think there would have bigger sales lol only joking :DD<br>
Ok let me tel you so things .<br>
I am running under WinXp SP3 .Oh know lol :S<br>
I have deathadder with software all installed and firmware is 1.27 driver is 1.09 ...<br>
I have mouse sens set up just how i like it pollrate 1000 /1800DPI. <br>
But my problem is this &gt; I get the mouse feeling just great and get mouse acceleration disabled by using MouseFix reg .<br>
And i use the command options -noforcemparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd when booting hl2dm .+ lol bcz off all the problems i started using the Accelfix ...<br>
And was all working amazing for me nice feeling ingame i was happy .Then it was like some <br>
one just flicked a switch and then it was back ON again .<br>
I no its ON for sure because i done some test when it was off to see how far i could turn <br>
and so .I had mouse set ingame at 1.3 with low sens at desk top .<br>
And i like to have it so that i can do one swing from front to back so if any one is <br>
coming up on me i can turn fast and fire ,but now with all same settings and i turn i do <br>
all most 360 ,Dont get why its doing this to be very honest .I have had no windows updates <br>
not installed any other games that may of installed some thing to make it come back .<br>
Just one min its perfect then its not ..<br>
Just making me feel very frustrated .Because when i get asked now to come play wars i cant <br>
because i feel that i will now just get my ass kicked bad and lose for the team ...<br>
So if any you gamers have any ideas how to fix this for ever so i can just play with out the worry is it going to come back on when i am playing ..<br>
<br>
Cheers guys for reading have good one ..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

mine developed tracking issues after one year.  had the proper driver and flashed the firmware correctly.  they kept telling me to clean the lens.  never would replace it.  so i ditched it.  when it worked correctly... it was the best mouse i ever had.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">What is your setting in windows under control panel, mouse, pointer?<br>
Mine is at 6 (dead on in the middle) between slow and fast.<br>
I use a deathadder latest firmware and drivers same as you. 1000hz pollrate 1800 dpi, ingame sensitivity 1.0 or .70 for low grav killbox. I have never had a issue with mine, maybe you have some old problem relating to a registry key or something. <br>
If I were you I would first make a backup of registry, uninstall razer software, use a registry cleaner, reboot, reinstall razer software and dont worry about those fixes and settings you are using, I dont think that is necessary at all. While your at it I would back up your cfg.cfg and then delete it and let the game create a new one, then rebind your stuff or use your auto exec without stuff relating to the mouse.<br>
I have tried many mice and this deathadder is the best thing I have ever used so far in regards to consistency with sensitivity and does not jitter.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@CellarDweller :How old is the mouse ,Its about 3 weeks now i would say .<br>
I had another one that i used for about 1 year but botton went wrong on that one .<br>
<br>
<br>
@L2k : I done what you said about uninstalling driver then reg cleaning still nothing its still same as was before i am doomed .<br>
win pointer speed is set to 6 all so .<br>
Here is my settings for razer soft ware ,<br>
This one OFASensitivity=12 in control panel on software shows as 7 but in the ini file show as 12 dont no why that is must be some thing to do with hexadecimal or decimal settings dont no .<br>
Its all abit strange if you ask me ,<br>
You say your using 1.0 or 0.70 ingame ,If thats the case what u have it all set at in sofrware ,standed as it is when install apart from Dpi and poll ??.<br>

<br>
Hello,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are experiencing issues with the Razer device in a particular application, test the device in another application to confirm if the issue is specific to that application. If the Razer device functions properly in a different application, then the issue may be directly related to the application. If so, please contact the manufacturer of that software for application specific troubleshooting.<br>
<br>
If the issue is present in multiple applications, the issue may be specific to the computer itself. Please test the Razer device on another compatible computer. If it functions properly on a different system, then there may be an issue with your computer. Please contact the manufacturer of your computer for system specific diagnostics.<br>
<br>
If you see this issue on multiple computers, your Razer device may be defective.<br>
<br>
<br>
I no its not my pc cant be as was fine ,And i no a number of other players that are having same problems and by just looking all over the net there is 100s .<br>
But i no that alot have vista which i hear is hard to turn off acceleration in ,The only way in that is to add and patched win32k file .</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi guys<br>
<br>
I have found away to stop it now so all is good ,<br>
<br>
I got this wcafix_20080209<br>
<br>
And no more Acceleration ,<br>
This by pass the windows protection on boot up so when you have it off and reboot each time its restarts its off ,<br>
But not to sure if it works in Vista ,<br>
But its working here in Xp ..<br>
<br>
Any ways if any one here is having problems with this just google that name and i am sure your find it if not leave post here and ill upload it some where ..<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help ,<br>
<br>
GL &amp; HF<br>
<br>
Oh and btw another thing i found out about when i was trying to stop this i found some more reg files fixs as such ,There are one here that let u do tests to see if you are suffing found acceleration or not best of just down loading it and having a read this is the file name :::::     cheesemfix</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No the file wcafix_20080209 is not reg fix ,<br>
its fixs the file that is made by microsoft win32k that file as in it the information for mouse acceleration ,And wcafix_20080209 each time windows boot that file patchs the win32k in ram so that its can stop mouse acceleration ,doing it in ram will by pass the windows file protection ,<br>
There is another way all so to do with another file but will feel good for one day then you reboot and all acceleration would be back ,But wcafix_20080209 stops it for ever , Even if you get win updates there is no way it can be stop from working ,<br>
<br>
Well the site that i got it from its add over 25000 downloads .<br>

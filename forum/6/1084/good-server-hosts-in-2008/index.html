	<div class="content">I've been considering starting a pub, and am trying to find a reliable host but haven't had too much luck.  There are so many conflicting reviews and testimonials...its hard to get a feel for who is good and who is not.  The two that are at the top of my list are Veolcity-Servers and ClutchKill.  I've been considering clutchkill because the university server seems pretty stable and performs well.  But some people seem to have some issues with it.  And Velocity-Servers just seems like a solid company, ample data centers, great hardware (best I've seen out of any company so far) and their service seems pretty good.  Anyone know anything about Velocity-Servers track record, or played on one of their servers?<br>
<br>
I would really appreciate some insight on this topic, as I'd rather not waste money, and I want to make sure I get a quality server so people acctually ENJOY playing there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have used gameservers for all of my servers for over a year and have had very little trouble with them.  I have found their control panel easy to use and their prices are more than reasonable for the specs of the machines (quad core with 4 gb of ram) .  On the few times I have needed them, they are usually pretty prompt with support.  There are horror stories no matter what company you go to.  I currently have 6 servers with gameservers and no complaints.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you want a central server and you dont mind paying a little more, I would second nuclear fallout. <br>
Ive had gameservers, fatpipe, and NFO. After almost a year with NFO I have yet to hear someone complain of lag or bad hit reg (bad being worse than it is already by default <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">) <br>
Installs, updates and any support you need is handled in minutes.<br>
<br>
I would stay away from little known companies, who are simply renting a dedicated box and then sub leasing game servers to end users. These machines are running too many games and tend to have lag spikes, any value you may see financially will be lost in poor performance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Our Clan has been with Art of War Central for as long as I've been playing.  We recently developed a horrible lag issue on our St Louis server.  All 3 of our servers were on one box, all 3 would spike at the same time with latency reaching the low 300's.  Very slowly the spike would fall back into the mid 100's and stay for several minutes before returning to normal.  It was cyclic and almost predictable.  AOWC told us they saw no issues.<br>
<br>
Our Clan Leader finally convinced them to move us out of the St Louis box and into 3 different boxes in 3 different locations.  But I think it really took some arm twisting on our part.  So maybe avoid AOWC.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've alwyas been a supporter of "You pay for what you get," but I mean christ what do I get with that a BJ everytime I sign on?  Gonna do some IP tests between Clutch Kill, Fatpipe, and Velocity Servers tonight to see where they all stand.

Here's my server preferences, <strong class="text-strong">12slot, 66tick, dallas datacenter.</strong>  I'm gonna hold off on anything like High CPU Prioity for the first month and then add it on the second to see if it acctually does anything.  Unless you know that its actually worth the money, then i'll definately get it.

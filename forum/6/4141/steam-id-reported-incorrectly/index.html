	<div class="content">Have any of you heard of this.. I have a CTF server, it seems to be fine except for one thing, if you join the server and do a 'status' it will report you as having a different Steam ID than your actual ID. This is happening to others not just myself and it is only on the CTF server, other servers report correctly. If you want to see for yourself, here is the IP:<br>

208.70.77.162:27040<br>
<br>
I'm asking because I have a ticket in but i'm not sure the hosts understand what is going on. They asked me to update the server via Steam which I had already done by the time they asked and it didn't solve anything. I've already reinstalled the server and that didn't fix anything either so I'm thinking its either a Steam bug or they have some problem with the server itself. Any ideas?<br>
<br>
Thank you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Could it also be a problem with the way the mod is seen via Steam?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

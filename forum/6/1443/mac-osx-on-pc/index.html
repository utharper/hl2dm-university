<br>
This Hack works on Intel PC’s with atleast SSE3 <br>
You need to format your Leopard Partition to HFS+ <br>
Make Sure you install Leopard on MBR and not GUID or it won’t boot. <br>
More Patched DVD’s from Uphuck, Netkas is in the works so it would be better if you wait for the polished releases to come out</span></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well i do alot of Page Layout and just because of Extensis' Suitcase that deals with the FONTS, i use mac for my page layout jobs.<br>
<br>
There's no real differences, hell some might say ''Well i like the way mac layed out their stuff better'' <br>
<br>
Wich isnt my case, but some might want something else then windows, now it's possible.<br>
<br>
Honestly i don't understand why'd anyone buy MAC's since it's such a fucking pain in the ass if something's wrong with it.<br>
<br>
The reason i didn't buy a laptop in the first place was because i didn't really needed to carry my computer round, but i could've had this need once in college. But if something goes wrong and I know what's the problem, i can't do shit, i can't upgrade, i can't overclock or my guarantee is busted. Same for macs, you have to give your computer to a friggin tech just to add 1gb of ram,jesus do they think we're kids? Wich amazes me man, Most of the owned macs are in design companies and if something's wrong you have to give it away to a tech. wow? I'd rather take 15 mins cross the street find a Future Shop or a Circuit City and buy more ram.<br>
<br>
anyway,since mac can run windows and windows can run mac OS leopard, it's just a 'life style brand whore' choice now. Just like the iPod, there's so many other mp3 players with more features, out there (refering to the nano) and whenever i talk about it people reply stuff like ''well, you know man, it's iPod!" like emm ok? ''they give 5 free itunestrack when you buy it and you have a vip account ...'' yea and if i bought an mp3 and not a cd player it's probably because i didn't wanted to pay the tracks ty i don't need iTunes and the horrible way it consumes a ridiculous amount of ram.<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Yeah Conflict, I think we all know that. Most of ppl don't care so much about computers, and Mac is always WIN with their designs and stuff. Yeah, it looks cool so everybody wants some.<br>
<br>
About iTunes, I think the only worst program from playing media is MS Windows Media Player. I don't like any of those but I rather iTunes than MSWMP so...<br>
<br>
If I gotta buy a computer for home use which it doesn't include gaming, I'll go to Apple for sure.<br>
<br>
Mac is so friendly for those who doesn't care about their computer. So simple, it's all about clicking and clicking, lol.<br>

I do not agree with you soiz, I take care of several macs and the users still have problems. They don't even know if they have malware since many are not running any antivirus because they think they are some how immune to it. They just assume it does not. And they spend alot of time making things that are not made for macs work on them. All the same problems pop up and macs have terrible multi screen implementation and if you try to stick any other part on them even a monitor you very quickly run into problems. Also get ready to drop double the price of anyone else on the same hardware. I just don't see the appeal I personally think people believe the commercials to much and need to step back and say you know what apple is making those commercials no bias there right? Also the mac world is like if it doesnt work buy a new one rather then holding apple responsible for more  compatibility. Yet apple has an extremely reduced set of hardware to even support. Apple does a good job with the hype though and people buy into it.<br>

Greater compatibility<br>
Greater software choice<br>
Greater hardware choice<br>
Greater competition among PC systems and parts manufacturers = better product development<br>

MAC/Apple claims to be better with computer graphics software, but honestly with the way things are now, I cant see that they have such a great advantage in that area over PC.  <br>

I agree with you. What I'm saying is that most people just care about how good looks Apple, outside and inside. For example, my brother everytime he sees an iMac or MacBook Pro in a movie (Transformers, I am Legend, ETC ETC ETC ETC) he says "See? I told you they are the best" and I lol a lot. The sad thing is that most of regular users most think the same.<br>
<br>
Now, about multi-screen implementation I did it tons of times with my MacBook Pro and I didn't have problems at all. One screen was working at 1400xcan'remember and the other one -which I'm using now- 1680x1050. Plus I played CS 1.6 with multi-display and my framerate was 40 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

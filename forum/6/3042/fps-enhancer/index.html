Also don't have v-syc on. For your card should be hitting 250fps easy with the fps ehancer. if you card is set to run at high graphics the fps enhancer is going to work that well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

___________________<br>

<br>
An aside (and my point): FPS values are widely misunderstood and clearly overrated.<br>
Only question you should bother yourself with is <strong class="text-strong">ARE YOU LAGGING LOCALLY?!!!</strong><br>
LAG can occur at high fps values and at the same time you can get super smooth play at super low fps values.<br>
snap out of this relentless obsession with watching FPS people.<br>
<br>
If you're lagging locally then you may have a problem HW / settings or driver related. this is all it's about.<br>

I get 600 fps easily, but in a local server. If not a local server I play at 150 - 450 fps. Makes a big diference. With all graphics minimum. Make sure you are not using v-sync. That takes it all away. It has been said already, if your monitor is at 60hz you have 60fps, etc, and can only get lower, not higher.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

sorry mate but that is wrong. i have two machines with two monitors both at 60 and i can get up to 320 FPS ingame. it can get lower of course but no doubt your mon rr is not the bar for FPS.<br>

	<div class="content">well, I'm not the best person to talk about v-sync and monitor refresh rates, but my fps would go down to my rr when I turned it on. I once put the rr to 120 just to see what would happen and it went to 120 fps. This was the only test I ever made, so I can't say it's consistent. And then again, rr and v-s are not my specialty. I just got that conclusion.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, Skaruts was stating that if he had his v-sync enabled then it would reduce/lock his FPS to his monitor refresh rate (commonly 60). which AFAIK is correct.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

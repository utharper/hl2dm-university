On my widescreen at 16:10 going up in FOV in pro mod has a different effect and it kinda looks the same but with more viewing area on the sides. When using the widescreen I put it as high as I can, on a non widescreen I leave it at default or low.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you have a CRT you can set it to wide screen and adjust your monitor height and width to make it look right. if you have an LCD you can use 1:1 pixel mapping or scaling to set it to any resolution. There is no need to unlock the FOV. <br>
<br>
I know I am usually the lone guy out but I think the game is better when there is less client side tweaking to take advantages all it does is serve to make the game look like total ass in the name of winning and give the leets more shit to help them stomp on noobs. Most FOV people are holdouts from the past. The point of a game is to roughly compete on a fair playing field and I think adding more client side settings makes it harder to make that happen. Now not only does the guy have a more powerful computer then me he also has 160 FOV his game looks like ass but he has every advantage besides actual personal skill known to man. Then I am forced to sink to that level and screw up my game looks in order to compete. Then you also get zoom scripts being written. If you are talking with valve and wanting to enable this then go ahead and reverse all cheat protected cvars for various other visuals. Allow them to turn off grass and run texture size down to nothing so walls can be flat and turn on full bright after all this is the point behind the FOV command to allow people to increase their view so they can see more people and use less other skills like sound and general game smarts to locate opponents. If you unlock it then you have to set a limit right? Then what is the limit? why have a limit? It all just gets stupid we got a working system now while it is not perfect unlocking FOV will not make anything better for the game as a whole, and its just going to add another variable that we have to think about when trying to spot cheaters as well making it all the harder to convict them. <br>
<br>
Also I should add that over time gaming has been moving away from this and towards a more standardized fair play where most people have limits to what they can do. It always bugs me when we seek to step backwards from the progress we have made. In the early days alot of settings on games were just left in cause some odd people had hardware that would not work with out them or cause the dev company simply forgot to lock it when they had it tweaked to the value they liked. After that people became addicted to them and the company could not remove them without the old stubborn players crying. But even with all that if you look at the general trends even in old stubborn games like quake settings that were once open are now restricted usually ranges are set or many are just locked in place. A progressive thinker extrapolates this to the future and realizes that standardization is the future of gaming because when all the pros meet and they all have the jacked up view they realize their original advantage no longer exists since everyone has taken it and now all they have achieved was making a perfectly fine looking game look like ass while getting beat by the same players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Widescreen monitor is best way to increase FOV it just adds on extra width so the view isnt stretched.<br>

<br>
If the FOV is just right and your physical eyepoint is centered with respect to the FOV, it suddenly tricks the brain into thinking the scene is actually 3D, because the monitor will almost completely fill your real FOV and the distorted area is more or less correct for your peripheral vision.  It's pretty trippy, but pretty damn anti-ergonomic.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

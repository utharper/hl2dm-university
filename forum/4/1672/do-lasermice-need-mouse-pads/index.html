<br>
I use my G5 on the wood veneer, and this desk is very new already I see the finish and material fading, I was looking at this one and if you want large well my friend, this is gargantuan <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817114182&amp;Tpk=XTRAC%2BXL" class="postlink">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... XTRAC%2bXL</a><br>
<br>
I have read countless reviews of how well it works with the g5 and others, so check it out, it is so large lots of people have cut it in half and have a spare.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I also use the Razer Mantis Control Pad and I'm very happy with it.  I use a medium sense but keep going lower and lower so its nice to have the extra space to work with, I'll never run out of pad.  I tried my razer death adder on my wooden desktop, a flanel shirt, white printer paper, white printer paper with text printed on it, a hard plastic top mouse pad and none of them performed nearly as consistently or as well as the mantis pad.   IMO there is something to be said for using a gaming mouse pad (or any other high quality pad of your liking) when using a high precision gaming mouse be it laser, optical or infrared...but there are tons of people who disagree, so my advice is to do some testing of your own.  I would suggest a large tightly woven cloth surface that doesn't create a lot of friction.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I couldnt find a mousepad that was big enough.  The ones I can find around here are are like 6 x 8 inches and I run off of them sometimes.  So I am now using a 10x 14 white plastic cutting board for a mouse pad mainly because I noticed that the mouse was wearing the top of my keyboard shelf away.  I put a rubber no skid pad under the cutting board to keep it from sliding and it seems to work great so far.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Razer mantis is pretty good. Steel has some good mousepads too, like the 5L<br>

I'm using a Steel QcK for the moment, but it's getting too little cuz the sens I use now is a lot lower than the one I used before, so I might buy a new one</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

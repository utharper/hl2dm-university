This is uber gay, we need to form a protest on the steam forums in both hl2dm and css forums, get everyone u know to post so that they change that.<br>
If u dont know wat im on about, go into css or hl2dm an do the following.<br>
And notice how much more accurate an customisable it is.<br>

Did you see this part? D:<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
"Interesting information there, and using it I was able to calculate the scalars that windows uses to control pointer speed. If you're using a setting that's not 6, then <strong class="text-strong">the table that follows shows what you need to multiply your in-game sensitivity by to use the correct setting and not change your overall sensitivity in CS:S.</strong><br>
<br>
   1. 0.03125<br>
   2. 0.0625<br>
   3. 0.25<br>
   4. 0.5<br>
   5. 0.75<br>
   6. 1.<br>
   7. 1.5<br>
   8. 2.<br>
   9. 2.5<br>
  10. 3.<br>
  11. 3.5"</em><br>
<br>
So multiply your sens by .75 ko and it'll go back to your old sens ;p</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">To my sidmay I found my win setting at notch no. 7, but when I fixed this and went back to playing there was no difference. Probably due to the fact that I formerly had the Advanced Mouseware setting to use game settings rather than OS specific ones.<br>
<br>
I did, however, try out the finding your optimal sens method and have now upped it from 1.2 to 1.3 (@1600dpi) since it also makes bunny hopping slightly easier to pull off. I also found that using USB rate 1000 didn't work reliably with my MX518 but that 500 was flawless.<br>
<br>
All in all a very good guide. Now I just need to replace one of the skatez that I saw is missing from my mouse.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Gravjump:</span></strong> the folowing props are excellent to gravjump; Big crates (double crates), Small white pipes heater,toilet,sink. in order to get the maximum height stand on a edge of the prop you are standing on and look directly down on it, then primary fire yourself up the air, dont jump or you might totally miss or even damage/kill yourself. This is a good method for quick escapes and reach unreachable spots on a map.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Orb Jump</span></strong>: mostly used in dm_overwatch and seen in some vid by using a combination of 2 green cabinets, heres a better alternative,<br>
1) go to xbow building<br>
2) shoot/gravgun/get angry/yell at the HOTEL sign until it falls down <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
3) take that sign and bring it in the area you want to go very high.<br>
4)place it on the sidewalk in order to half half of it over the street and the other half placed flat on the sidewalk.<br>
5)Stand on the sign where its on the sidewalk<br>
6) fire and orb and get it in your gravgun (non gravgunned orb will fail to make you jump high or might even break the prop, gg hotel sign)<br>
7)shoot that orb on the part of the sign that is over the street.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shoot here<br>
v<br>
______you_   &lt;-Standing on the Hotel sign<br>
OOO &lt;-sidewalk <br>
<br>
Happy flying.<br>

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Alarms</span></strong>: In pubs or 1v1 this can always come in handy, a chair or a CRT screen at the botom or top of a ladder will block the oponent and force him to move this prop in order to get up wich will make noise and alert you. Just dont forget theres something there to not get screwed over your own tricks <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
Place crates in doorways so you're oponents have to smash em to pass, wich is very noisy, if you dont hear anything maybe that means you're oponent decided to take another way or is camping.<br>
<br>
Place stuff in the vents if you don't use them, it slows down fastcrouchers and alerts you whenever someone is entering one of those vents.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Blocking the lockdown fan</span></strong>: Take the shovel and stick it horizontaly in the fan and make sure it doesnt fall as soon as you let it go off your ggun. You're now safe...fan-wise, people will know you're in there tho,,,use youre imagination? ^^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I thought since the last update you no longer have to move the object at the bottom of the stairs? infact i think in lockdown i've seen people try to block that ladder with the chair and all i had to do was sprint jump and walk up.<br>
<br>
and thats a good idea with the shovel, i tried something similiar but i used that damned plank in there, which seems to get its ass kicked pretty quickly, i'll have to try the shovel i guess.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well you're right there about the ladder...but it still feels very random cuz it hapened to me yeserday or so, plus, people go used to get stuck in those situations so its most likely a reflex to throw them away and make noise <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This is perhaps a more effective way to improve your tracking ability along with your aiming skills. I find that fast twitch gaming involves dexterity along with muscle memory in performing advanced techniques such as bunny hopping - that requires  precision timing for full effectiveness. This skill can be trained over time with repetition. However, I find that  precision  aiming, on the  other hand, takes much longer to master and a lot of time, providing incremental results.  <br>
<br>
A while ago while trying to find a way to improve the speed and effectiveness with which I read, I stumbled upon a neat little program that helps you do just that. I hope I don't come off as a peddler in this thread, my intention is to help, anyway the program is called  eyeQ, and I'm sure you can <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/search/eyeq/0/99/0" class="postlink">'<span style="color:#FF0000">get it</span>'</a>, what it does is it exercises your eye muscles, making them more adept to tracking...really fast!<br>
<br>
It's interesting really, because when we read, we do so in chunks, not actually reading each letter, but recognizing entire words. The program I mentioned starts you off, not by reading words, but trains you to pick up images, and it gets faster and faster, training your eye muscles' ability to pick up objects faster and faster, and not just horizontally but vertically and diagonally - that's why I found it so  beneficial to my gaming skills. When you first use the program, you're eyes will actually get a workout, and they may even hurt a little kinda like when you work out at a gym. It even tells you to take a full days rest in between sessions.<br>
<br>
Over time, maybe a couple of weeks or so, what you'll find is that your eyes will move a lot quicker, and you'll be able to pick up stuff on screen faster, enabling you to react better.  For me, my eyes became quick enough that gaming at 60 FPS started to look choppy, so I ended up switching to 120 FPS with V-Sync so that the game would look smoother.  I had to decrease my monitor's resolution, but I can say that it definitely makes a difference!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, lol, maybe you know that they're Swedishm (as am I). Couple of years back there was this a rerun of an educational program on one of the national channels. This was a drum school with Tomas Haake of Meshuggah on drums. I clearly remember how he did some kind of 7/4 thing on the drums, which seems pretty reasonable if somewhat complex. Then he said "and then you just repeat the rythm and play it faster, like this" and he did it again but probably 3-4 times as fast and I was like "oh shit"!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
Anyone interested in this kind of music should get their latest album ObZen of this year. Their concept really comes together very nicely there. Math metal at its best!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The thing with Meshuggah's music is that the drums usually stay in 4 or other time sigs while the guitars overlap in uneven time signatures, giving them an awesome jarring strange quality.<br>
The guitarists may play the same riff in the same time but start their measures on a different beat, like the second rhythm starting on 2 or 3.<br>
<br>
This playing originates with King Crimson.<br>
You can hear this kind of time play on most all their albums starting with Discipline.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@ [EYE] Valar, I had to wikipedia it, Meshuggah was formed in Umeå, Sweden in 1987.  The band's name is Yiddish for "crazy" (משוגע).<br>
<br>
Yiddish eh? I didn't know that there were Jewish people living in Sweden, apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Sweden" class="postlink">since the 1600's</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

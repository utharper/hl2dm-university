	<div class="content">Been playing a while ,still crap at it lol ,have read,studied,watched all the movement stuff and get it, but my fingers dont.<br>
I have been blessed with two very large hands that perform like two left ones.(they are good at other things )<br>
The instruction videos are great but they dont show what peoples hands are doing ,so does anyone fancy webcamming there hands and hopefully the screen while they move so i can maybe get it a bit more insight into what I should be doing ,<br>
Hope this makes sense <br>
Cheers<br>

	<div class="content">its all about muscle memory.  getting your muscles(brain) to recall the finger movements you need.  being from EYE its prolly not something you practice a lot cause you guys are low grav most of the time.  strafe jump into your first hop, build up some speed on the ground first.  pretty soon you will just do it naturally, like driving a manual transmission car or riding a bike. i agree watching ppl do the bhop didnt really help me at all cause i cant see their fingers.  contact luke, he gave me some really good advise.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">even if you saw someones fingers it still wont help, but if you want to see it here is a clip of Dallas playing where you can see his fingers:<br>

I find that most peoples problems when trying to learn is that they can not let go of forward key.<br>
<br>
If you want to learn the bhop you must learn how to do a good strafe jump or circle jump as its called in some games. To do this you use forward, then hit sprint and hold for about 3 bars on the aux meter, once you reach max sprint speed you must hit jump and one of your right or left strafe keys still holding forward and at the same time slightly curve your mouse in the direction you are strafing (right or left).  You will now be in the air at a decent velocity (should be 400+ on the vel meter, type cl_showpos in console to see vel meter) now here is the important part: once you are in the air, you MUST let go of the forward key and immediately hold the crouch key. Do NOT let go of the crouch key, practice doing this and holding crouch, you should land on the other side of the gap while still holding crouch.<br>
 Once you have mastered that jump you should be able to clear level 10 consistently on a map called P-train, and once you are consistent with that you can move to the next step.<br>
<br>
The next step will be that once you have made that initial strafe jump, and you are about to land CROUCHED you hit jump just before touching the ground (still holding crouch), which will put you into overbounce mode. While still holding crouch (and NO forward) now it is just a matter of hitting jump everytime you are about to touch the ground. If you are timing it correctly you should be able to maintain a decent speed for about 3-5 bounces or hops, if you look at your vel meter you will see your vel speed dropping slightly with each jump after 3rd bounce. Once your vel has gone below about 375 you are going to want to to stop the process, let go of crouch and restart the whole process over. The idea is to keep your vel speed above 450, but for a beginner if you can maintain 375-400 your on the right track and will improve over time.<br>
<br>
After you have gotten the basics down there is another factor to add in which is alternating your strafe keys in the middle of the overbounce to turn corners or regain some more velocity by curving you mouse and stafing in the middle of a overbounce but this is not necessary to bhop and you can mess with that after you have learned how to do teh basic straight line bhop.<br>
<br>
Good luck, dont get frustrated and prepare to spend a great amount of time learning to do this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

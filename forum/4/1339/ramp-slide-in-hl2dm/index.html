	<div class="content">It seems you can ramp slide in hl2dm, I kinda knew you probly could but I've never heard anyone talk about it. I searched the forums for this and couldn't find anything that described the technique, only little pieces of text that hint at it being possible.  First of all is this a reliable technique that can be consistantly recreated?  Second, how is it done reliably?  I only ask this because I was practicing bhopping on biohazard and as I exited the bathroom with the shotty and combine ball, I tried to starfe jump up onto the L shaped stairs.  I made it up and wsa on the edge and just tried to do a bunny hop to hold my momentum and ended up sliding up the stair case with momentum to spare at the top.  I started to try and recreate this and after a while I was getting up the stairs with one strafe jump in one smooth motion with lots of momentum when I reached the top to go bhopping away.  This seems like it would be a ramp slide since the stairs were boardered with ramps.  I can't however do the same thing on lostvillage and still have a ton of momentum at the top...amybe its a little bit of a different technique.  I was just hoping some one who knows for sure could clarify for me and possibly explain the technique.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I made it up both stairs in one fluid strafe jump and bounce.  Do you have to keep spaming it as you go up the ramp, or is it just a matter of getting the right timing when you first hit the ramp resulting in a slide the rest of the ramp?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Mine also isn't 100% consistant yet so I don't think im doing the same thing everytime, keystroke and mouse wise.  Meh i guess I'll just experiment with it and see if I can find a key/mouse combo that consistanly results in a "ramp slide."  <br>

<br>
There is always an ending slide to a landing hop because of the friction in a server, instead of coming to a stop, you're pressing jump, and since it is slanted, you keep that ending slide going with your previous jumping momentum, so you will eventually come to a stop if the slant is high enough, (depending on server variables), but this knowledge can mean the difference between getting some nice weapons, or getting capped in the ass.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lets see if I can help.<br>
I think he means for instance, you know on lostvillage, from tank to that "block" or "metal wall" (whatever), there is this ramp. Sometimes when you bhop over it while going up, you don't stop, but slide over it and go sent up high (not much).<br>
It's weird but useful....I just do it from time to time without no idea on how I do....It just happends =/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thats exactly what I was trying to describe, thanks Onti.  I'll make a demo tonight of the one in Biohazard and post it.  Now whats this about trimping?  Does this also work in hl2dm?  I really want to get a handle on what is possible with advanced movement, casue I thought I knew until I accidentally ramp slid and was like "huh that was different." i've seen all of this demonstrated in Q3 vids but never seen people capitalizing on it in hl2dm.  Maybe if we had more quake style maps it would be more popular.  I would just think that advanced movement tecniques like ramp sliding and "trimping" would be as much of a "must learn" as bhopping.  <blockquote><div><cite>Coke. wrote:</cite>I'm sure you guys do it all the time without thinking it's a big deal, no?</div></blockquote>  This is why im guessing these tecniques aren't listed in the advanced movement area, its porbly a natural movement to all the "ubers" they don't even realize their doing it. lol (compliment not a troll) I'm quite pleased tell yah the truth, another aspect of movement to undertsand and master.  I love the movement in this game, its one of the major reasons the bugs haven't driven me away.

basically you need a clipped staircase (so it's like a ramp) or a ramp, or a staircase with edges on the side that you can slide up on so you can get enough speed and keep jumping up it ? im not sure how to explain it I just do it D:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

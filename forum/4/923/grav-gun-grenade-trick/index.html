	<div class="content">I hope this is the correct forum to post this but how do guys toss grenades so quickly and catch them in their Grav Gun in quick sucession? I read about "cooking" the grenade but you can only do one at a time right?<br>
<br>
On some servers, I have guys Grav gun grenade me with 3 grenades in less than two seconds. I am going WTH!! Are they using a script to do this?<br>
<br>
Sorry if it sounds like a noob question but I have only been playing HL2DM for about 2 weeks worth.<br>

	<div class="content">Three nades in 2 seconds is a bit unrealistic, but you can them up pretty fast depending on how long you need to hold them. You can do it faster manually than any script, so no, no scripts.<br>
<br>
Check out the video tutorial in our training vids section. Really it is just practice and perfect timing. I've had people who have accused me of scripting, but really they just didn't realize how easy it is after some time doing it.<br>
<br>
A good way to practice is to set nade as default weapon, and then fire off two every time you die. Once you get advanced I recommend grav gun as default thereafter. If you need any help with default weapon, let me know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">These guys usually have the grav gun and then I get BAM! BAM! two grenades out that quick. Kills me all the time like that. Now, I can catch them with my grav gun but it takes a sec to throw it out and then retreive it. These guys do it without any delay. It is like they have a nade launcher on their grav gun instead.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah the nade should go almost instantaneously into your grav gun if you time it right. Download a few of the frag vids on here and you will see:<br>

Mine is called Metamorphosis. You can see me cook two nades at 8:03 and both throws are with a right click lob done manually.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I guess I should see what you are talking about before saying anything ...but.... wouldn't the grenades just pass by you if they cook them quickly? Depending on the enemies distance you need to hold more or less the grenade in your grav.<br>
If you are in a close fight, there is no way they can shot them in 2 secs, non would damage you (with exeptions lol)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's a lot of practice and timing. Most people have their nades close to their grav guns with "binds", keys to switch fast. Mine for example are G and T, g for grav gun. Most of it for me is just practice and depending if you shoot the nade with primary or secondary fire you can get them off pretty quick. I've also had a lot of practice trying to catch nades with the grav gun. It's another one of those "experience" things in the game that just comes with time once you get the basic point of it down.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

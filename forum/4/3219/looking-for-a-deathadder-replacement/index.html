	<div class="content">Ok, so the thumb button (mb5) on my deathadder just snapped off inside it so I'm looking for a replacement...  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> <br>
<br>
preferably not another deathadder as the build quality was pretty poor (cable had broken, mb1 lost it's click, bottom of the mouse  got scratched to fuck)<br>
<br>
what would be a good alternative?<br>
<br>
Logitech G5 or G9?<br>
Roccat Kone?<br>
SteelSeries Ikari?<br>
<br>
Also I'm a low sen player, I was using the deathadder at 0.65 @ 1800, so I'm not too sure how some laser mice would handle that.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advanced  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Dotn think a laser mouse will be able to handle that low sensivity I know my G9 can't handle quick 180 with 0.61 @ 2000DPI  (G9 are 3200DPI) you could try a MX518 same DPI as deathadder.<br>
<br>
No idea what those other 2 you mentioned are like.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was using the Goliathus(control) for a while but I've gone back to using the eXactmat(control side) as it's far far far more accurate/responsive/faster etc etc.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Trust me mouse works perfect, and the mouse1 button after the fix I applied works even better than when brand new lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah I've fixed the previous problems myself, first off I replaced the cable with a mesh cable from another mouse, then bent the mb1 back as suggested on razerblueprints.net... maybe a little too far  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  as for the mb5 I don't have any super glue at the moment but I'll get some and give it ago. it's kinda hard to get to the actual break but if I can find a way I'll glue it back on. Shouldn't of broken off in the first place though, I shouldn't of been able to push the button so far in that it broke  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ive used the Logitech G5 original model with only the back button for quite sometime, but for almost a year now Ive been using the Razer Lachesis that goes up to 4000 dpi. Id recommend that mouse also. <br>

Razer is also coming out with some other mice with lower peak dpi that have the same shape as the Lachesis from the looks of it too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

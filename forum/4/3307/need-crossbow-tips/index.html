	<div class="content">the crossbow is prediction weapon in every sense of the word, which means you do not aim right on target unless the target is not moving in any direction.<br>
 The only way to get good with it is to use it and practice it a lot. The only tip I can really give you is to watch your opponent, notice his movements, how far he strafe jumps (if he is) and try to get an idea of his rhythm so that you can lead your shot in a manner he will run into it more or less when the two cross paths.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">something I would add is that your first instinct with the bow is usually right, if you just twitch and shoot at the first sign of the oponent thats usually the right thing to do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's a great weapon to lead with, but if you land a bolt and the opponent doesn't die, chop to a better finishing weapon.<br>
<br>
At really long range I like to aim directly at the opponent. Trying to predict at that distance is fairly futile, and there is a good chance they will double back into your bolt by the time it arrives anyway.<br>
<br>
To practice the bow, stick a prop around a corner somewhere, then leap out from cover and hit the prop as fast as you can. I'm talking snap shot, no lining up/aiming. Tossing shit in the air and shooting it as it falls is also helpful.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what everyone else said, the xbow is definitely a lead/prediction weapon.  throwing props in the air and shooting them is good practice.<br>
<br>
also, getting bank shots down is essential to truly mastering the crossbow.  practice hitting walls at a 45 degree angle so the bolts bounce off the walls.  also when you see a curved wall anywhere in a map (biohazard and lostarena have alot of these), practice shooting at the exact place where the wall curves so that the bolt banks around the curve.  I had screenshots of exactly where to hit the wall on my old computer but not on my new one unfortunately.  alot of the frag videos on here (Unwonted, Dark Files, LSD Cal Frags, Poconut's short video) have examples of this shot so watch those vids.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I just got another request via PM. I've tried to post a bunch of images here, but I was told they were racist. Here's a massive image dump that I've collected over the years. <a href="http://s533.photobucket.com/albums/ee332/badinfluence66/?start=all" class="postlink">http://s533.photobucket.com/albums/ee33 ... ?start=all</a><br>

Hopefully posting a link to racist images isn't bad. Also, beware, some of they are not safe for work.<br>

<br>
for example, a SMG shot in the head takes 16 freakin dmg!<br>
<br>
and i think that the number of rockets of the RPG, should be 1 (0 is my preference =)<br>
<br>
<br>
how about you? how much do you hate them?<br>

	<div class="content">I used to hate the rpg.  Now I don't.  If you play a map over and over again, lockdown, overwatch, etc ... their will be weapons that are whored.  I personally don't like the mag right now.  People use it now just for the headshot announcement ( ironic, eh? ).  But you get in a server with 5 or 6 mag whores and it's not worth playing.<br>
<br>
Of course, this speaks to weapon placement and balance.<br>
<br>
But no weapon is hated by me.  I will use 'em all.  Even the mag.  <br>
<br>
My primary reason for playing is trying for the stupidest kills possible.  Thowing a barrel at somebody and then hitting it with the shotty to blow the person up.  Cooking a nade and JIHADing one or more players.  Hitting a person with a smg1 grenade in mid air.  Timing and throwing a slam across a room to blow a player up.   I don't care about score or rank.  I love the "omfg, how'd you do that" kills <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">rpg is a weapon that i dont use and i find many people i know feel the same way... using a laser guided weapon to score a kill is the easiest way to kill another in the game.<br>
<br>
smg: this is a tricky one. i dont like it when people whore the weapon and constintly use it. BUT, i believe that it can be used skillfully and in this case it is ok to use. If you begin to fire it at an enemy, when they turn round to shoot back u switch quickly to shotgun and finish them off in one shot (or shoot shotgun 1st then finish off with smg)<br>
<br>
i believe you are a skillful player when u have a good aim with magnum and x-bow. killing another from quite a distance with these weapons is a good feat (even though it is usually 1shot=1kill)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Some of us are mag whores.  But most of us like all weapons.  Unfortunately, the mag is one of the easiest weapons to get to in our maps.  Usually I'll use the mag until I find the xbow.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i love the challenge of taking out a RPG whore on overwatch while he is wrecking everyone <br>
<br>
and popping somone in the head w/ the mag and have their rockect fly by unguided is very sexy <br>
<br>
Lol i had like 20k kills with the rockect but i mainly use it as a finisher same as smg if i hit a guy with a 357 and it's not a kill i'll switch to one of these for slightly long distance / close i'll finish w/ the shotgun<br>
<br>
RPG takes some getting use to, i love taking it away from ppl. Like i never ever go to get it in lockdown rather just kill the ppl that do and get blamed for it.<br>
<br>
Overwatch 100% of the time if you just leave the rockect alone and go into the basement and spam tables you'll out whore the rockect easy<br>

	<div class="content">Hi, i don't wanna break the show but ...personally...<br>
<br>
i DO play this game for fun but when it goes to CAL or serious clan v clan game, one must master EVERY weapons and consider the fact that your oponent will use or might use it agaisnt you.<br>
<br>
by NOT using smg/rpg you're starting a step behind.<br>
<br>
don't get me wrong, sometime im like BLEH when im a friggin kiling spree and i end up dead by some random guy with an smg.<br>
<br>
BUT.<br>
<br>
that means that instead of using mag on him i'd ve swtiched to smg too i'd be alive and rocking people still.<br>
<br>
getting used to every weapon and know when and where to use these are crucial.<br>
<br>
Proof is people that have been known to use aimbot's aren't godly players. or even if one had a PERFECT mag without using any cheats and whatnot...you sure would rock in a box but you wold get smoked away in maps where people can bank shot you or play sneaky.<br>
<br>
Personally im a huge xbow fan and from the very moment i started playing and when Dirk started to teach me, all you hear is, DONT SPAM DONT SPAM.<br>
<br>
Now our team tries to win CAL and i had to LEARN spam cuz that's how it works. i handicaped myself by not using orbs/smg nades at all.<br>
<br>
Without spamming em up, one well placed orb or RPG can save your ass and get you a cool multikill.<br>
<br>
If people whine...you used it once in a 30 min game so.. don't feel bad <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
It's like pulling the mag out at a guy that runs towad you with a stunstick.<br>
<br>
It's about staying alive <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hell yes !!, I love to try and get those kinds of kills too ^_^ haha. There's is nothing like a good multikill doing a hard movement with the rpg , or an awesome ricochet with the xbow.<br>

Since i started, i like spamming, but i generally used the xbow, and now i have finally come to realize the importance of the mag, so im trying to improve, and I have really had my improvements Very Happy , but I know im still far from being the best, and thats what helps me to keep wanting to improve Cool<br>
Now i just spam to stay alive( exept if I have the rpg MUAHAHAH) , I generally try first with the xbow, if i miss, change to the mag and try, if that fails too, shotty, and if im near death, its very probable that nades and orbs start flying  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

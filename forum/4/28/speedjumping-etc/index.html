	<div class="content">Between watching people online and the videos on this site, I'm beginning to realize the power of strafe-jumping, bunny-hopping, etc.  What I'm really interested in is a more concrete method; the videos are great, but I just can't seem to replicate them.<br>
<br>
I'm fine with going 1v1 with someone in-game to figure this out, or watching more vids, etc.  Does anyone have suggestions for how to learn this, how to master this, things I can practice, etc?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I personally can't do them either.<br>
<br>
I have issues with my keyboard right now and might have to get a new one to accomplish the advanced movements.  I would suggest finding somebody that can do it in a server and ask them to show you.  I can't get anything from the videos either.  It's just not helpful without seeing what they are doing with their keyboard/mouse at the same time.  1v1 might be your best bet.<br>

If that is a possible time for you I can help you with advanced movement. <br>
Just let me know.<br>
<br>
This site will also feature a course on advanced movement which will break it down into easy steps, from configuration through each step of the movement.<br>
It is going to take some time to complete though. <br>

Do it over and over are you have the basic strafe jumping motion, which then you can keep on practicing until you master it and then you could combine that with more advanced techniques.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Another thing you can do to understand the strafing part better is to create a server on overwatch and set the grav to 0(sv_gravity 0). Then jump and wait till you hit the skybox. Then try to gain as much speed as you can by strafing around (Hold foreward and a strafe key while turning your mouse the same direction).Just try not to crash into the invisible walls on the sides of the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what I did was get a killbox into hammer and removed everything but one spawn point and one mag, then put  "cl_showpos 1" into my cfg.. and started making big ol exaggerated beginner strafejump moves. whenever I got into the mid 4's velocity wise.. I'd hold down duck and bounce. <br>
as my timing has improved and I've gotten more consistent, the basic sequence has become more streamlined and natural, till now I can actually shoot at others some while seeing 4's and some 5's<br>
<br>
here is a vid I made from that time. kindly keep in mind that like 2 weeks before this I'd done over a year w/o ever getting into the 4's under my own power, so I thought this was I very big deal at the time lol<br>

An update on my personal situation, with the help of you guys at the U, I'm almost capable of skating.  I can do it sometimes, and other times I flat out can't.<br>

Thanks for the help, and I hope to continue improving.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The demos are pre-patch and therefore dont work unless you download the HL2DM launcher program by Pincus. Read the entire thread before downloading so you are sure to get the latest version and all the info.<br>

Included in the thread is a post by L2K linking to a place to download the demo pack.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you still need help, let me know and we can jump into a server and see what's going on. I'm usually on from 6-10 EST.<br>
<br>
Also, have you tried the map ptrain?<br>
It definately helps your strafe jump. What I did was put the gravity to something around 500, go through all the jumps, and then increase the gravity slowly until I was back up to the default 600.<br>
<br>
Get back to me on that one =]<br>

/\/\ I still think this is the best way to learn.  I never got strafe jumping it till I understood where the speed came from.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

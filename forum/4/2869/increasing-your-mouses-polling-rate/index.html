are there any disadvantages to doing this?  would it do any damage to the mouse?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think it's your mouse's software allowing you to change it. Only a few gaming mouses from what I hear make it this easy. If this is the case, then it won't damage your mouse but actually supports it 100%. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm actually having a problem where a program that's supossed to change my polling rate (usbmrs11) says I have an invalid usbport.sys file and so won't change it. Looks like it's 125hz for me :/ .</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">higher polling rate means less ms (delay)<br>
So set it to 1000hz. Most gaming mouses allow you to chose that. Normal mouses can be overclocked to achieve it, but as any overclock it may end up ruining it....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think your correct. When I did it manually in vista it increased them all to 1000hz, but my mouse capped at 165mhz lmao.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I cannot yo-yo nades reliably with 500 but I can with 1000, so yeah the less delay has to be better for firing faster as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
i use hidusbf.  allows you to adjust only your mouse usb.  pretty simple really.  and gets around the service pack 3 issue that rendered other usb tweakers useless.<br>
<br>
but i've only adjusted to 500... which reports at 498 consistantly.  when i tried 1000, i was reporting at 800 ish.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">For a long time I used the thumb button on my mouse for "use weapon_physcannon". When I recognized the need for having crouch somewhere else than on ctrl (for advanced movements) I eventually put it on the thumb button instead, only to be faced with the problem of where to put my gg.<br>
<br>
A former clan mate suggested MWHEELUP, a tip which he allegedly got from some "pro" player. I've been using that for some time now, but I'm not sure about it being ok for those twitch grabs - and especially about twitch pushes since scrolling up with my right index finger makes it akward to press MOUSE1 the next instant.<br>
<br>
I briefly tried using the default G for gg but it's a pain when you're not used to it and I want to be convinced it's the right choice if I decide to go this way.<br>
<br>
I realized I could put +attack on MOUSE3 (scroll wheel click) as well, making it possible to quickly switch to gg and push.<br>
<br>
Anyone has any thoughts about this?<br>
<br>
If I go with G I also realized I have the option of using "phys_swap" instead of "use weapon_physcannon". On scroll up it would just be too tricky. I think phys_swap has some advantages but it comes at the cost of having to be aware of wether or not your gg is active or not at all times. Any input on this is also most welcome.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This is a tough one. I have gravity gun on G, my movement is ESDF though. I am so used to it I cant imagine changing it now, although I do lose a few upclose fights if my opponent is scrolling gravity gun and resetting the timer faster than me, I wouldnt call it a match breaking advantage. I scroll up for ar2 and down for smg. Those are my fallback weapons when I have my opponent hurt and he is running for health.<br>
<br>
Only problem with scrolling gravity gun to reset timer is that you are binding attack twice and if you ever have to play in a competition with GUI only you wont be able to do that (yeah I know unlikely, but who knows).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Do you really have to use lastinv to reset the gravgun? Wouldn't, say, the pistol do the job equally good? It's not like you're ever going to run out of pistol ammo on lockdown <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

Basically you switch back and forth between a weapon so it resets the grab timer, grabbing it before you switch weapons again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks, so no special tricks really. Seems pressing a key for lastinv twice might be quicker than scrolling first down and then up. Unless maybe then if you have lastinv on scroll down and scroll exactly two 'clicks'... is that what some people do?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks for the tip. And it reminds me of what I heard in a server a couple of weeks ago. On the topic of bunny hopping the guy said that the reliability of the space bar (assuming you jump with space) could make or break your timing. This, he claimed, was a reason many 'pro' jumpers go with the G15. I take it you don't have any problems with the quality of the wolfclaw space bar?<br>
<br>
Can anyone comment on this? Is the difference between decent quality keyboards that big, and do you presonally find the timing of the jumps that difficult? I would've said that the quality of my Logitech Ultra-Flat is good enough that it's up to me (and the server) wether or not I can time my jumps, not the keyboard.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you are scrolling? You need the key bound to phys_swap not use weapon_physcannon. More people need to define which they are using. If you scroll with phys_swap you should not have any problems. The problem you do have stems from your use of your hand. Your index finger is apparently scrolling and pressing mouse 1. My index finger is on mouse 1, middle finger on the tilt/wheel/mouse3, ring finger on mouse 2, and thumb on mouse4 and 5. only my pinky finger is not used as it stabilizes the mouse. This way I can scroll and shoot or grab all at the same time if needed. Apparently this is rare amoung gamers but you can expect as the future progresses if consoles do not kill us people will begin teaching this hand method as a basic skill, like using laces instead of toes to kick a soccer ball, so I think it wont hurt to make the investment of learning to use all fingers efficiently. <br>
<br>
You can also switch any other way but I can't say any will be better the way ninjins does it assumes he always has a mag which most people are not going to be able to say especially since grav gun battles are so important when you just spawned so unless you are playing aim arena or these other maps with hundreds of mags laying around you could have trouble. If you want to do it what way make your switch to something you should always have like pistol or crowbar/stunstick.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Just curious, why do you think that?<br>

Very good point about the use of fingers Fearsome. It's so obvious it makes me baffled as to why I never thought of that. Now, I just have to find the right moment to start getting used to it. Might as well do it in everyday computer use too.<br>
But are you sure you mean phys_swap? Scrolling a specific number of clicks seems too difficult to me in the heat of battle. Could you explain the reasoning behind this?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Because the gravity gun has a cooldown, meaning you have to wait between pulses. Just try pressing fire as fast as you can and you will get a feel for the rate it can be used at. <br>
<br>
The way around this is to swap weapons out and back to the gravity gun as fast as you can, resetting the cooldown and allowing you to have a much faster gravity gun than joe average player. If you use scrolling you can achieve this at a faster than human rate from switching weapons manually, but you must use phys_swap to do it. If you use physcannon the swap wont take place and the gravity gun will just fire at its usual rof. <br>
<br>
Some think scrolling to reset is cheap and for the advanced technique to be legitimate you should reset it manually (ninjins^), but for the most part it is accepted as reasonable as you are not doing something that cant be achieved manually anyway.<br>

	<div class="content">To clarify, i have attack on mouse 3 (wheel button) lastinv on mwheelup and mwheeldown and weapon_physcannon on Q. To scroll, i depress the mwheel and roll up (for yoyoing orbs or prop battles) or spam up/down (to clear an area of props or to reset a nade or claim a live orb) then press Q again to ensure that im back on gravgun after scrolling.<br>
<br>
Pressing phys_swap after rapidfire lastinv is only a 50% chance of actually bringing the gravgun up, because when spinning the wheel, theres no way to be sure that im actually on gravgun when its time to mess up someone cooking a nade, catch / pickup a prop or yoyo an orb- i could just as easily be on whatever weapon im madly lastinving to/from.

Regarding mention of "cheap"- theres no such thing. Either youre within the limitations of the game or youre not. Theres no inbetween here, since the difference between some ingame technique and a hack / dll edit / file swap is crystal clear. Players whining about rpg-vent speecrawling, crouch spamming, [insert technique here] etc, are just causing themselves grief over something they should instead be learning to combat, and do themselves.<br>
<br>
As for the mousewheel... its been in gaming for over a decade now, and isnt leaving anytime soon. Might as well put it to good use!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have weapon_physcannon bound on my keyboard, if I want to switch the physcannon I do so with the keyboard, if I need to scroll I do it with the mouse wheel. <br>

Is it cheap yeah, maybe it is but who cares so is killing spawners, or using the rocket. I personally back in the day attempted to have scrolling removed from the game the entire exploit but valve did not see it my way. So I say whatever they implemented in the current code is how they meant for the game to be played. They specifically took extra time to code the game to make sure that fast orbs and various other physics cannon exploits where left in when with a single line of code they could have taken it out. I personally think the cheapest tactic in the game is fast balls. So basically if valve left it in the game and as you say it can be done in the gui and without any modifications I can't see any reason why not to use it. If you start messing around in the console or bringing in modified files then the lines start getting blurry. But anything you can do with a commonly acceptable mouse and keyboard is fair game unless a league or server makes a rule against it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, personally I avoid doing things which would commonly be against the rules in leagues. According to Valve scripting is fine, but I don't use mag zoom or catch scripts, e.g. Just like a try to avoid brightskins even if some tournaments allow them...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well, here is where a mouse with 2 thumb buttons would be helpful. I didn't put crouch on my mouse but instead added sprint. I just recently moved my grav gun from "F" to my other thumb button (MB4 close to the tip of my thumb) and put "use" in it's place, at F. I tried putting grav gun on scroll but found myself scrolling 2 clicks and changing back to another weapon... blah! Overall scroll just didn't feel right to me for that so I opted not to do it. So if you were to do that I'd suggest not using the grav gun bind that switches back to another weapon... but that's a whole nother issue.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, I think it's simply how you can abuse crouch by hitting it repeatedly in order to achieve a few things...<br>

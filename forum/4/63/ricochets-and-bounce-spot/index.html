	<div class="content">In most maps there are plenty of usefull ricochet to be found. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">RICOCHETS:</span> a ricochet is done by firing xbow at angle on a solid surface such as a concrete ceiling wall or floor (and much more but you get the point) <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">BOUNCE:</span> Bounces, or Orb Ricochet works exactly like xbow ricochet's but with an orb instead.<br>
<br>
Technique: every bounce/ricochet has a start point and a destination point.<br>
note that orbs are tricky and its tough to go for a precision shot but they cover  more space and are deadly while xbow ricochets require precision.<br>
<br>
Now, what i'm suggesting here. whenever you find a ricochet that you think would be useful, no matter how popular how simple it is good as long as its not posted here, no matter how obvious/easy/hard this shot is.<br>
<br>
Way to do it should look like this:<br>
<br>
1)Hi this ricochet is done on dm_lostvillage and it works like this (short desc)<br>
<br>
2)*pic of starting point* (your crosshair will be exactly where the person has to shoot and a short description on where to stand) to host your pictures i recomand photobucket.<br>
<br>
3)*pic of destination point* Where will it land and in wich situation its good to use this ricochet..<br>
<br>
i'll post some as soon as i get back home, have fun studying the maps you like the most be original and creative <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what he means was if you shoot the elevator at an angle (in order to get a rebound off its surface) instead of bouncing back up, the orb will stay at elevator level (player model  knee-level) instead of gaining or losing height. but yea screenie/demo would be nice</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

While you are entitled to your opinion and I generally dislike censorship, I would like to ask you to please save such negative statements for other forums.<br>
<br>
It is nothing personal and while most people here probably wont even care, I don't want threads to turn into pointless flame wars, and I want all players to feel comfortable posting tips and techniques here without feeling like their style of play is looked down upon.<br>
<br>
There is a note on this in the forum guidelines:<br>

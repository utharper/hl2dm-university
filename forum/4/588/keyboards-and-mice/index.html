Buy an extra set of everglide feet as once the stock ones wear out you'll start scraping the bottom of your mouse, as soon as that happens stick the everglide ones on. I found that doubling the feet up works a lot better as well. it used to feel like i permanently had a few grains of salt on my mouse mat (annoying gritty noise)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Now if only Logitech had a decent USB keyboard with some media controls on it. Got a Media600 and it's basically a PS2 board with a USB plug <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>

Eh at the laptop keyboard. But I did like the G5 with exactmat. Had no problems with the G5 other than it died. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, here's a tip I got from my father who's actually partially computer illiterate. If you're not affraid to disect your keyboard partially you can use graphite powder to give new life to sticky keys. Oil is relatively ineffective on plastics but the graphite powder adds lubrication heavily spammed keys like wasd.<br>
<br>
As for the mice... my razor Lachesis has Teflon pads and I'm hoping they don't wear too much... had it for about 2 months and haven't noticed anything more than a little scuffing. I've seen aftermarket wearpads in some online mousepad stores but I don't think that the Lachesis ones are removed easily without taking the mouse apart...Yikes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

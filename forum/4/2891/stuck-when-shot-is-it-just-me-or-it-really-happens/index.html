	<div class="content">Sometimes when I get hit, I get pushed by the shot. Well, I guess that depending on the weapon fired, that may be normal.<br>
But, did it ever happened to any of you that when you have (i.e) 3 enemies firing at you at the same time, from "all" sides, you cannot move?<br>
This happens a lot with Ar2, SMg's and Shotties, if all are fired at the right times.<br>
<br>
I see the same happening to many ppl, and they never seem to get stuck in the crossfire... or maybe it's only my point-of-view's impression.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well works in the way it works in the real world when multipule forces acting on a object are opposite angle to each other it causes a state of equlimbrum on the object (stays in on place). Most of the time due to bhop your feet are off the ground and thoes shots will cancel your momentum in the air since your still in the the air you have can't apply a force to move untill you feet are on the ground. Thats why you can't move a short fraction of a time when you are shot which is to be expected.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I see your point. But I could swear that it happened to me when I jumped (yes) but then I had already my feet on the ground. As I was being shot from multyple directions I could not move in any, but I had my feet on the ground already (I deliberatly released CTRL and stoped jumping). All this took like 2 seconds, at most, untill I died to a shottie.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to be sure that it's not a bug and that other ppl had already experienced it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have never had this happen. I'am sure its quite possible. But i mean 3 shotguners. You dead anyhow if there close enough to create an equal force to freeze you there. I'am thinking you best option is 357 all of them lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think they were 3 shotties, or maybe 2 shotties and an Ar2. Something like that. I think it's possible too. It just happens so many times that I became suspicious of either my connection lacking the receiving/sending of info or that it could be a bug like when you fly with a barrel, sometimes you stop in mid air when you throw it, sometimes you don't.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have had this happen a few times it is rare though and probably part of the game due to the push of the bullets.<br>
AR2 has a lot of push mag has even more, mag shots stop you dead in your tracks if bunny hopping.<br>

What SND was trying to say was.<br>
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Theres also some fucked up lag shit hapening here as well.<br>
If ur being shot by one or more lagers, their fire can warp your player postion, making movement impossible, hapens to me all the time, but i lag, so it doesnt even have to be a lager shooting me, and can be just one person with an smg at times.<br>
Its like, wen u see someone with 800 ping walk into a room, u jump around the corner, and pump them full of lead, sometimes they just obsorb the bullets, being the lagers that they are, so then u go back around the corner, and all of a sudden u warp back into the room and u are dead, cause that whole time the lager was shooting u it just didnt apear on ur screen yet, etc<br>
It sux.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

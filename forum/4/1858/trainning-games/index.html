	<div class="content">Apart from doing scrims with your m8 and 1v1 what else do u do with m8 to refine your skills and hone your techniques to perfection. I do this with training games and so though it would be a good idea to list down what sort of training games u guys do.<br>
<span style="color:#00BF40"><br>
lockdown footie</span>. get a team m8 and be on the same team so your don't kill each other. Now at back mag one stands at the end where the orbs spawn and the other at the other end near the fan. Both arm your selfs with ar2s it might be a good idea to puts cheats on so u can type impulse 101 so u don't have to keep pausing. Now the goal of he game is to get your orb past your m8 and hit the back wall to score. If you crush your m8 then double points <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">. Try catching and moving at the same time then speed things up with just grav gun blasts and try and get a rally going. So as u go and u get better at it then try and make it harder by fast orbing and shotting the orb at unpredictable angles floor sidewalls and ceiling. Still to easy then play as opposite teams and see how many times you can kill your opponent. <br>
<span style="color:#FF0000">Rules are:</span> only one orb can be in play <br>
              orbs should be in reachable height <br>
Next level i would say is using props have fun playing that <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#00BF40">Magnum aim practice</span>. A good map to practice crossbow shots at different distances. Have one standing ontop floor with the crossbow and have some at the first floor at the opposite end preferable have some that can move well. Now they are you target their job is to along the platform. Depending on how good u are at using the crossbow ill start from easy to harder. First is having them walk back and forth then sprinting across then bhopping then a target that moves in unpredictable ways(jumping back forwards basically they trying not to be hit). After that have the target moving run around the bottom of the map now its much harder u don't have them in visible view most of the time and the are not always at the same distance.<br>
<br>
ill add to this latter but feel free to add some more training games if u know any.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yea I used to do that when i got new headphones.<br>
<br>
Another one would be play cat and mouse. One player has a stunstick and the other trying and the other trys and gets away with out dieing. The purpose of this is develop better movement under pressure. This is great to so to develop survival instincts and knowledge of a map. If u get hit try picking up heath and suit. Also the attacker learns skills as well with getting a faster bhop but also learn evasive tactics when it comes down to chasing opponent don't always follow behind them on their same route learn ways to cut them off and out smart them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also, that second level of Style Jumps has been really good training lately.<br>

I also spend some time bunnyhopping around on a create server, into walls and corners and going backwards.<br>

Another one here. I usually play with sound low cuz I play at night and everyone's sleeping. During the day when I turn sound up I get a little confused and aim worse.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked">

Are there jump training maps other than ptrain available for download?<br>
Cuz I've seen Onty's videos on Youtube and he has some fabulous maps. ptrain is all "1 room, 1 jump" and is poor in practical terms, I believe...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

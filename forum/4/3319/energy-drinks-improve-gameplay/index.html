So does the extra caffeine help improve reflexes or am I crazy and should stop playing DM? Lol, does anyone else have the same experience?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Heh, heh! Well see the first time I did it, I was casually drinking, and I thought I noticed a difference then I payed attention while drinking one. So i'm not sure if its all mind games.

	<div class="content">Energy drinks can boost you up a bit to where you are more aware and responsive to in game situations. I used to drink them quite often, and I would notice a slight improvement in my game play. The thing is though they are not really good for you, and I wouldn't advise drinking them on a daily basis. Most of them are full of sugar and too much caffeine ends up disrupting your sleep which can lead to other problems.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

that contradicts something i saw down at the science museum recently, there was this  time-your-reactions thing there, alongside was a blurb that mentioned the fact that caffeine does NOT enhance your reaction time, only makes the reaction more "forceful".</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Caffeine is the last thing i want in a competitive gaming situation. A minimal to negligible reflex improvement (generally only noticable if the user is low on quality sleep and/or calories to begin with) and slightly better focus doesnt anywhere near make up for the general twitchiness, random jitter-induced harsh overreactions and the inevitable crash once the drink or whatever wears out.<br>
<br>
Also, increased focus can alternately be gained via a meditative state (aka flow, the zone, [insert preferred synonym here]) with potentially far stronger and more reliable / longer lasting results (though, i suppose if a competitor were the type to cheat online, or were just a lazy player in general, theyd probably be no more likely to have the discipline to aquire the above techniques than they did to properly learn the game in the first place, and come lan time might as well just cram a load of kola nuts up their butt and hope for the best).<br>
<br>
Overall im of the opinion that energy drinks and the like are much like "gaming keyboards", mice with on the fly sensetivity adjustments and the like- marketed as pro, but essentially gimmicks and only actually of interest to / used by the lesser players who will likely never be pro, or reach that level; the pros themselves may endorse this stuff (mainly since they get paid to do so) but dont actually appear to use it when theres a title or sizable purse on the line.<br>
<br>
And with that said: Can anyone give example of a serious major esports tournament (meaning, skill intensive game, lan play, reasonable amount of cash / swag / respect to be had) where the top player(s) were seen consuming loads of trash calories / caffeine immediately prior to taking the championship? Ive watched quite a few quakecon / evo / etc finals and the like, and as of yet have never seen this occur once.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

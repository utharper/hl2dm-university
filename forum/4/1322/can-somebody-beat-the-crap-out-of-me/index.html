	<div class="content">Seriously.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not the best at anything - except perhaps snoring <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
But I do consider myself an excellent hl2dm player.<br>
<br>
I do not perform any of the "advanced movements", or if I do it's completely by mistake.<br>
<br>
What I want to do is play somebody 1v1 (which I also suck at), with demos from both sides, or even SourceTV.  I want to really see what the differences are between my style of play and somebody with advanced movement.<br>
<br>
My home is dm_killbox_kbh_2, so I'd prefer at least one game in there, but also lockdown/overwatch/ whatever.  All stock settings, no funny gravity or anything like that.<br>
<br>
I want to learn as much as I can so I can ensure that the mod I'm working on will have the right "feel" and movement abilities.<br>
<br>
Thanks to whoever wants to help me out with this!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Beasley decided he wanted more traffic.  We have a US and EURO server that is KBH_2, so he decided to go with stock maps.  For us, its fun and different.  People who come, for the most part, know that we just goof off and don't take the game seriously so it's fun.  But I think it will be a permanent change for his server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Played cyb3r last night.  Got my a$$ creamed on LD.<br>
<br>
But got my revenge on kbh_2 ...<br>
<br>
Two things that really stood out in my demos:<br>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>Aim is key in the box.  Advanced movement just doesn't help that much.</li>
<li>Movement is everything in "stock" maps</li></ol>

I know aim is generally a good thing  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed">, but it seems the times I've played stock maps, splash damage and orbs seem to be the quick kill techniques.  I also noticed that I just couldn't seem to aim in lockdown.  For some reason I physically played differently on both maps.  Movement also seems to be the key to get your health and charger updated quickly, as well as getting away from me  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
But in the box, I rely on the xbow and some mag to do my dirty work.  The advanced movement almost makes you an easier target for my xbow.<br>
<br>
So what I got from my first round is that movement is key to getting health/armor/items, but doesn't always give you the upper hand.  With my slow, non advanced movement, it was really hard to play lockdown ( and what is with the jittery movement outside the shower area on _r3? ).<br>
<br>
I will say, knowing the map inside and out definitely gives you an advantage.<br>
<br>
I will play more to see what other advantages/disadvantages i can find with the advanced movement.<br>
<br>
I do have a question, do props cause a lot of problems with advanced movements?  Do you find yourself at a dead stop because a radiator or saw blade is on the ground?  Does it launch you in the wrong direction?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="msg">
	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">It's most likely like most killbox players that your sensitivity is too low. In a killbox you nearly always have very large distances between yourself and your opponent so you would desire a lower sensitivity or at least alter the way you aim to deal with that large distance. In a smaller map like lockdown you need quick reflexes in short distances unlike killbox a guy surprising you around the corner is common. If your aim is really good it won't matter if it is splash damage or orbs or mags or shotguns they all kill pretty fast. The only exception is the xbow since it has no head shot damage in a 1v1 it is not as usefull for direct hits unless you are really good with it. Cause the guy is going to have armor and basically absorb the first hit. The more players present the stronger the xbow becomes as they have less chance to be stocked with armor.<br>
<br>
Knowing the map inside and out does give you an advantage but that is true of all maps, anytime I drop into a killbox it is rough to start but by the end of the map I usually have found enough mags and armor to turn the game around. <br>
<br>
Yes if your movement sucks a player can basically toy with you he can come in with 100/200, shoot you several times and if you get him low he can just run away and you aren't fast enough to catch him and finish him. Then he has plenty of time to run around and restock and come back and try again. <br>

Thats not entirely true.. yes aim is improtant in boxes but a fast movement is everything. Does happen often in a box 1v1 that i get hit 4 times with 357 some shotgun hits and then kill him with the stick.. just because i move fast and fill up my hp/suit all the time. And for the stock maps a good movement is only usefull in 1v1 as soon as its a 2v2 or a pub its nearly useless. I get owned from non bunnyhoppers or crap movers all the time lol just because i try to move fastest and they are just sneaky  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> btw when is our kbh session?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I did fairly well in lockdown but Keeper WHOOPED my ass in KBH2. I don't know how but man I was dead faster than I could spawn. I think (anyone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) but Keeper should familiarize himself with more 1 v 1 maps, such as Lockdown, Lost Village, etc. And learn the weapons layout and such. Keeper, in all honesty, I feel  I have good to advancement movement...but I really suck at 1 v 1 so I don't think movement is a key in "stock maps" but more of knowing the in-and-outs. Most of the maps I dominate in pubs are because I get a feel of where players are going to go. I think if I apply this in 1 v 1 in might help me and then maybe I can show you what I mean.<br>
<br>
Also would love to play you in KBH 2 again, never had so much fun getting my ass kicked. Just hopefully I can do better!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Each "normal DM" (I don't like to call the non-killbox maps stock cause some people mistake that for default, non-custom) map has different weapons to whore, I guess. For Lostarena, I find the two SMG nades key with Magnum being the second most important weapon. In Lockdown, it's definitely orbs and nades. For Overwatch, the RPG, Magnum, Crossbow, and SMG Nades are all useful, it's just a matter of where and when you get them to start dominating the map with ease. I find that in most killboxes, the weapons are laid out and generally easy to get, providing a more even-sided battle at all times rather than a weapon/item-resource controlled one. With the killbox's sheer size, you really want to get good at sniping.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, 2fort_b8d practices spamming and sniping (still no resource controlling). <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

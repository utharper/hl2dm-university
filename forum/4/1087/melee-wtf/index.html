	<div class="content">Melee is often overlooked, I know I don't usually use it, but its quite a good tactic in certain situations, rocket being one of them. As I've stated before, use whatever weapon fits the situation, with absolutely no thought whatsoever as to whether its "lame" or not. If your running at someone who has full hp/armor with a stunstick thats either stupid or not trying, and i do consider not trying/giving up to be lame. but if theyve got rocket and you think they will suicide, blah blah... then by all means lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you kill with it you aren't cocky, you just take your opponent by surprise.<br>
There's a guy in our clan that loooooves it.  His #1 weapon: (<strong class="text-strong">stunstick:</strong> K:3164;D:482 )<br>

People just don't know how to counter it.  If they've got the RPG then they are<br>
going to jihad or die by the stick.  I don't move worth a crap, but some of you<br>
guys who do can really piss people off with the melee.  I can see why some<br>
would think it's cocky, but they are wrong.  It's a good tactic IMO.<br>

<br>
Exactly and it's hard to whine about 1 weapon and not whine about the others. I personally hate combine balls especially when people whore them out. But I just yell and cuss at my computer screen and get over it. Some people also only use the smg and it drives me nuts when I'm using everything in my arsenal to kill someone who just stands there. I used to HATE the rpg like some people but then if I bitch about every weapon how are they supposed to kill me? Just tell them to not use any weapons? lol I just get over and every weapon was put in the game for a reason. If it's in the game it's fair to use.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The problem is that most people can't stand dying with meele, and get mad.

	<div class="content">Heh good choice for a bump Impala, I love the crowbar.  Yeah usually people think your trying to prove something when you kill them wiht the crowbar.  They see it as saying, "I pwn you so hard I don't even need to use a gun!" instead of a just a finishing tactic.  I try to use it as much as I can without putting myself in situations such as the one Impala described.  using the crowbar has helped me a lot with movement during firefights.

<br>
@ Impala  The rpg steal with the stick is always rewarding.  I enjoy jumping on top of peoples head so they stop moving and just pounding them into the ground as they try and figure out why they stopped. ahahaha  <br>

It would be fun to get so good with the crowbar that your able to knock props that have been thrown at you out of the air.  To then rush and crush their bum, all with only the mighty crowbar, weapon of ultimate domination.  That would be pretty intimidating to see a dude advancing on you knocking all the props you throw away with his crowbar instead of gg.  ahahah even more leet, I want to hit someones thrown nade back at them with the crowbar...that would be amazing. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

My all time fav that I ever did with the crowbar involved staulking someone for a while and some creative sound effects.  So I was trying to follow this guy without him noticing, and got I kinda bored enventually. (he was REALLY easy to follow)  So I decided to start making the jaws sound (dun dun....dun dun....dun dun) as I was folowing him and as i got closer I would speed up the sound like in Jaws. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  Then as I attacked him I did a building climax and then started in to the horror movie "Reee-Reee-Reee-Reee-Reee" as I whacked him with my crowbar.  The funniest part was how his playing changed as the jaws sound got faster, he knew I was getting closer and started to play more franticly. Bahahahah I AM JAWS FEAR ME! rofl <br>
<br>
It was totally Pubmasters intermission style with some added soundeffects.  Pubmasters is one of my favorite CS vids that can be found on youtube if you search for "pubmasters."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

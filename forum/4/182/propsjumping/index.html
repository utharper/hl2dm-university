	<div class="content">k well people been asking since i made a couple of vids how i jump so high with the objects.<br>
<br>
Ready?<br>
<br>
            ------------------------------<br>
The only props you can fully trust at 99% of launching you in the air are:<br>
<br>
+The square shaped grey heater<br>
<br>
+The thin white heater pipes<br>
<br>
+Sinks (lockdown bathroom for example)<br>
<br>
+Toilets<br>
              -------------------------<br>
<br>
Beside the above any other props tend to launch you only an inch in the air or you will might get hurt.<br>
<br>
The more polys the prop has, the better it is, that's why cabinets or crates rarely works.<br>
<br>
Toilets and sink will most likely throw you very high but you dont have much control on where you want to go since those props are pretty small and you can't run over them.<br>
<br>
Toilets and Sinks are good at going straight up, not far.<br>
<br>
They can be used, for example, to reach overwatch's RPG while gravjumping from the street.<br>
*****<br>
*****<br>
Heaters:<br>
<br>
Heaters rarely throw you damn high but they get the job done, sometime tho they can launch you as good as sinks or toilets.<br>
<br>
Heaters are badass because <br>
1) It's probably the best prop in the game considering it's<br>
<em class="text-italics"> damage // velocity // weight </em>ratio<br>
2)Since you can run over them you can decide of an angle or at least a direction you want to take during your jump.<br>
-------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Q: BUT CONFLICT HOW DO I JUMP WITH THEM ASDASDASDASD<br>
<br>
A: In order to do that properly, one must stand on the prop and <strong class="text-strong">LOOK STRAIGHT DOWN</strong> and make sure you stand on the prop "edge"...the side of the prop.<br>
<br>
Once you get that down try running over the props and look down at the right time to launch yourself.<br>
<br>
Shouldn't take more than an half an hour to get the hang of it.<br>
<br>
Several factors can affect grav jumping such as:<br>
<br>
Floor in angle.<br>
If you don't look TOTALLY down it might not work at all.<br>
If you crouch on the prop.<br>
Luck / BS<br>

Hope that helped!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what a coincidence, I have been lately practicing this technique since I found it useful and stylish  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool">  haha. <br>
I can't really say  "hey what I say it's right, and u have to do it that way !", however, im just gonna say the things I have find useful or have worked for me this past days - at least for me =P-<br>
<br>
-sometimes I do it better if I move the aim down just before doing it, instead if maybe already having it a little prepared, i know it must sound stupid, but, dont know, it has worked for me <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
-I think its better if u get nice speeds before doing it.<br>
-My most high jumps are usually with heavy stuff that you can't grab, for instance, cars. (they might damage you sometimes though)<br>
<br>
Finally, both this things were said by conflict by I completely agree with him, so   I'm gonna say them too:<br>
- LOOK STRAIGHTLY DOWN. otherwise u might not jump at all  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
-It also depends on luck, I mean its sometimes completely random =S<br>
<br>
If somebody finds this is true, a complete BS, or any new tip, please let us all know  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

	<div class="content">I managed to jump from the ground to the RPG in overwatch using the thin white heater, can't seem to get the hight from the other probs yet, but practise is the key.<br>
<br>
.conflict:<br>
how did you manage to jump from the white car to the roof in overwatch?<br>
<br>
do you jump and then fire?<br>
<br>
O/T: I noticed another thing in "thisismyvidlol" and thats when you fire the cabinet in lockdown you switch to AR2 and then back to GRAVGUN,are you boosting the speed/power of the object or something?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"> <br>

	<div class="content">I think rates also affect this. Try jumping with cl_updaterate 20, cl_cmdrate 30, and then try with cl_cmdrate 100 and cl_updaterate 100. At least for me, there is a big difference.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Please don't mess with your rates if you don't know what you are doing, or at least check/remember what you are currently using to change everything back to normal after trying this.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps^^, and please tell me if you also noticed any difference.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Grav Jumping is obsolete.. its all about orb jumping XD... or grave jumping becuase u might die half the time depending on how you do it. <br>
The table is a good one for this all you have to do is stand on the table.. shot the grab ur orb slide it under the table while u are still on it then shot it down and you go flying into there air.. if you didnt die, I have managed to touch the top of the sky box on overwatch. You can also do it with 3 cabinets but takes to much time to propare but at least you wont die half the time...<br>
<br>
I find the sink and toliet the best grav jumpers i get lots of vertical movement if i do it right. and no health dmg and if you do go straight up you can land on the side of the sink and you wont take fall dmg =o   most of the time lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

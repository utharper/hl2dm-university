it could probably be used for a more effective weapon, yeah! but it's good for rabbit punching (yo-yo-ing) while moving, don't forget I'm still learning so if you've got a better suggest let me know <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></span><br>

it's all what you get use to<br>
<br>
and jelly is w crowbar or slot1 ?<br>
<br>
i find slot1 slot3 and slot 5 to be easier then having these 3 buttons be 7 buttons , but thats me, because i only need to pull out the 357/xbow/shotgun on the fly  , althou slot1 is still straight to the crowbar/stunstick and if i need a nade i must not have any other weapons so it goes striaight to it.<br>
<br>
SMG/AR2 is easy enough to toggle threw and a quick double press lets me know how many smg_nades/CBs i have<br>
<br>
<br>
althou jelly has moved his movement keys so he has more buttons to use on the keyboard.  Just a thought, i switched it up like this so i could move some movement keys to a better place for me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Read the course. It was written by me, and I scoured several clan websites looking for config info before writing it. I tried to compile the most logical config I could based on all the info I had about advanced play and reducing reaction time.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/hl2dm_102.htm" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/hl2dm_102.htm</a><br>
<br>
I am happy to change it if you can give me logical reasons for why those positions are bad. M3 for use is actually very smooth. For example, you can strafe jump towards a door and hit use to open it all without taking your fingers off any of your movement keys. You also have full access to all movement keys while charging. If you use default "E" for use, you cannot strafe right without moving your finger back first. The only reason I can think of for not putting it on M3 is that you might want to use your mouse wheel for some other purpose.<br>
<br>
1 is not so far away when it's a direct bind with fastswitch on. How many pistol kills are you getting in a real match anyway?<br>
<br>
The course recommends slot 1 with fast switch for melee, which Jelly likely has. Why not use W if it's free and your movement keys are ESDF? Melee is one of the weapons you absolutely need to be able to draw quickly if you are going to use it at all. The course assumes you have either a standard mouse, or a mouse with only the extra thumb button. If you have more you can put it on your mouse, just bear in mind that if you ever play in a competition where you are not allowed to bind those extra buttons, you might be screwed. This config is written with that in mind.<br>

	<div class="content">Ok, I do have logical reasons for why W should not be crowbar around that config.<br>
<br>
Please tell me when you are going get close enough to use a crowbar against a good player. Considing pistol does 29 damage for headshot and you can use it farther away. That's 4 more dmg than crowbar and a lot more lenghth.<br>
<br>
That use idea is actually very very good idea. I'm too use to E though.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> 1 is not so far away when it's a direct bind with fastswitch on. How many pistol kills are you getting in a real match anyway?  </div></blockquote>

You'd be suprised when you hit someone almost directly with a nade and they are too far for SMG. Plus, I'm just not a big fan of SMG in general...a perference for me...I would also like to see how many melee kills you get! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
I just don't see a point for melee in a scrim.<br>
<br>
About Jelly Fox, I don't see why pistol is all the way at 1 when X is open. I think RPG is too far away too.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> Melee is one of the weapons you absolutely need to be able to draw quickly if you are going to use it at all </div></blockquote>

I don't see why anyone would use melee if it isn't for fun.<br>

Strafing is basically just sidestepping to the left or the right. Default keyboard settings has A as left strafe and D as right strafe.<br>
These keys are powerful when you combime them with sprint and jump, so learn them well <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">A note about key setups. <br>
<br>
I have changed mine multiple times. It really is not as hard as people make it out to be, I would do it after the end of a season or the beginning of a season rather then before playoffs but you can do it and it is worth it. I suggest not being afraid to move your config around for other reasons. For one it teaches you a skill, how to learn something, some of your decade old gamers who have never moved your config have also not learned to learn in a decade either. You do things 100% without thinking or trying because you have done it so long and in fact you may have never learned how to increase your skill at something quickly. Second I have seen players who are real good like conflict change their config around and become a monster like LukeGT421. The point was that for a long time they were hitting a glass ceiling based on their config. And getting things set up right raised the bar and unleashed them to achieve their full potential. It did take about a month for them to get back to where they were, but in an extra month they were well past that. <br>
<br>
Anyone can be pretty good at the game with literally any setup. The problem is they will have weakness in certain situations because they either cannot do some key stroke, it takes them longer, or it inhibits them from doing something else while they are doing it. <br>
<br>
Here is an example: When I am charging I must move my index finger off of right strafe and so I cannot strafe left and right to minimize the chance of a headshot from someone who heard me charging. So I work around this by moving my middle finger down to right strafe. Then when I am done or interrupted I need to replace my fingers to the right keys. If I am not in good practice I will mess this up and usually get killed. Perhaps end up on the wrong keys or just not move quick enough. This is probably not worth moving my keyboard config around for but for other people something much more important could be inhibited. Something they may need to do constantly. <br>
<br>
The problem with the Arrow keys is that they have a whole bunch of dead space and large keys near them. This means that you are limited in the number of keys you can press quickly. Currently I run an ESDF config, previously I ran an RDFG config but due to crap keyboard problems I had to move closer to the alt keys. The main point is if you have more keys with in quick reaching distance of your finger you will be able to do more tasks with binds and do them quicker. Perhaps some time later I will write up a more in depth look at how to design a keyboard layout and why you would place things in some area. <br>
<br>
This is my current config

Actually I made the change to WASD after my last CAL season, I'm very impressed and glad by the results, it was hard the first week as I couldn't pull out a nade from my pocket while walking through a door at the same time.I had to concentrate on my fingers dealing with 2389407 keys, wich isnt the case of arrows since you have huge gaps all over the place.<br>
<br>
Changing the config around is indeed a really good thing, Lets say you play with WASD, why the hell should I let the scoreboard clogging my TAB key. My scoreboard is`bound to K, damn far from anything useful, i rarely check the scoreboard when i'm in a rush with an orb flying all over the place <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> I felt a huge difference in the way i play and the way i move since i changed my config, i can bunnyhop way faster and jump considerable distance. I'm not saying its bad, I was learning way faster and easier when i was using arrows since I couldnt rely on anything else but being creative and using the maximum of my knowledge. But now it's a different playstyle relying on speed (weapon and movement) and alot of more things but, the way the game is played really changes depending on what you can and cannot do, and that, in my case, was determined by the config. <br>
<br>
I'm still looking for a comfy spot to place my gravgun, i was used for it to be on mouse`s thumb button and now i switched it to F, and now sprint (wich used to be on NUM_0 is now on mouse thumb button). In other words, yea like Fearsome* said ;p</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Might sound ignorant, but has the screen resolution any effect on mouse sensitivity? I think I recall being told that but never felt a big difference. =/<br>

This is my new config. I'll explain after:<br>

Now for the rant:<br>
I’m using an mx518 with my middle finger resting on the wheel and my thumb in the groove below the shoulder buttons. Switching from the two finger to three finger grip was a bitch, but now I got it down and I love it. I switched my secondary fire to the shoulder because crouch is really a lot more important and needs to be held down continuously, plus I wanted to keep my keyboard fingers open. I also had to bind my weapons for the first time because I wanted to move jump to the mouse and I decided on the scroll wheel. BTW, take it from me, scroll jumping kicks ass and is taking my bhop to a whole nother level. <br>
<br>
My left hand's home position is as follows-<br>
pinky-z-ggun (that's the weapon bind, not phys-swap)<br>
ring-d-left<br>
middle-r-up (screw you I still hold it down when I'm hopping)<br>
pointer-g-right<br>
thumb-space-sprint<br>
<br>
My pinky does most of the reaching on the right side. Binds are turning out pretty good; the only ones that are slightly still awkward are slam(c) and crowbar(caps).<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
way better jumping<br>
better grav gun response, faster orbs<br>
Cons:<br>
I don't get to scroll through my weapons and see what I picked up<br>

As for Zoom, I hardly ever zoom so I might swap RPG with one of them, I find 5 the easiest to press with my index finger which is why it's set to toggle_zoom.<br>

Thinking about it, I might move:<br>
<br>
Tab or 5 = RPG<br>
Z = Scores<br>

and get rid of zoom... or maybe even make toggle_zoom = capslock, which would stop me from SHOUTING all the time as well.<br>

I had:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>bind "y" "timeleft;timeleft;timeleft"</code></pre></div>

so it displays it 3 times, so it doesn't get lost if people are chatting.<br>
<br>
or you can add it to TAB so every time you check the score it also displays the time left, like so:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>bind "TAB" "+showscores; timeleft"</code></pre></div>

I've just done that and moved my RPG to y, works a treat <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Any other thoughts I've had...well. Trying to make myself scroll down for jump... may take sprint off my mouse for that. Also, you'll find your index finger more dexerous and faster than ring and middle finger so I put a majority of my primary weapons surrounding it. My middle finger tends to post "w" as a place keeper even when depressed so reaching under and behind with my ring or index finger forces my hand to contort and lose place... for that reason I don't bind any keys to my ring finger except reload "Q" and my pinky stays planted on crouch most all the time "shift" for bhopping/speedskating so tab is left to score and caps lock is disabled because I hit it too often. z and x aren't used for the reason that I have to tuck fingers under my middle to get it.<br>
<br>
As an edit to this I've switched up my config as follows... First, I wanted to try moving my grav gun to my mouse 4 button to get that quicker on the draw while already having my keyboard hand moving to another weapon key, so with that I've moved "use" to the F key. Second, I changed my grenade to scroll down instead of mb3. It's just faster and basically the same. Also, I've had problems where in game I seem to be mashing MB3 and it doesn't even draw the nade... pain in the ass. I still have scroll up if I think the scroll down works for me... may move a primary weapon there also.<br>
<br>
Also, I wanted to give a heads up to G5 mousers. You may have had trouble setting your mouse buttons to stay configured in game. To overcome this I've set mouse buttons 4, 5, 6, and 7 to keystroke asignments in setpoint, such as, 7,8,9, and 0. This works out well to program your scroll left and right keys to stuff. I used mine like this. MB4 zoom, MB5 sprint, left scroll USE, right scroll reload, MB3 middle grenade. Having the middle button for those 3 never conflicted for me in game. FYI I now have a Razor Lachesis and the 2 buttons on the right side of the mouse are useless to me and disabled...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

get those separated from keyboard.<br>
have either one or the other. the way you are using it now gives u delay between the jump and the crouch ... which even being minimal, isn't good. Delay is never good <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
Some use sprint on the mouse, others use crouch. I personally use crouch with my mouse 4 (or 5 lol)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

get good before you reply to my post. thx.</div></blockquote>

naw Fearsome speaks the truth.<br>
I use rfdg and it worked fine on my old Dell keyboard and even my laptop keyboard.<br>
Then I just recently bought a decent gaming keyboard <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823224001&amp;nm_mc=OTC-Froogle&amp;cm_mmc=OTC-Froogle-_-Keyboards-_-ABS-_-23224001" class="postlink">ABS M1</a> and I find out I can't press r,g, and space at the same time.<br>
Long story short, my bhop is ruined until I remap my whole key config (which I use in every fps that I play now).<br>

	<div class="content">Dell actually makes pretty good free keyboards and kotao speaks the truth I have no problem spending money on things but the gaming keyboards have yet to sell me.<br>
<br>
Now lets clarify. Not all keyboards are made the same so particular key combos may work for one person and not the other. Most people do not even realize they are the victim of this keyboard flaw since the extra keys they want to press are weapon keys and they usually just think it was user error. So you may want to test your keyboard out if you notice that you thought you pressed something but nothing happened.  Some people just do not hit enough keys fast enough to notice and many do not even bunny hop. <br>
<br>
The reason that companies do not fix this problem is that most people do not need to press lots of keys all at the same time even in most games. For some reason valve always makes their games with tons of unintended exploits or advanced techniques which lead to the need to hold down various keys at the same time. If you think about what you need to do in an average game of HL2DM without scripts you must dedicate  a finger to 6 keys. So the chances you are going to be hitting some combo that won't work are higher then other games where it's mostly just movement and jump.  There are some groups of people who notice this problem though if you search you will find that blind people actually suffer they have to hit combinations of sdf and jkl to write braille and cannot do it on certain keyboards. <br>
<br>
One test that can get you a better keyboard is this. Pick the keys you plan to hit all the time and put fingers on them all. Then press them all down at once, repeat 4 times and press enter. Do that process 10 times. If your keyboard is capable you should have all the letters in each row forming perfect rectangle but the order of them will be somewhat random. Like this:<br>
<br>
sdlkfjsfldjksfldkjsdfjkl<br>
sdljkfljksdfdfslkjdfsljk<br>
ldksfjlsdfkjlskdjflsdfkj<br>
lsdkfjsdlfkjsdfljksdfklj<br>
skldfjsdfljkdsfkljsdfljk<br>
sldfjksdfljkdklsfjlsdfkj<br>
lsdfjkkljsdfkljsdfkjlsdf<br>
sdfjkldfskjlsdklfjsdfkjl<br>
dsflkjsdflkjklsdjfkljdsf<br>
skdjflsdfkljslfkdjlksjdf<br>
<br>
If your results look like below you have issues with your keyboard. And they can look alot worse than this too. <br>
<br>
sfdkljsdfjklsdfkljkljsdf<br>
sdfklksldfslfkdjsdflk<br>
sdfljksdfljksdfkjlsdfjkl<br>
sdfljksldfkjsfkldjsdfkjl<br>
sfldksfdljksfldjksdfjkl<br>
sdfjlksfjklsdfjlsdfjkl<br>
sdfjlklkjsdfkljsdfsdfklj<br>

sdfljklsfkdjskljfdsfkdlj<br>
sdfjkjklsdflsdfkjsdflkj<br>
sldjkfksldjsdfkljsdfkjl<br>
<br>
It is hard to make sure your keyboard works since this issue is rarely talked about in reviews or keyboard specs outside of some gaming keyboards.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

haha... at least you don't have a real bug in your monitor. I had this little corn mite trapped in my monitor for a couple of months, it used to crawl about and piss me off all the time, nothing I could do about it as he was trapped between the layers. I didn't want to squish it in case it made a mess so I just left it. now I have a little corn mite corpse trapped in my monitor, just in between the u &amp; m in forum. greeeeat  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Exactly. it's fucking grim. All he's done is added a couple of ramps here and there...he's hardly worthy of plastering his name all over it.<br>
<br>
Also noticed he's done the same to the orb_practise one, whose map was that originally? <br>
<br>
Did he even get permission off of the creators? <br>

Briggs, its your map would you be willing to make some changes to  it if we had suggestions?<br>
<br>
Anyone that has been through the map..Do you have suggestions?<br>
<br>
One major issue most of these maps have is one spawn point so when you get ten ppl on a server they all get stuck on that spawn point.  Its very annoying and not very useful.  You might have to expand the spawn area to accommodate more spawns.<br>

I would also get rid of the hole on the platform in the first room.  For someone trying to learn, you finally get over ther to fall through that hole and have to start over from the beginning...lol!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

thats not the end of it.<br>

i played, ultimatejumps_v2 i think it was called, and it had rips of dm_octagon's textures, and im not positive, but i assumed you didnt get permission from Swot.<br>
<br>
the map itself wasnt yours, but to take it, and retexture it with textures that arent even yours is pretty pathetic, and i hope that these maps are removed from the university server, endorsing this type of shit isn't going to help the community at all.<br>

mappers from any game map by a set of rules, and the number 1 rule is, if its not yours, dont fuck with it without permission. The decomp tool is for education purposes only, please dont abuse it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

is there some way of making votekick player_number dependent? since 2 is two little an number.<br>
<br>
for instance I was playing jumpstyle with 4 other players. 1 of them was trying it the other 2 were just up for killing. so myself and the other guy votekicked one of them, when he rejoined the 2 twats votekicked me.... and kept on doing it throughout the game  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/pointlaugh.gif" width="58" height="23" alt=":pointlaugh:" title="Tease"> pretty annoying!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I will try to play with the rtv and see if I can get it to be a percentage that will work with one person in the server and won't allow one person to take over. Not sure if I can get that to work but I will try.  I will also play with the vote kick.<br>

I also will be updating the version of mani and metamod source some time this week so if the server randomly restarts you know why.  I will try to warn anyone in ther ahead of time If I can.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

eidt:  i read something the other day about a map by singe?  multiple arena's that allow for people to pair up and duel each other with arena specific weapons.  haven't actually played it and may be too large for the server.  but sounded interesting.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well there's only two speeds... slow and fast... when you see an orb that comes out "faster", the speed doesn't change, it just left your gravity gun sooner because your timing was better..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The only thing is I have set rates, and when on the same server at the same time some players will seem to just be able to get one going faster then others. I know both are fast balls cause there is a huge difference between the fast and slow balls. But there are some players out there where I just find their balls are easier to catch and easier to track and see, where as others seem to just cruise faster then the average fast baller. And the difference can be seen when people just shoot them strait at you some guys seem to be able to sneak it through your grav fun better then others even on strait shots with no bounces and long distances.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Now when I think about it, it seems there could possibly be an influence from server tick rate since I assume the orb leaving the ar2 and the push from the grav gun have to be at least one tick apart, possibly 2 if the switch to grav gun has to occupy its own tick. Though this would only work if actual time influences orb speed rather than number of ticks.<br>
If this is the case I can see how low client fps also could be a limiting factor, potentially even more so if you have really bad frame rates.<br>
<br>
I dunno exactly how it works, but I'm sure some of you know of the trick where you fire an orb into the ground so you can push it on the return (requires good timing and a few tries). If you get it right the orb loses its speed almost entirely and either hovers in the air in front of you or will travel away slowly. The results are seldom exactly the same, suggesting this is not an on off thing, but that orb speed is quite variable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Theres only one orb speed above the standard firing speed from the ar2 (slowball), which is double speed (fastball). We tested this to conclusion with timers awhile back. There are plenty of slower than standard speeds, usually caused by deflecting an orb with ggun primary fire, or by an orb escaping its generator.<br>
<br>
Even back when you could scroll an orb 100 times before it got out of range, it still only moved twice as fast as a standard from-the-gun orb.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I would test/prove it again but I'm too lazy.<br>

Try the distance test as I mentioned earlier. Orbs are on a timer so in theory the faster they travel the further they go. If you can make a fast orb travel different distances you will prove it.<br>

  Lol, when I read your first post, I was like this guy must play killboxes...   Sorry to burst your bubble dude, there is only one speed above normal... fast.  No variations otherwise.  The issue you bring up about people not being able to catch it because it's too fast..  just bad timing, nothing more.  The bounces you bring up...  it's all in your head, it just looks faster than fast, cause it's fuckin fasT!!!!  There is such a small timing window for firing fastballs, anywhere in the strip will give you the same result.  Although!  WT, your test is 'slightly' off.  If you did test the way you mentioned, there would be about a foot or two gap in between some of the fastballs.  The ball expiration timer starts the second you hit the ball.  When firing a fast orb, you can fire one where the ball is 'basically' behind the discharge on the ggun itself, and you can also fastball about 2 feet ahead of yourself, so there could be a minor gap. (Again, if only one person does this test, they've most likely been fast balling for so long, all of their tests may come up exactly the same, cause they have good timing) But in general, the tests would come up very close to each other and prove that people in killboxes just see this game a hair differently...

	<div class="content">A lot of valid points here.<br>
 To me I too also see 2 speeds of fast and I'm not a killbox player.<br>
I see my own orbs go at 2 speeds of fast and in my head it comes down to timing the punch. As Dingle said there is such a small window of timing its gotta come down to a milliseconds difference, between when the orb leaves the gun and when it gets punched. The fastest speed I see only happens when I have really mashed the keyboard hard and fast. Most the time I see the (slower) fast speed, and my method is by using "use_weapon_physcannon" for my grav gun bind.<br>
<br>
Back before the sv_allow_wait_command 0, I felt like most of the people who were very consistent with fast balls (not everyone, but I bet a lot) were likely using a small script that was very easy to write.  Once the wait command came out, I saw all kinds of people having trouble fastballing becuz they had been doing it the easy way. Now it seems that there is more variance in the way people are doing it with out the script.<br>
<br>
Awhile back I read a post in here where Ko-Tao talked about binding mouse scroll wheel click to "use_weapon_physcannon" and mouse wheel up to +attack. I found this to be a very interesting idea, in fact it makes perfect sense to be able to complete an action that requires 2 key presses in one motion without a script. Well guess what, when I do fast balls in that manner I see the faster speed of fast ball 8/10 times on average. I still use the regular way of fastballing as I use mouse wheel tilt right and left for direct weapon binds (these are more important to me to keep basically) and its very often that I would inadvertently switch to one of those weapons after doing it and that was bad in a orb fight. For someone not using tilt, this has to be the way some people seem to be able to do the faster speed more often. either that or they have super human reflexs and possibly shorter distances from the brain to the fingertips (lower ping <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> )<br>
<br>
edit: I forgot to add that I talked to the all time orb whore *cough tarkan cough* about this and he said, he has only seen one speed of fast. This leads me to believe that even though he has prolly fired more obs than all of us combined, he is always seeing the fast fast ball or the normal speed fast ball every time. While its always possible that something like high FPS and a better connection may allow you to see the real speed, its weird some of us can see both speeds of fast.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Actually the more people who can confirm they see it helps us that also see it, not feel like were crazy or just seeing things. I find it real odd that some of the real long time players are so adamant about it not being possible to have more than one speed of fast. It makes me think they just have never been able to punch it fast enough to make it happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well I have seen what I thought looked like different speeds many times, but actual testing proved it to be either a trick of perception, or some weird phenomenon relating to lag.<br>
<br>
It's a bit like some of the bug testing I have done. I was certain something was a certain way until I tested it in a controlled manner.<br>

	<div class="content">I found a killbox where if you stand against a wall and fire a slow orb, it will travel exactly to the opposing wall and expire just as it hits it. When you fire a fast orb it returns and expires right as it hits the wall you are standing at. Map is dm_killbox_ultimate.<br>
<br>
A couple interesting things I found:<br>
<br>
It may have to something to do with the messed up animation you see of the ar2 after you fire one orb. <br>
When you pull the ar2 back out a second time and the ar2 acts like it wants to spit out another orb without you pushing fire. <br>
<br>
For some reason I see this messed up animation / action every single time I am on a dedicated server and fire a orb. <br>
Secondly this messed up animation / action does not occur on a listen server.<br>
 Third thing is if you fire a orb fast or slow as fast as possible after the messed up animation / action the slow orb will even travel farther likewise with the fast orb. <br>
So this increased travel must indicate a faster speed, although it is hard to see the increased speed in this type of map.<br>
<br>
In other words when the slow orb traveled all the way across the map and hit the opposing wall it would expire right as it hit the wall, when I fired a second orb with the messed up animation / action, the slow orb would now bounce off the wall and return a distance about the equivalent of a blue dumpster, the fast ball had the same result. I did make a demo but its real long and Id need to edit it out just to show the relevant parts. Besides that Id like to get someone else in there to make sure they see the same thing and its not just client side.<br>
Further testing and demo coming soon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sounds similar to what Modal was saying, the timer starts when you hit it, so maybe the glitch is causing you to hit it later. <br>
<br>
Having said that, one blue dumpster length is not really far enough to call a different speed, at least not of any significance IMO when taken as a percentage over the total distance travelled. Would you agree? The visual difference I see when playing would seem to imply at least a 10 to 20% increase in total travel distance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree the extra distance doesn't seem like enough to equal the extra speed we sometimes see, but it does amount to something. So I guess I'm gonna have to try some more things, as when firing a slow orb I'm not hitting it, therefore the timer would not be reset, however you can still make it go further than normal if you see  a glitch (which I see everytime on a dedicated server). When I get a demo ready you will see that, and you will also see that punching it at the very last possible second before it gets too far away does not make it go further. I demo'd about 100 orb shots with variances in the timing of hitting it to come to these conclusions.<br>
<br>
Some might say wow who cares about this, but dammit now its bothering me,lol and Im sick(flu) and bored so I gots nothing better to do atm.<br>
<br>
One question for anyone who cares to answer:<br>
Does everyone see the ar2 glitch everytime as well, or only sometimes, or never?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">First off, I dont believe there are faster speeds of a speedball. I think what I've always noticed was that people can fire fastballs faster than most. It seems like that by the time you can recognize the sound of the altfire firing up its way too late even if you're a good distance from the player. Theres players that fire fast orb and its like ok I have an hour to grab this thing and theres other times where some l337 players seem to fire the orb faster. And I dont mean a faster speed.<br>
<br>
As for the AR2 sound Im pretty sure that other players cant hear it. I could be wrong though.<br>
<br>
Btw, I use phys_swap for collecting items faster.<br>
<br>
One more thing, I've seen people somehow silence orbs in their g-gun. Im not going to say who because I'm sure they'll be messaging me telling me not to say anything but I've seen it. They told me to stand at ar2 in bathroom on LD and next thing i know they're coming into the back with a combine ball in their g-gun and I never heard them coming.

Now that I've done it but have a hard time recreating it consistantly I have a lot of motivation to practice, which always makes practicing easier lol.

I have lastwep on Q and gg on mouse 5, so really the only part that would take some fanagling would be left turns, but that could be compensated for with some creative keystroke timing.  I just want to be able to do combine ball yoyo kills, they look so funny! ahahaha</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

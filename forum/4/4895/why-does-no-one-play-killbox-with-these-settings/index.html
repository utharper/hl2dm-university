	<div class="content">sv_gravity 400<br>
sv_friction 3<br>
sv_accelerate 20<br>
sv_airaccelerate 70000 (this is what is set in a server I know, read below. May not be needed such amount, I dunno)<br>
<br>
???<br>
<br>
Everyone (except in those noobish servers with 300 grav or less) plays with everything defauls except gravity. In my honest opinion, it makes up for a sitting ducks shoot out, in which aim has, most often than not, the final word. Everytime you spawn on the top, if you don't quickly kill whoever is pointing at you while you're going down, you often end up dead. And if you kill someone, chances are he'll spawn and nade you faster than you can gather health. And when he nades you, you often aren't agile enough to dodge it enough.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I don't indulge settings like the old EYE|BLOODYENGLAND server had (some of you may have known it), cuz they were super-mega-fast. I actualy liked EYE settings, but I admit it was a bit extreme. But these settings, well I think they are pretty adequate for the size of the maps. Even for smaller killboxes. I used to play with those settings a lot in a friend's server and I always thought that that was way cool. And I'm asking this question because I believe most ppl know that such changes in the gameplay can be done, but hardly anyone does them.<br>
<br>
Being able to not feel like a snail while going around the box, having the ability (or agility) to wonder around dodging ppls shots, not being held in the air for eternity after jumping by mistake or by a failed strafe jump, reaching 650 speed in a good bhop situation, gathering health and ammo or weapons quickly like if playing dm, were all reasons for me to always think that was how killboxes should be played.<br>
<br>
But even in leagues ppl play the sitting ducks game. What the eff... (that's the reason I didnt go into killbox leagues when I used to play them a lot)<br>
<br>

Just an observation here, but as long as settings are user definable, you will have any and every combination under the sun.  People like what they like and thats what they will do.  Welcome to the settings debate, we already went through it with the killbox vs stock arguement and well we know how that went....<br>
<br>
I personally hate killbox of any kind, shape or form and I most definately hate anything less than about 550 Gravity but thats me.  <br>
Yes hate is a strong word, but it is appropriate in my case.  Besides the rp and coop crap, the killbox and low grav has, in my opinion, ruined this game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yeah like reality did to tv and now it's what tv is all about and what everyone is into. like it? probably not. but that's times changing. deal with it.<br>
Fact: kb is the closest thing to quake which is where this game came from. that's for origins.<br>
Fact: no less skillful players play only kb. fact you don't know about them don't mean they don't exist.<br>
Fact: kb play is not league based therefore never needed clans, ego based social ranking systems or for people to agree on anything because it's FFA. quite the contrary to the league side of this game who tried to build a "community" and work together but never could. if anything, THAT's what ruined the game: note the use of the word "game" means "the <em class="text-italics">game</em> in the eyes of this so called <em class="text-italics">Community</em>". the game is not dead. your community is. kb has seen far less decrease in numbers than the league play side did. quite clearly.<br>
Fact: the majority or gamers world wide moved away from FPS type games and as a result this game shriveled. only natural that the smallest and weakest portion of the game took the most damage. blaming kb for this is wrong.<br>

If everyone around the world has moved away from FPS games, then why have MW2, and BFBC2 been such hits and why are people drueling over COD Black Ops and Metal of Honor coming out soon,   FPS games have hardly been diminished.  In fact CODMW and MW2 have popular DM modes, however objective based and coop FPS games are popular as well.  Hell they are even making FPS games for the Wii.   I would say that people have moved away from pure DM games more than anything else.<br>
<br>
Killbox and low grav is not the game that Valve originally created in HL2DM.  The fact that it is called DM which is a game mode started by Quake is irrelevant imo and it doesnt make kb the more correct game mode.  The game and the settings that Valve created is what attracted me to this game and is what kept me playing this game for 5+ years.  Not floating around an empty box in slo mo and being a sitting duck.  Yes there are skilled people in KB, I didnt say there wasnt.  I refuse to play that mode because I simply dont enjoy it one bit.  Sorry.<br>
<br>
It is my opinion and I am entitled to it just like everyone else around here.<br>
As for "dealing with it",  I really dont play this game anymore because of it.<br>
<br>
P.S. I dont watch TV anymore either because of how it is now.  Its boring as hell and I would rather do something else.<br>
<br>
In any case my main point was that you are going to have a hard time convincing the KB community to stick with one set of settings over any others just as the stock community couldnt convince the low grav people to stay with normal grav.  I am just finding a bit ironic and humorus that the kb community is now having this same discussion.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I do not think KB is anything like quake I played it plenty and I played quake. KB servers all run different settings which is the real reason they cannot run leagues even when we tried to run them the KB players could never agree and therefore most would not participate because it was not their own settings. By keeping each server separate on separate settings they ensure that they isolate themself from the rest of the players. That is why KB players never developed a lot of skill because they never aggregated on a single way to play where a large number of people could compete and drive the skill up plus due to the fact they are always in a single room many of the skills of player like prediction never need to be developed. I guess there could be some guys out there who are really good but I have been playing a long time and have never seen them period. Every competition myself or my clan have joined we have beat the people at their own game. Every killbox tournament I have ever seen was one by a person who was a regular league player as far back as I can remember. Granted I probably do not know all the tourneys that happened. If you ever try to challenge these so called hidden elite players in communities like killbox or skull shock it never seems to go over well and most of the time they back out or want you to agree to ridiculously unfair rules. Speaking of that I am pretty sure MotionK still has not recieved his money from the skull shock tourney where dirty dave ripped him or more appropriately me off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

there is no kb community. read my post dear.<br>

@ Fearsome with the different servers settings theory - who told you each and every server has its own settings? this is as realistic description of kb as para's floating in empty boxes depiction <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
no man, kb isn't doing leagues not because server settings. you will notice the majority of kb players play using only grav changed (tsgk, kbh).<br>

I think they may probably be refering to servers like that one. Otherwise they'd find less sitting-duckness. Nowadays I can't find one server with fast settings with people. Not that I love killbox or anything, I still prefer 1v1s on some dm map anytime, but once in a while I like a good kb fight, but such servers like TSGK and GTFO killbox servers are ridiculous...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well Val, I was in one of your servers once and went 50 to 2 sitting in a corner with the mag and RPG so while I do think there are <span style="text-decoration:underline">some</span> skilled players in KB, I do feel that the stronger skilled players are on the stock side.<br>
<br>
KB is faster if you have a rediculously high setting on the air accel.   The fact is that stock settings was the first HL2DM there was, planned or not.  It is the game that most of us started with.  The maps that Valve created (as bad as some of them are) were not KB maps, they were stock type maps, with stock settings. The maps that won Valves map competition were stock type maps.  Killbox came later when someone decided they didnt like getting pwned by the bhoppers and decided to make a shooting galllery instead.  Hell even quake, at least Q4 (which I have played) has more design and layout differences to the maps.  <br>
<br>
Of course with the exception of your creations, most KB are a rehash of the same damn map with the colors/textures changed and some different props here and there.  They are also mostly bland and rather unimaginitive.  I mean really, how many different ways can you make an empty box with a few bridges across it?   Rather boring imo.<br>
<br>
And yea I have to agree with Fear that there is no true KB community because they cant even agree on a suite of settings which as Fear points out has caused the failure of most attempts at competative KB leagues.  People have tried to do it, very few have succeeded.<br>
<br>
In any case stock is what I love and I just cant enjoy kb settings of any type, but its really all a moot point I suppose.<br>
<br>
BTW there is a lot more to FPS than DM type games, alot more so FPS=DM is not really fair to the genre.<br>
<br>
Anyway yea &lt;3 to you to  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

say kbx, variations of kbh are most played? Because the maps that won so many awards are not even close to top 25?
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Not floating around an empty box in slo mo and being a sitting duck."</div></blockquote> If you'd have read my group description and would have tried those 2 servers, you'd understand that that is exactly what i want to change! And it's not ONE set of settings, thats just an ideal example cus certain maps require certain settings, depending on height of map, strength/type of elevators for starters.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>By keeping each server separate on separate settings they ensure that they isolate themself from the rest of the players. That is why KB players never developed a lot of skill because they never aggregated on a single way to play where a large number of people could compete and drive the skill up plus due to the fact they are always in a single room many of the skills of player like prediction never need to be developed.</div></blockquote>
Diff settings (gravity at least) can only mean, for me, adaptability.. to overbouncing and air control to say the least. 600g scripters have no room here lol. But dont say bhop isnt needed. The map isnt just 1 ft square on horizontal and miles on vertical! And that shows how much kbx u've played, prediction plays a big part in all maps. Ive met the best players in kbx rather than in stock maps. Ive seen numerous tactics in kbx, you won't believe it. Entire philosophies can be built, regardless of map. And the air control seems to add another dimension, like kbx/arena are the real 3d. Those who dont agree should open up their mind, sry. You're just missing out <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
Maybe its the US kbx servers to blame for your ahem wrong opinions.. Yes mostly beginners play them and grav is way too low. Stop by our servers sometime..<br>
Idk the thing in US, but in Europe there's plenty of skillful players in kbx, matter of fact, some stock advanced players come down from time to time from their stock environment for some kbx fun and, well, when they start losing, they make up excuses like lag, shit grav, "you're only good at kbx" etc.. and leave. Lame, imo

Pretty much that.<br>
<br>

<br>
Now for the people that are saying that killboxes are just a sitting ducks target practice, thats' exactly why I started this thread for. To gather opinions about it, and hopefuly improving a server or two, because most killboxes are just that. Target practice...<br>
<br>
But, I hated killboxes with all my might until I found what was like to play in an eye server or my friend's killbox server with maps that made some sense. My friend's server is slower than eye, but his selection of maps goes way beyond the 1st-horrid-map-a-mapper-made type of killbox. And it's still very easy to dodge while in mid air, and very hard to hit ppl that dodge well. This changed my idea of it completely. Although I'm 90% a dm/ctf player, I still go there once in a while for a bit of more casual fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Making a server faster or giving people more air control doesn't make a game better it even makes it far less like quake 3. Have you guys ever played Q3? There is much less air control in Q3 then there is in the previous games. But that is part of what works in Q3 that the players trajectory in the air is more predictable so you get more mid air shots and can use more skill and less random luck. If you play in EYE servers or others with really fast air accel and low grav what you find is people just gravitate toward 1 hit kill weapons cause the guy can just grab health before he is killed plus people are doing alot less skilled shots and alot more just winging it hoping to get you. It isn't better it doesn't take more skill players just learn to use a different weapon way more then others. It is just a more specialized style of play where you use 1 skill more then any others and so the players have to specialize in that and tweak their settings accordingly. A guy who is amazing at map control and weapon timing is going to find his skill set nearly useless. <br>
<br>
The biggest pitfall is that many weapons get completely shoved off and you see far less diversity in play styles because the power, cylce rate, explosion radius and speed of travel for each weapon was better balanced for stock settings. When you go jack up all those settings lots of weapons just become useless. But that makes it easier for newbs to play which enhances its popularity since they need to become proficient in less skills to keep up with better players. <br>
<br>
Also all the settings get mitagated anyway. So yes you are faster in EYE settings but it means nothing when the areas of play are 4x bigger then kbh killboxes and 10x bigger then stock maps. In the end the angular velocity of you looking directions ends up being the same on average. Which makes all these severs feel about the same to me, if it really was faster I would have to raise my sensitivity to compete but I don't. So the only purpose it served was to make more weapons less useful. Now if I take stock settings and play an EYE map then I have to drop my sensitivity to aim well at those distances.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This thread has grown maybe too much and people forget why it was started or are too lazy to read all the posts. We're against sitting/hanging in mid-air ducks. As for high velocity in air, you try landing a hs in mid-air while travelling aka flying at 800+ velocity. It makes even grav nading look sweet cus there's so much control and unpredictability. I have to agree with Valar, please don't post if you barely played kbx in ANY settings at all! And stop trying to imagine what flying is like and start playing those servers I mentioned, they're like 8 or so in total..<br>
I hate when groups like this get started, like 'let's save dm'... 100 people join and there's like 2 percent that insist on the fact that it's dead already or there's no use.. very helpful! if you don't agree, don't join or stfu, but don't give bad influence to the other 98 percent or just talk without knowing, just to get attention.

Me neither. But considering a killbox size of (usualy) 2048x2048x2048 units, normal gravity makes it a very slow paced and seems to take forever to go from one side to the other (Also for this reason I prefer smaller killboxes). But the friction lower makes you float less, and air changed makes it faster and the gravity change will one be noticed during the 1st minute. Alternatively, 450 gravity with friction 3 almost seems like normal grav.<br>
All this makes it seem less baloon shooting, it makes it a very fast paced fight. <br>
<br>
Although, in conventional killboxes (kbh style) it can get boring anyway. That's why I prefer maps like killbox_bunker, killbox_tetris (great one) or Valar's trees map (can't remember the name). The two later ones arent' fully open, which makes the fights more interesting.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Me neither. But considering a killbox size of (usualy) 2048x2048x2048 units, normal gravity makes it a very slow paced and seems to take forever to go from one side to the other (Also for this reason I prefer smaller killboxes). But the friction lower makes you float less, and air changed makes it faster and the gravity change will one be noticed during the 1st minute. Alternatively, 450 gravity with friction 3 almost seems like normal grav.<br>
All this makes it seem less baloon shooting, it makes it a very fast paced fight. <br>
<br>
Although, in conventional killboxes (kbh style) it can get boring anyway. That's why I prefer maps like killbox_bunker, killbox_tetris (great one) or Valar's trees map (can't remember the name). The two later ones arent' fully open, which makes the fights more interesting.</div></blockquote>

You have a point. I love bunker, and tetris, never tried Valar's map. I'll try find it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

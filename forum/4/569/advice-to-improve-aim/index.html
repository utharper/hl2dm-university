	<div class="content">I guess i give in my input.<br>
As said before my post get your settings right make sure that your getting a smooth aim that you can move from a steady speed to really fast for those flick shots.<br>
Second with each weapon you aim differently obvious example is the x-bow. Best way is to predict a players movement in killbox at the other end of the room and getting you shot to connect ( this should help in getting you distances right and being able to read you opponent). This also goes for the mag even tho there is no delay in the shot being fired and landing its best not to try and aim for where the target is in stead aim where there going to be. <br>
Timing knowing when to press that trigger is also important which also links with reaction time. This mainly comes with practice which over time comes instinctive. Best way to get this right is staff jumping side to side trying to hit a target i usual get the cabinet in lockdown and balance a bucket on the top also to make it harder by standing really close to a corner wall and jumping pass it and hitting the target before landing on the floor. <br>
<br>
Last but not least your movement is very important I use more of my movement to aim than my actual mouse movement. My advice is to spend loads of time getting a good bhop where you should at the end up being able to change direction really quickly. thought practicing aim while bhoping and staff jumping you should be able to tell where you crosshair will be going. So it in time you get used to flying the crosshair over the target and hitting it. Best thing to do it use you sprays as targets i use my avatar image and try caping my girl in the head and other body parts while bhoping forward, sideways, backwards , at angles, at heights in mid air. Also jumping from behind objects.<br>
<br>
Ohh also play against people that can actually move and try not to do what i see most players do hold down sprint and staff side to side it uses allot of sprint and not that useful against bhoppers that don't move parrel to you. Also don't play low grav especially if your learning you movement I played a low grav did it before when i was being taught by my clan and it thro me off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, use waste a lot of sprint, but you would be amazed how many shots miss when you do this. That's because you get used to all the things you said, so you can hit easier a bunny hopper (cuz his movement is more predictable).<br>
I don't mean people should strafe with sprint always and bhop is bad. Is just that from time to time is a good technique to try, since people tend to miss.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah some of the hardest people to hit are the noobs who just run around and stop awkwardly. You just never know what they're going to do next.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">see? It's like that =P. You get used to aiming at people jumping around from a side to another, so you sometimes even hit like 3 consecutive shots against them.<br>
Then a new players just walks from side to side, and you don't even get one. =/<br>

	<div class="content">its just good practice if u want to improve your aim is to shot while bhoping and not fall into the trap of just using it to get around the map quickly because you are vulnerable if you can't aim good while bhoping. Plus u pull off shots quicker since your able to line up the shots faster. Second reason why not to use moving randomly on the side to side noobs use it and its a easy way to aim and your not really pushing your skills to improve your aim. yes it can be practicable the bhop if your not that good at it and don't mix up your movement and usually your dead in the first 2 seconds against a experienced bhoper that can aim so relative to him they standing still. Usually when i see someone doing this i don't play along with for a dual and just mess with then either by moving randomly around them wait for them to run out of ammo and aux and crowbar them while there reloading. or usually there dead before they get started and their aim is rubish when your moving up close around them hard for them to track u. Also a nad and a shotgun helps there going nowhere fast. If having trouble to shot them that means to work on your aim more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">WOW there was alot more suggestions then I thought.  I like all of them and will probably use them.   I noticed that people mentioned some about sensitivity and setting it correctly.  When I was getting my aim down.  I would put my sensitivity 3 or 4 up from what I was used too.  Then I would play a week then move it down 2 and then 2 more the next week.  It helps you keep your aim more steady.  Seems when you go down in sensitivity your aim gets more precise.  So play alot with higher sensitivity then bring it down to where you were comfortable and you will see you can stop easier and follow people easier.<br>
<br>
plus you can't set a specific mouse sensitivity for all people cause different mice move different then others.  Like my optical mouse sensitivity 8 or higher but when got a laser mouse sensitively 3 was about the same.<br>
<br>
Now another tip that a player I used to know did.  Was also a way to practice aiming but you wouldn't know it.  Basically the only difference between moving the mouse to click on the start button or click on x to close a windows and aiming in game is that the pointer moves in windows but the game the crosshairs don't but you still are moving the mouse the same amount to click on stuff.   So he would up his mouse sensitivity in windows all the way as high as he could while he did stuff on computer then in game he would lower it back to default before he played.  All I can say is I don't know if this would work but sounds like it would.  Also this guy was seriously awesome at aiming..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

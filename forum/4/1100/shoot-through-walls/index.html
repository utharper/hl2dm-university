	<div class="content">I've always been curious about his since hl2dm has such great physics.  Are there ANY walls that can be shot through like in cs 1.6?  I have never seen this used in a map or even ever heard it talked about, which leads me to believe that this is not something incorperated in hl2dm.  This really seems like a shame, I mean they have badass physics, unlike most any other game, yet you can't shoot through thin walls like back in cs 1.6.  Ganted this would only add to the "OMG WTF" factor of people getting killed, which is already inherantly high in this game because of the skill cap and plethera of advanced techniques.  Is this even possible to put into a map or is the engine just not capable for hl2dm?  I've always thought this was something missing from hl2dm, but that might just be because walling people is cs 1.6 was one of my favorite things.  Anyone know anything about this?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im pretty sure its not possible in DM cause when people say they were behind the wall when you shot them its because what they saw of their view SEEMED like they were behind the wall but in fact their model was still sticking out. I guess the only way to test that is have someone stand really close to a corner of a wall and try and shoot their head through the wall. I'm pretty positive that doesnt work though. In fact if it were even possible, it wouldnt even be remotely close to being useful.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, out of everything in the game this is what drives me bonkers the most.  It doesn't happen a lot .. but I can just tell what I am seeing is not even close to what the opponent sees.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
there is a way to make custom textures so you can shoot thru them with this command:<br>
<br>
"%compilepassbullets" 1<br>
<br>
most grate textures already have this.  I used them on the caverns map in that crossbow room as an example.. and the above camper rpg area.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
in cs its only weapons that do a certian degree of damage per shot, and even then it takes it down a notch after it passes through the wall. <br>
<br>
To keep with that trend half life only offers the mag and the xbow (grenades and rpgs already do this, without being dampend i believe).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">St00pid makes a good point, there aren't any weps like the m4 or AK ect which were the primary walling weps because of their damage bracket.  Theres not really an equivalent in hl2dm.  Meh oh well, doesn't really fit in hl2dm, probly for the better anyway lol, theres more than enough ways to die already lol. <br>
I really enjoyed walling from cs 1.6.  Yeah the map assault was notorious for walling, along with Nuke which had so great walling spots.  <br>

I can't stand css, valve completely ruined cs with css.  <br>

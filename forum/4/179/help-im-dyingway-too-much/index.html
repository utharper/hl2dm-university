I usually play for fun and I don't get too serious on how many times I die during the game. I'm older player(54)but I am a kid at heart and love to play on Spookface,etc. I know that age shouldn't matter to much, but whean it comes to <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">keyboarding I suck big time!</span>lol My two fingers that i use most of the time on my left hand (my right hand on my mouse,no side buttons,but have scroll wheel) don't have eyes on the tips of them so I somtimes have to look for the zoom button etc that I use for different movements,crouch,etc. and of course it causes me to move way to slow and throws my aim off. lol I usually get killed quick because I'm not fast enough-- <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"> Quite often the only time I can play is when I'm tired at the end of the day, and this old canuck has lost a bit of alertness to play most of the young guys. Sometimes I'm hot ! and do really well and sometimes come on top! This usually happens on some other maps with less experienced players.lol Ilike to go on them sometimes.lol It makes me feel a little better,HA! The gravity level for movement is set quite low on Misheps spook and i know that helps me on other maps where the grav. is set higher. My average ping is 135 and  quite often my actions are jumpy and delayed. This sure doesn't help. Anyway,I should have taken typing in school ! Any ideas on keyboard set up,mouse,weapons switching,etc for a guy who doesn,t type well? Sure would appreciate any help from all you pro's out there!</strong></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Have you read the lessons on the main site? They've helped me progress quite a bit over the last months and I think they're just what you're looking for  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow"> <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/curriculum.htm" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/curriculum.htm</a> <br>
<br>
If you decide to go for the keyboard layout that's suggested in the 'official  curriculum' then I think this keyboard map that I made would also help you out <a href="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y287/HoopR/Uploads/HL2Keylayout.jpg" class="postlink">*click here*</a>, I know it's probably quite a n00bish thing to do but when I first changed my keys I couldn't remember them so I made that and printed it out and sat it in front of me <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">also in my 50s and know of nothing better than video games for keeping the reflexes sharp. but if like me you've more or less sacrificed your hands to rl.. <br>
maybe try a gaming mouse like the mx518 and map your weapons to it. using the keyboard basically for movement only<br>

Glad someone is getting something out of the courses. They are still a work in progress, so check back on courses you have already read for updates. Hopefully we will add more video examples of the techniques soon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

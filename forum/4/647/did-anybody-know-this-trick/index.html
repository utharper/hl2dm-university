It is possible to take a radiator squared up and hit secondary fire just as it touches and jump.<br>

But, it is not reliable and does work better on some servers and with higher rates.<br>
Onti uses this technique for that awesome flying bowshot on Overwatch.<br>

How did scroll? seen it in Dingles video but never understood what it entailed <br>

Also I've been carrying an orb about and then all of a sudden it's pung me forward at 2k vel...whats the deal with that and can you control it?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i can reach 2000 vel but its damn hard to achieve and u need the just about the right settings it hard to tell if the server u are on will let you jump on object and fly with high vel. Its same with like have u tried on overwatch stand on the car and jump and grav hit the top roof and fly skyhigh like neo. well me and other players where messing around and two of us could do it but one could not we told him to change his net setting way up but he still could not do it so it might as well have something to do with your connection to the server as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well it wasnt that video anyway it was the FINALITY one with onti, poconut, soiz, nate etc... (sorry if i missed anyone). seemed a wee bit more achievable than master viktory's unless of course you have a special pair of Air Max or some whizz <br>

just a little correction ...soiz wasn't in it ! D: <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
And yeah... it's not that it seems more achievable ...I just that I sent the ones in which I achieved it ;D<br>
But the one that was freaking easy (trust me) on the server I played, was the trick that sent me uuuup high with the prop.<br>
I could do that like ... 8/10 ... It was soooo easy. But not anymore...seems some settings have been modified...<br>
Don't ask whichs cuz I have no idea... I just know that this trick is incredibly easy on some servers, and the other way round on others. :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

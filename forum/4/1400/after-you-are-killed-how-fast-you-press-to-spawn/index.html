	<div class="content">Topic title is pretty self explanatory.<br>
<br>
I'm kindof ADD and impatient so i have a hard time not pressing the button to spawn right away, only to end up right next to the player who just killed me with just teh weapons i spawned with....leading to a quick death.<br>
<br>
So correct me if I'm wrong, but the faster you press the mouse/jump/whatever key  you will spawn closer to the spot where you died.<br>
I have recently been watching where my oponenet has been headed and trying to wait a few seconds to hopefully spawn further away.<br>
<br>
Any input is welcome.<br>

In 1v1/2v2s if you die near a spawn point it's smart to wait it out as most times players with wait by a nearby spawn point for an easy kill, but the will not wait the entire force respawn time, so if you wait sometimes you can turn the tides and get a spawn then kill</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have to confess something here.  Some of you know about my clan culture (no headshots, no bhopping, no rpg's, etc).  I have trouble with spawn kills.  When someone spawns near me, I don't attack.  And I usually wind up dead when I'm not on one of our clan servers.  Spawn killing is a huge issue on our clan servers.  The ultimate faux pas.  It's a hard thing to turn on/off in my mind.  <br>
<br>
But... our clan culture slowly changing.  Headshots have been turned back on and bhopping is allowed... though not necessarily encouraged.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOOOL I looooove that map, but I HAAAATE those spawn points. And the fact that it has an rpg (or at least where it's located).<br>
Worse than spawning in the basement with everyone noticing it imidiately, is spawning in the basement with everyone noticing it imidiately and you noticing you're stuck in a ton of props and can't just get rid of them all before they all change their mind for some mystical reason and all decide to shoot at you instead of each other like they were doing. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"><br>

Only in ctf, when I'm rushing with the flag and die, I stay watching where the enemy takes it, just in case they hide it nearby, and tell my team it's nearly-exact location.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Learn to use your sound to locate your opponent.<br>
<br>
Lockdown specifically:  <br>
Know exactly how many items can be picked up understairs, up top coming from shower, undercharger and recognize the sound of the ladder, not too many use the ladder going down, usually only up, and the sound of chargers.<br>
<br>
Eventually when you're dead on and your opponent can't touch anything without giving away his location, you'll pickup his footsteps as rebel model, and use of the sprint.<br>
<br>
This is important in getting the first nade off or first mag shot and getting the drop on your enemy before they do.  And if you're looking for some WOW shots, knowing exactly where your enemy is can get you one of those perfectly timed xbow prediction shots or bounces.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

Yeah I listen to the sounds and all a good bit....for me though, I use it to stay away and evade people on the map seeing as how I have little chance when someone good is there lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sound is a real weak spot for me. Whenever I put surround on I tend to crash more often. I have some pro-grade headphones also, but can't wear them because I typically have to listen also to the baby monitor. Make the most of your time prior to having kids! I know it costs me score wise, especially against the better players, but there is not much I can do about it right now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i may try your movement binds.  i use esdf and my "f" key is in a semi-permanent mashed position (not stuck so that i constantly move right, but there is no "spring-back" to the key which makes it reallllllly sensitive to touch).  if i make my "f" key backwards movement, it'll get less use at least.  i suppose i'll have to get a new keyboard though... sooner or later.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think the key to it is also having jump bound to space as well.   <br>
<br>
I use space for the first jump in the bhop or for strafe then use wheel for the rest of the hops.  I also use space to jump in a fire fight if I need to which leaves all the fingers on my mouse hand for controlling that and firing only.  It did take me time to get it down and train everyone to do it at the right time/sequence, but for me using space only was nothing but fail, that side was trying to do too much at once.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">I use scroll wheel to jump, and only the scroll wheel. I don't have space bound to jump, its bound to my crossbow. Also, I use my index finger to scroll jump and to shoot. Holding the mouse so that my middle finger would scroll and my index would rest on MOUSE1 would really mess up my movement... I can jump and shoot nearly at the same time, and don't have a problems between jumping and shooting in firefights, so I guess its just a matter of getting used to it. I think its worth it since it frees up the space bar, which a really great key to bind to your favorite weapon, since you can press it without having to let go of movement keys or anything, so you can switch to it at any time.<br>
<br>
As for the aliases, they sort of work like variables in programming, for those of you who know enough about that. For example, his first alias is:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>alias rebel "cl_playermodel models/humans/Group03/Male_03.mdl"</code></pre></div>

If you look further up the config, you will notice this bind linking to that alias:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>bind "," "rebel"</code></pre></div>

In effect, what this does is let him switch to that rebel model, and more importantly switch to rebels from combine in one key stroke, which is better than the alternative of ESC&gt;OPTIONS&gt;change model&gt;CLICK OK.<br>
<br>
The other aliases basically link together weapon switches and sensitivity. Most regular configs bind weapons like this:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>bind "s" "use weapon_shotgun"</code></pre></div>
Instead, what he did was:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>bind "s" "pbshotty"</code></pre></div>

And later aliases the word pbshotty to <br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>alias pbshotty "use weapon_shotgun;sensitivity 0.8"</code></pre></div>

Which just changes the weapon to shotgun, and changes the mouse sensitivity to 0.8.<br>
<br>
In reality, all weapons except AR2, RPG and Gravity Gun get a sensitivity of 0.8, and the ones mentioned get 1.2<br>
<br>
I hope that explains it well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I tried literally for months but the A-D key presses screwed with getting the space bar exactly right to maintain the hop.  I switched to mouswheel for that part and I was finally able to improve because it gave otherwise idle fingrs something to do besides allowing the other hand to get their part of it right.<br>

Seriously, in the end what does it matter what key/combinations someone uses as long as it works for them?   Doesn't matter one damn bit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Pistol and ar also benefit from scrolling- faster firing and smoother aim for pistol, and permanent minimum cone for ar.<br>

Pistol and ar also benefit from scrolling- faster firing and smoother aim for pistol, and permanent minimum cone for ar.<br>
<br>
And that said, i dont think the lack of a delay timer on these things (jump/shoot) was a good idea, as it gives the ability to effectively macro what would otherwise be skill intensive timing etc, but its way too late in the games life to change anything now.</div></blockquote>

There is a delay timer in shooting pistol and jumping, the game engine does not respond if you press  or +jump too fast and if yopu press + attck too fast it just fires at th minimum rate like holding the button down. those with a Logitech G9 mouse will know what I mean as the wheel can free wheel for along tiem and very very fast.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
"shut up pern, i used to only use spacebar to bhop for ages i used to be able to maintain 500 pretty easily"<br>
<br>
As was discussed in another thread, u were never seen going at those speeds in dm games, just because u can did it once or twice on a lan server by yourself doesnt mean that ur consistantly going that fast all the time, even though all of this is irrelevant ill keep going cause u ppl seem to want it.<br>
<br>
" but because your trying to fine time it so much you would often only get 6 hops out of it then stop."<br>
<br>
Generally u dont need to, especially if u prefer free for all.<br>
<br>
"Pern the game has changed a lot i think your still stuck a few years back,"<br>
<br>
The day of the worrior is over! And there are less players, though a few still remain who for some odd reason want to become the leetest cunts around, why i dont know personally, the game was never competition worthy, and that statement coming from me 3-4 years ago in numurous conversations with different ppl.<br>
<br>
" you would not stand a chance against me with my scrolling skills moving at 540+ all the time"<br>
<br>
I speced u recently a few times and still havent seen any evidence of that, good on u if u can but still irrelevant.<br>
This was all about PB being a turd, not who is the leetest cunt on the forums, funny how i was accused of trying to do a one upper, then every other cunt, including the accuser, does exactly that.<br>
<br>
"Then pern after you finish finally being an ultimate non scroller you also need to learn the other elements to this game that make you good, but since all you care about is perfecting your non scrolling bhops you suck at it."<br>
<br>
I am aware of it all, but i only take from this game the aspects that i like, as for me sucking, i do allright even with the lag, and frankly wouldnt care if i did suck, though i cannot play on those high tick servers, and i dont spam (way of the worrior) and never will, never have had any intention of playing this game competitivly.<br>
<br>
Infact, if ur so goal orientated, why dont u go play a game where the level of competition is higher.<br>
<br>
As for ghost dog being worth more, he might be worth more if ur asking about effective comp strats? Even though it takes more to execute then it does to advise, but in wat universe does his accumulative knowledge of the game = more then mine. Every one, on my steam freinds list, including deathwish, weather i was playing or not at the time or not(mostly not) has asked for my assistence on more then one occasion, in regards to all sorts of things, console stuff...actual game play stuff, everything, everyone on that shit. Maybe ill get a possy up in here though im not sure that i am that desperate for other ppl to fight my battles for me.<br>

They chose the game because they thought it looked fun. Rough quote from one of the main fios people prior to the tourney: "...we chose hl2dm because we really liked the magnet gun". The eventual winner made it clear in one of his post-win interviews that he didnt think hl2dm was a particularly competitive game either, though the load of trash stock maps they used, all of which were in fully unclipped / unfixed forms and none of which played all that well 1v1, surely had much to do with that.<br>

Not to say the game isnt competitive, but compared to top end, well refined games such as cpma, 1.6, ssf2t, sc and the like, its got a loooong way to go (and at this point its pretty obvious its never going to get there, short of a serious competitive mod being coded to completion).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well i actually did think valve would return to supporting it at one point, though time certainly proved me wrong on that one. And at this point, having seen some of their changes to cs/tf2, and how poorly some of their previous changes to hl2dm worked out, id honestly rather they just left it as is- and besides, nothing they could do for the game couldnt be done better by (a) dedicated player(s) in a mod.<br>
<br>
And of course its competitive, probably moreso than 99% of the games out there atm. It just doesnt compare well to those games at the top.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I suppose, but i said it wasnt competition worthy not that it wasnt competitive *winks*<br>
<br>
I beleive, aside from the bugs, hl2dm has major balance issues plus could use some gewderer maps. But that, once again, is personal preference.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Its not the fault of the game, its the pigheaded attitude of "Noes, we can't have new maps because we will have to learn how to play them or OMGZ we might lose on a new map in a league (THE HORROR!!!!) where we don't even win anything anyway."<br>
<br>
New maps would keep it fresh and interesting but some people just get pissed if their fav map isn't there and they whine and say "Im gona quiti and not play if my fav map isn't there" and so the same maps are voted in every time.  Meanwhile, everyone else gets bored and quiti anyway.  Its a no win situation.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You act as if this community is any different then any other competitive online community out there. The trash talk, divisions and ect are the same but on a larger scale in any larger game in the past I've been associated with. In fact the trash talking and devious actions were worse, people got hacked or banned from leagues just because an admin didnt like them. you can always do two games at once, even if I became a cevo p player in CSS id still probably scrim with my old hl2dm friends weekly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">pros and cons to either?  I've used Vent before and it's pretty good but you still have to press a button to talk so I don't see how it's that different from the in-game<br>
<br>
preferably I'd like something that's voice-activated and I heard Teamspeak is, or alternately is there any way to make Vent voice-activated?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I personally have found Vent to be a major pain in the ass to use and get it to work right.  I have a digital USB mic.  Vent wont pick it up and I have to use a seperate analog mic (jack) to get people to hear me in Vent.  Members of our clan use Teamspeak every day and I have found it very easy to set up and to get others set up in it and to get them set up and tweeked on the rare occasions that they need to have something adjusted.  Alot of times any adjustments are OS related not TS related.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

On TS when multiple people are talking at the same time it's just a mess, vent seems to handle that better. If you are using Ts theres a neat little program called team speak overlay or TSO, I really liked using that when using TS as it put a green name in the corner of your screen showing the name of the person talking, which is good for when theres a ton of people on it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Being a European player in teams with multiple nationalities, I've always found it difficult to hear what ppl say in TS, especially if they have a German accent or so. Though I'm Swedish, my English comprehension is pretty good since I recently lived in the US for 3 years. Still, I find it much easier to pick up what ppl say on Vent. Maybe you can pick a better codec in TS, but if so it's almost no one who bothers or knows how to do it.<br>
Maybe sensitivity is more of a pain to set right on Vent, I really don't know, but the problem of getting everyone you listen to to be at a reasonably equal level is just as much a PIA on TS as Vent if you ask me.<br>
Also, dunno if this is true, but I hear ppl claiming TS to have less of a delay compared to Vent.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Same, I find vent makes my game a little jumpy.<br>

I prefer TS, it seems easier to use and set up binds for various controls.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">In both you can change the codec used for communication if you are having trouble with quality increase it. If you need it to be faster and less laggy decrease it. TS has a better UI,  Once you get to know either of them you will be fine. I guess overall I tend to prefer TS for it's better UI and it has a couple of message features that can be handy.<br>
Honestly all of them suck compared to team sound. I don't know if they still develop team sound but years ago it was vastly superior to either of these. Kinda messed up how we go backwards.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

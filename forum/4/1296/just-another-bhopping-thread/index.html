	<div class="content">It looks like there's alot of people going out and trying to teach the hl2:dm community to bhop through tutorials, videos, in-game training, and such. I'm wondering though, how many people out there (who are confident in their ability to hop around) learned it through training or some form of instruction, as opposed to the people like me who just gradually picked it up on their own. In other words, is all this training that some of you guys are going through even worth it?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Instruction could not hurt. Some, like you or me, may have to figure it out for themselves.<br>
<br>
I learned the strafe jump from the Netrex video, then bouncing with no direction keys.<br>
Then i added in left/right strafe with mouse-from fidos revenge or W/e,  and now the aiming is getting better.<br>
<br>
Seeing someone leap over the railing in LD got me started on the jump.<br>
Seeing Mario64 Master curve through the air got me strafe/hopping.<br>
<br>
It was long and hard and only a few instances alone in OW, where i slide along quickly, out of the blue, fired me up. Im still not great but get around.<br>
It was like EUREKA.<br>
So, help is helpful, but there is no substitute for practice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

But same as impala, I was one night alone trying to understand the tutorial, and suddenly EUREKA, I got the movement ^^.<br>
Then it took me some more time to polish it...but I guess it's nice so far ^^.<br>
What choice would that be? 1st or 2nd? XD</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I learned HL1 bunny hopping way back in the Counter-Strike 1.0 - 1.5 days. My brother taught me, but I was shit at it.<br>
<br>
The day I played HL2DM, I took advantage of the sprint and jump functions. I couldn't bunny hop, but I was able to go faster than average by sprinting, then jumping in a linear line. Near the time of joining BMC, I was able to bunny hop, albeit slowly.<br>
<br>
Quite a bit later, Yard_Guy tried to fix up my bunny hopping to help me get faster since I have some bad habits when starting. I'm probably a bit faster now than before, but I haven't changed too significantly since 2005 I think.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I did not know anything about bhop until chocolatepeanut taught me it. I did not find any of the video tutorials any use i found it better for someone to look at what im doing and tell me what i was doing wrong. Im pretty good at bhop now better than most but still can improve. Its really down to determination for me once i was shown it i had to do it.   <br>
personal trainning is what i think is best as well they might be shown special ways of learning and doing movement that not many know about. Right now im train new guys that have join my clan usually can get them to start bhoping within a week but is all down to the time they put into it really and how good they are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That was half a year ago, and some games I move quite well now, some games I just hop once or twice and sit like a duck  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"><br>

oh, btw. The first time I knew I was doing something right, was when I could hop in a straight line, no direction, and keep velocity over 320 for a number of hops.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My movement started to get better after i just jumped all the time the simple sprint jump. Then i explored that iam a bit faster when i press a strafe key before i press jump (no mouse curve just a simple strafe jump). After jumping around like that for a while fyckfacko told me to press duck after jumping and then press jump everytime i hit the ground (nothing more). And then i practiced and preacticed and trained and practiced. And found out all the odds and ends that make a bunnyhop perfect on my own.<br>
If you learn it on your own it will take much longer to get perfect but once your there it really is. <br>
So, help is helpful, but there is no substitute for practice. second that. Ppl who i teach and dont practice what i tell em just fall back to their old movement.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I would say that some form of instruction is really good for helping people to undertsand it initially, even if its just a tutorial video.  And as others have said, if you don't practice on your own you won't ever get it down pat.  I learned to starfe jump back in CS 1.6 on kz or kreedz maps.  The objective in kreedz mapsis to accend to the top of the map by completing tons of technical strafe jumps.  When I started hl2dm I brought this knowledge with me from CS 1.6, and soon after starting to play was referred to Seagulls bhop tutorial, which helped me figure out timing and how to integrate the sprint into the strafe jump.  I never got any 1on1 instruction, just an instructional video, which with a little perserverence should be enough for anyone dedicated to learning the bhop to at least grasp the key strokes+mouse sweep.   When I'm playing in a pub or a scrim i'm always practicing cause I always bhop, but an hour a day JUST focusing on bhop in an empty server has really sped things along.  I just put on some music and my hour is over before I know it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hearing about some big money tournament called FIOS, Joining and playing some 60 matches or so against some of the best names in the game and not even having a clue. LOL!<br>
<br>
Seriously tho, I owe many thanks to Tw1tch, Bobadin and Nate for spending a lot of time teaching some n00b how to move. I did watch seagull's vid and netrex's vid and I knew in my mind what I needed to be doing, but making my fingers do it was another story. I think it was the 1 on 1 help I got from those guys that made me finally learn it, and the satisfaction of finally being able to do it is second to nothing I've ever accomplished in any other game.<br>
<br>
I also owe thanks to Walking Target and Ko-Tao for helping me refine it and make it even better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I had gotten into the CAL CTF tournament and after season 1 was over I heard about this bhop tutorial by Seagull. Out of curiosity I downloaded and found it really interesting. I then practiced for quite a while on our server with my roommate until we had a rough idea of what we were doing. It stayed a rusty jump for a long time until alt168 (sorry if I mis-spelled your name) helped us refine the jump (and taught us to use the scroll wheel instead of the stupid space bar...). Since then I can speed around maps at leisure while shooting off 20 mag rounds hoping one of the bullets actually hits  :roll:.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">For a while I've been thinking about this, and finally I'm writing up a team play guide. I'm currently at a stage where I would very much like to hear of tips and advice from the HL2DMU community.<br>
<br>
Do you have any thoughts about this subject that you think not many players are aware of, don't care about enough to take into consideration or simply is over most peoples heads, then do by all means write something here (or pm me if you don't want to share openly). Since I believe the text is not yet complete enough, I would like to keep it to a select audience for the time being. If you believe you have special competence in the matter, pm me explaining how you might contribute and I'll consider sharing at this stage.<br>
<br>
A note: the guide is only about matters that directly concern team play, not so much things that might as well be covered by an ffa guide. In its current form it is also more aimed at playing with ff on, though it should involve only minor changes to generalize for this too.<br>
<br>
If you think it's good enough I will by all means try to share it somewhere, with HL2DMU being my preferred place. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Being a part of the curriculum here, however, didn't occur to me when I started my little project. It sort of just came to me because I had been contemplating these things for some time. I could show you what my guide currently looks like and you can tell me how that would fit your ideas. I'm sure working on it together has all the potential of improvement.<br>

Of course, if any of the admins thinks it would fit better in the athletic center I'm all for moving it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">been over 3 years since i started playing this damn game and so i thought well bout time i start learning bhop.<br>
so...a friend showed me a few moves to get started. totally threw me from where i was. and i became the suckiest player ever.<br>
i was all "ok , that's cool. i knew i'd suck at first"<br>
but then...my GPU died following my G9 mouse a couple of months back. so i was playing with a f@%ing MS mouse for 2 months, got used to it.<br>
now got a new GPU and a new G9 and it's getting used to movement all over again. now i suck even more than i did before. i feel like i'm not moving and 8 yr old kids rape me without braking a sweat.<br>
<br>
therefore i rant.<br>
is all i had to say  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">It gets tricker when ramps/bumpy displacements come into play. It's good to understand Source player physics a bit. Basically, pressing forward or backward puts in a "maximum" speed. For this reason, many players advise completely letting go of the forward key once you make your initial jump. Holding forward makes you slower by limiting your speed gain AND hinders your aerial strafing movement. For some reason, when in midair, you have much better control of your character using only the mouse and left/right strafe keys rather than forward/backward keys unless, as aforementioned, you want to limit/stop your momentum. For this reason, you will see many players wobbling side to side in mid-air in certain trick maps and "circling" into speed ramps and whatnot.<br>
<br>
tl;dr = Get used to letting forward anytime you're in mid-air. Use strafe key + turn mouse smoothly to that direction to gain aerial space/speed instead of forward key. Get accustomed to mwheel jumping in order to be able to adapt to uneven surfaces (such as dm_avalon). Mwheel jumping makes certain techniques such as trimping (or jumping extra-high off of ramps) possible, not easier. Use backward key to fine-tune jumps for trick maps that require you to undershoot rather than overshoot jumps (this is very... very... rare).<br>
<br>
Oh wait, that wasn't tl;dr. Oh well. Basically, if you let go of forward key, your momentum will not be stopped until you bump into a wall or make a sharp turn. So, if you were to be blasted into space at a billion velocity, you would continue to go faster and faster so long as you use only left/right keys. However, as soon as you TAP a foward/backward key, your maximum speed would be a tad bit slower (or possible even capped, if you hold onto it) than if you had never pressed those buttons.<br>

i've been doing it this way for over a year now.<br>
<br>
in fact, i've been starting my movement with a strafe for a very long time now and it just something i started doing naturally. What i'm not doing naturally is:<br>
<br>
- delaying the jump til only after the strafe (i'm so used to jump and strafe together)<br>
- letting go of the fwd (my whole brain is like WHAATT??? everytime i do it.<br>
- and the keeping of momentum using the right left keys.<br>
<br>
the whole concept of not using the sprint and fwd constantly is the hardest thing. once i let those two go i'll be in a much better shape.<br>

	<div class="content">Using space bar and then switching to mouse wheel is probably gonna be a headache like one of those Brain Age games. You're basically using your left brain as you press space bar with your right thumb, then switching to your right brain by scrolling with your left finger. I'd say go to mouse wheel as soon as possible. It's not the timing part that makes you go above 500. It's learning the fundamentals correctly the <strong class="text-strong">first</strong> time. You do NOT want to make bad habits and then have to fix them 2 years later. That's why, despite being one of the first players to even know about bhopping, I am currently one of the slower players here. I have bad curving and a small initial jump and don't really want to bother fixing those habits since they're ingrained into my head now.<br>
<br>
So yeah, I heavily recommend having someone who's really fast and a good teacher spectate you. Make sure he can actually teach you too. There are some great players in this games, but they can't really explain things or give advice for crap (or they just forget to teach fundamentals and skip right ahead to the more advanced things).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I just posted a tutorial I made some time ago. Take a look to see if there's some detail you might not know.<br>

<br>
I've been using wasd ever since games came with that default. I didn't like it much at first but I got used to it. The main advantage was all teh useful surrounding keys. But the main reason I switched to wasd, and even now I can't switch back, was cuz of keyboard position. At that time I used to get the keyboard on my lap, which, if I used the arrows wouldn't be much confy having it falling leftwards. Now I just have my printer filling the space I'd need to do that. I could move my printer, but I prefer wasd anyway.<br>
<br>
Even though, I don't believe there may be a big diference in performance.<br>
<br>
As for the mouse, if I got it right, it's a perfectly ordinary problem when you go from a sh.. mouse to a high dpi one. I was used to my old-and-not-bad-at-all-no-brand-mouse and when I switched to my razer I had the hardest time getting my movement and aim back again. I had to go through this twice, cuz I had a problem with the razer once. Actually was 3 times (old mouse -&gt; Razer / Razer -&gt; old mouse / old mouse -&gt; razer again).<br>
<br>
I use mwheeldown for jumps (even though I have up binded too). Seems more natural to me than up. But I still can do it with space, just not flawlessly. <br>

- and the keeping of momentum using the right left keys.
</div></blockquote>This is not only for the momentum, it's also for making turns and adjustments to your route. The way I practiced it at the beggining was to start stoped, duck and start jumping over and over. Then start pressing one strafe key, then the other alternately on each jump, then starting to move the mouse accordingly. You'll start gaining speed if you're doing it right and probly get the habit of not pressing the forward key. Then you just need to practice letting go of it upon strafe-jumping.<br>
<br>
If you need any help with it just gimmi a ring. Add Skaruts in steam if you need. (Or Lich, dunno if it's the current name that matters. Or look into J. Foxs or Boshed friends or something like that) I like helping ppl on these matters.<br>

	<div class="content">Bunnyhop is so incredibly F'ed up. Its completely counter-intuitive.  Moving forward with out forward!?!?  Using the mouse to slide back and forth~?~?<br>
<br>
Timing the jump exactly... W/e  its very strange.<br>
Although i am not very good at it, i do have a way to teach it.<br>
<br>
I get the strafe going by feeling the centrifugal FLICK or spin into a jump.<br>
<br>
Then, timing a crouched jump with NO direction keys, just the bounce (to UNLEARN using forward!, It works)<br>
<br>
And then adding a and d and mouse curve (the speedskate portion).<br>
<br>
Practice on jump maps.<br>
<br>
It works. I have seen folks actually BH in one night!~  something that took months for me.<br>
Anyways, it never occurred to me Val wasn't BHing!??!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

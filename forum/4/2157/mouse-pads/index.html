	<div class="content">So I always used trackball mice before like 3 years ago when I got my first laser mouse, a g5.  I've never gotten a mouse pad for it, though, just used my desktop.  I've been wondering if a mouse pad really makes a difference.  My desk is just finished wood, nothing special.  I've been considering the func 1030 mouse pad...not gonna get a razer pad cause i just dont like razer in general.  So what are your guys' opinions on mouse pads?  Do they work really well or just a little or what?  Please don't bother endorsing getting one if you've always used one and never played without one on like a wood veneer desktop. Thanks</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Like yourself I never used a mouse pad thinking they are a waste and do not do anything but when i got a mx518  a friend recomended a Func 1030.  Upon installing (lol) I noticed a huge difference in the smoothness the mouse moved accross the mat compared to the table surfac also it will protect your desk from wearing out.<br>
I initially used the smooth side of the func but have since worn it even smnoother, I can see light reflect off it more in the middle than the edges. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> well it is 3 years old.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have been using a G5 since it came out (V1 with one side button, now using a V2 once it came out) Like you I just used my desktop at first until about 3 months ago. My desktop wore out in the mouse area quite sometime ago, it was like the top layer of veneer wore off and a white surface below was showing through. When that happened I noticed inconsistency in the way the mouse was responding to my input so I decided to get a mat.<br>
<br>
 I tried a few of the various ones on the market but did not like them for various reasons. I am a fairly low sensitivity user so first thing I noticed was most mats just were not big enough, and I would be going off the mat or constantly having to adjust it. Second thing I noticed was that most of the slick surface types were just way too much for me, it felt like I was now a high sensitivity user even with a in game sensitivity of 1.5. The slick surfaces types just made my movements to fast, and the control sides didn't seem much better. The third thing I found irritating was that most of them made my wrist or arm uncomfortable as I was used to it being level with the desktop and now it was raised 1/4 inch or more depending on the mat.<br>
<br>
After trying 3 or 4 different pads or mats I settled on a 10.00 supermat (<a href="http://www.handstands.com/retail/mouse-mat/super-mousemat.php" class="postlink">http://www.handstands.com/retail/mouse- ... usemat.php</a>). It's made of the same type of material that a standard mouse pad is and is extremely large and is only about 3/16 inch thick. I find my aim and control is as good as it ever was if not better using this pad. After getting used to it and liking it I got to thinking about something else, since I use my desktop and not a tray for my keyboard and mouse my elbows rest on the desktop while playing and after extended periods they tend to start hurting on the inside from contact with the wood. I went and bought two more of these pads and placed one on each side where my elbows rest and that made a very comfortable surface for my arms to rest on and it also elevated the right arm to feel like I'm at the same level as the mouse, just like before on the desktop.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This ^<br>
<br>
Im still using a piece of blue canvas ($2.99) that i picked up 3 years ago at an office supply store, and the only complaints i have are that its too small, and needs replacing due to age. I tried a couple of gaming mousepads ($25-40 each iirc) and found they were even worse than the cardboard box that i use as a desk (generally too slick, meaning the xhair would jitter onscreen), which doesnt say much for the pads overall.<br>
<br>
When i replace the box with a table in a week or so, ill also be upgrading my pad to a piece of canvas thats 4x larger ($19.95) but otherwise pretty much identical to the pad i have now.<br>
<br>
I tested a couple of gaming keyboards instore as well ($75+ each), and not only were they just as unable to handle more than 3-4 specific simultaneous keystrokes as the generic logitech kb ($5.95) that came with my pc, their response wasnt any better either. Also, i use my gfs noise-isolating earbuds ($16.95 iirc) as headphones, and while they could be better, they give better sound than my old zalman 5.1 surround full cup headset ($69.95) or any of the other gaming headsets ive tried in stores.<br>
<br>
Otoh, my mx518 mouse ($39.95) is leagues better than the generic optical model ($9.95) that came with the pc, so gaming-specific gear can pay off sometimes at least, though most of it seems to just be generic junk with a load of tacky gimmicks and an extra zero added to the price.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">truth.  I'm using a generic Belkin mousemat with wristrest and I don't see how it's any worse or better than a "gaming" mousemat.<br>
<br>
the main difference between the Fatal1ty keyboard I've been using for the last few months and the stock Dell keyboard I was using before that is, lower profile keys, which are a little more comfortable to use for long periods of time.  and, MAYBE marginally more responsive since they take a few nanoseconds less time to press --- not really enough to make a big difference though.<br>
<br>
the mouse on the other hand... I went from a 800DPI stock Dell mouse to a Razer Deathadder (1800DPI) and wow, what a difference.  I mean, a gaming mouse doesn't automatically make a person awesome overnight, but it helps a lot to have one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree with what L2K writes - also playing with both elbows resting at the desk. I'm currently using a Razer Mantis control and am happy (I didn't like the Copperhead mouse I tried though). For a long time I used a func1030, thinking it was really good. If I go back to that now, however, it seems like the friction is too low in that I glide around too easily, resulting in less control. I think I prefer the cloth type just because it's a good balance between stability (which needs some friction) and precision (ultimately no friction). Not to mention it's comfortable and doesn't cool you down during those long winter playing sessions <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> I'm probably not too dependent on a big mousing surface, but I don't really see any drawback with it either.<br>
<br>
Every time I end up without a pad I get frustrated because of too much friction or inconsistencies due to reflections.<br>

At only £12 you can't go wrong with the Goliathus and can't get much bigger than 444mm x 355mm x 4.3mm<br>

	<div class="content">LOL at Libby's post. I still rock my choo-choo mousepad, not saying its better, it's just preference, or actually, laziness and the unwillingness to go spend $10 on a pretty one with stars and planets on it I saw at Officemax the other day. I did almost break down and buy the one with kitties and puppies too.....but on a serious note, I do prefer foam for some reason, could just never get used to that "slick'' feel of some of the higher end pads.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It was about 1/4 of an inch thick and I was always hitting my knuckles on the desk above the keyboard shelf.  The steel series is about 1/3 the thickness and the surface seems to run the mouse much better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lol well I just used a dish rag like usual to wipe it off beforehand but I got frustrated because a few spots weren't coming off so I scrubbed really, really hard to get them off and I guess I actually took the coating off :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

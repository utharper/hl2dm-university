	<div class="content">First off, this is my first post here. And i really enjoy reading the post and information posted here as well as the videos. So a big thanks to the site, the instructors and the people giving out helpful tips.<br>
<br>
Now, here is problem. I've played the game and can play pretty good shooting and killing folks. Now i would like to just learn the stuff far as bhoping, speed crawling, yo-yo'n, i guess more less the advanced stuff. As now i really rather help people that hasn't played do the simple stuff when they join our server, such as cooking grenades, prop jumping, bouncing bolt shots. Just little stuff that helps somone new to the game. I'm past the point of just playing for a score as i need to learn the advanced stuff now.<br>
<br>
Now giving that long drawn out post. Here is the second problem, as this will probably get a laugh or two. I play on the right side of the keyboard, arrows to move, shift to dunk, r-ctrl to jump, kp_ins for use. Well you get the point. Now since i want to learn to bhop, etc. I'm now looking at my layout of keys and their positions and wondering if i need to go back to the left side. Down side would be like learning to walk again. So basically i need to figure out if i need to stay on the right side or just dump all the years of playing on the right side and move to the default side and learn that.<br>
<br>
Yes, i know it is a bit weird, but i guess the extra buttons on the mouse kinda helped me out witht he right side combo. So tips , opinions, suggestions, laughing, or whatever is welcome. Just really rather have fun learning stuff now then just killing folks. Sorry for the lon drawn out rant of this topic and trying to explain this issue.<br>

	<div class="content">I had this very issue and sadly still can't bhop after switching sides but its only cuz I'm jump retarded in general but switching sides did help tremendously overall, I would recommend it but I will tell you it's a royal pain in the ass. I never had the desire of switching back either, one I made the switch I was very happy with the results.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>

I think its great you want to teach others, more people would benefit from this, at one point i was trying to get this very training to my clan and friends once a month and they seem to enjoy any extra help they could get. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
<br>
A lot of people do not want to learn any more than they know tho, they are quite happy where they are and sometimes feel resentful if you want to teach them stuff like nade cooking that takes a lot of practice to perfect and anything that requires practice, so don't push but make it available to them.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

Good luck! Some great teachers here, none that had any patience with me but hey, im a pain in the ass maybe you will do better  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>

Yea i use a deathadder and have the gravity gun already binded to mouse 5 already. And it makes a huge impact in the game. And my reload is middle mouse button, it works pretty good that way.<br>
<br>
So i guess i shall move to the left side then and see what happens. Figured it would be easy to learn to bhop as the keys are more better layed out on that side. Yes, i would rather help people learn then worry about a score any day. The thanks of helping someone learn is way better then a first place score anyday in my book.<br>
<br>
Just i guess i have moved on and killing folks for a score tends to bore me these days. And i would much rather learn some good skills these days to return to people that can't do it int he game. As i have always seen people do stuff that was neat and skilled and that makes me want to do this as well.<br>
<br>
Guess now i get shot to death missing keys for a few days. But it shall be a good learning curb for me to be on the recieving end for a while now.<br>

I'm just having a real hard time bhoping that way. Seems i either need to rearrange some keys or move to the other side where the close are easier to get to. That is the main thing i'm trying to get the hang of right this minute. More or less could be i'm just starting out and it is just really hard to get a pattern down, idk but something isn't working.<br>
<br>
Either way i do it i'm still going to have to relearn all the keys again. so that is where i'm stuck at........<br>

Before you start bhopping, learn to strafe jump as that is your initial jump and without perfecting it you won't have any speed to carry.<br>
<br>
Also make a demo of you practising your bhop and stick it in the <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=22" class="postlink">Demo Analysis</a> section of the forum, this way we'll be able to see what you're doing wrong and help you from there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

WASD for movemet<br>
E shotgun<br>

shift for sprint <br>
space for duck <br>
1 for pistol<br>
c for smg<br>
<br>
for mouse wheel click down is grenade <br>
wheel foward for jump<br>
wheel backwards is timeleft<br>
sidebutton are mag and other crossbow<br>
wheel tilt left rpg <br>
wheel right pulse<br>
<br>
My advice is get your sens for your mouse right and mouse fix installed. Then learn to walk before you can run metalty going about it start with basics do the lockdown jump then prtain to get the staft jump right then create a server turn off the grav and just use your mouse and AD to moveabout the map aim map is best for this with it roof area. Then do mag surf then just keep trying to perform it under pressure in a game. <br>
<br>
converts from the arrow key have big troubles with changing since they are used to one hand only doing few things. But this setup is about having as many keys avaible to one had close togther so you will have to be multitasking with both hands. I only moved the weapon to the mouse so i can change on the go.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

IIRC, .conflict used to play like that, he was pretty good but improve a lot when he rearranged his whole config and moved to the left side of the keyboard.<br>
He might be able to tell the story better ;P<br>

<br>
Okay i did a short demo of me trying this. The first thing i notice is the strafe jump at the launch makes me go over the 400 range, then i'm sure i'm not bhop'n right as it goes way down under the 300 range. Either i need to use some sprint or i'm just way out of sync with the jumping and button combo. Also this is using 150 gravity setting.<br>

ptrain is a good map to practising strafe jumps on. you could start off with 400 grav, see how far you get, then change to 500 repeat, then 600 repeat and practise like hell until you reach 11 and can clear it consistently, at this point your strafe jump should be good enough to produce an enough speed for the initial jump of your bhop.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I would suggest you learn on regular 600 gravity.  I say this again due to  the amount of time in the air. On 150 gravity airtime is much longer and therefore easier to prepare for your next jump so when you are on 600 grav everything seems to happen much faster.  But if you start out on 600 gravity and get the timing of the jumps right its much easier to carry that over to even lower gravity.<br>

	<div class="content">killer, maybe make a demo on caverns... most folks here will have that map.<br>
<br>
although i do practice strafe jumping and bhopping on the various jump maps... i like practicing more on the actual maps i'll be playing.  helps to familiarize me with the maps overall.<br>
<br>
i used to use lockdown exclusively.  but caverns has some really good strafe jumps to practice.  the easier strafe jumps to begin with are from the bridge to top rpg to the ledge to control... making a circuit you can practice over and over.  also ramp to redroom, back and forth... makes you contend with a railing in mid jump.  bathroom to front mag, back and forth.<br>
<br>
the tougher strafe jumps on caverns are from front mag to top of supercharger over to balcony and back to top of supercharger.  and also the jump from the bridge between front mag and crossbow room to the ledge over back shotty/mag.  that one requires air control to bend around a corner.  fun stuff.<br>
<br>
there's also plenty of space to practice bhop timing as you move around the map.<br>
<br>
my strafe jump has greatly improved practicing on caverns.  my bhop still needs a LOT of work... i struggle with the timing.  i have found it very useful to have a mentor on the server with you... someone who can spectate and give pointers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Try using your mouse a little more to turn in the air after all that's where the speed comes from.<br>
easy way to do this is to hold down one strafe key then smoothly and consistantly turn mouse in the same direction, yes you will go round in circles.<br>
Hopefully this demo will be of use to you I used the same map and gravity I think.<br>

Still practicing on it now, though now i can speed crawl foward and backwards now. Backwards is pretty funny when people see it done. Well back to practicing.<br>

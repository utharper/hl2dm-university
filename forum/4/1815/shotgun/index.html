	<div class="content">ok 2 Q's, i think there has been a thread like this, but i cant find it<br>
<br>
1)what does everyone use, single shot or dlb secondary shot? i find myself always using the double barrel, but does not seem to do much. is the dbl barrel spray that much better than the single shot spray? everyone uses the shotgun, but i usually tend to stay away from the gun cuz it never really helps.<br>
<br>
2)what is the best technique to avoid a shotgun blast? i think i have pretty good mvoement and can jump out of the way for some shots, but for most i find myself screwed when someone whips one out. so run away? stay and fight? idk...i know it depends on how much health you have or what weapon, respawn, etc...<br>
<br>
stretch<br>
thx for the help</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I generally use 2,2,1,1. If you get what I mean =P<br>
But from time to time I use 3 double shotguns.<br>
<br>
Best way to survive against it? As you said depends on lots of stuff, but zman's advice is good. The farther u r, the less damage it will do (in theory).<br>
If you are close and have a very good movement (not good, very good), you might be able to make a good player miss one shot, maybe two, not always though.<br>
A good explosion can help to get the other's camera red (Dizzy?), also ar2 primary fire well used can be a pain in the ass, constantly red view and moving your camera &gt;.&lt;<br>

but there is that weird discrepancy... a single shot is 7 pellets while a double is only 12 pellets (instead of 14).  so technically, 2 single shots with all pellets on target should do more damage than one double with all pellets on target.<br>

	<div class="content">If you're a bit further away from someone elses fire fight, you can usually blast a double shot into the crowd and deal some maximum damage, this works well if people are hopping about as well as the further away you are, the larger the spread of bullets... having said that, I often find myself caught out reloading after 3 double shots, but by then its usually easier to just switch to the smg or whatever... <br>

Nothing like a point blank double to the face for maximum satisfaction though! Brings back fond Doom memories! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lolz prove it!! nobody has yet... only ghost stories.

Yes, I'm actually confused with it lately. Since I tried to do a close range (should I say point blanck?) shot with 2 barrels at the head of a 100hp/100a and got a 1 shot kill, with only a right mouse click... I don't know anymore if it does any more damage to press both buttons. I'm still not sure, but it seems to kill more effitiently than just a right click.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It seems they die more consisently in a WOW fashion when I put a little velocity into the shot by turning into it.  Hard to get use to, high dpi mice make it easy to throw your aim off.

I killed a Tiggy on Tigcrik_R2 the other day with 100-140 life in one shot, he was almost 180 degrees behind me if I remember right...I jumped, turned, boom, dead.  <br>
<br>
We can sit here and theorize all day about shotgun skillz, but I dont think anyone knows for sure.  If you want to get good with it, use it, go to a nub server and shoot the hell outta them trying it different ways, in a consisent manner to determine what seems more effective.<br>

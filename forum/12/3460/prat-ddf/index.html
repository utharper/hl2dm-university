	<div class="content">Given that I spend more and more time in this forum and start to post a bit, I wanted to indroduce myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all English is not my native langage so I do some mistakes, so try to be cool about that <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
<br>
So I'm 22. I'm French. IRL I'm a young engineer in computer science. So basically I code a bit, but I have let down it to specialize me in networks and telecommunications.<br>
<br>
Else I play HL2 for now 3 years and I have played HL1 for 5 years before. I played a bit in Quake 3 too and now when I don't play HL2 I go on Quake Live. I'm the coleader of the french team P!raT, but given that our Leader is inactive for more than a year it's me who mainly lead the team. I'm also one of the main admin of a quite new european HL2 league called "OFF" for "Owning For Fun". (<a href="http://www.off-league.com" class="postlink">www.off-league.com</a>). This league promotes 3 main values : a mapcycle instead of the homemaps, the choice to play with or without the RPG in the map you play as rebel, and a respectful behaviour between the clans.<br>
<br>
In my free time I try a lot of things around HL2. I take care of 7 servers ( 5 HL2, 2 Left For Dead). I have done 1 frag movie some months ago that you can download here. I have realised a remix of lockdown too more than 1 year ago (dm_lockdown_pirat).<br>
<br>
Today I have some other projects in progress. I have foreseen to redesign the website of my team, I have a 2nd frag movie that is begun at 10%, I have a 2nd map begun too and I'm even coding a short multiplayer mod for HL2. Unfortunaltely I have less free time than in the past so it's not always easy to manage to finish all that.<br>
<br>
It's not the 1st times I go in the U else. In the past I was (and I'm still) addicted to the frag movie section. But it's just that now I go more and more here to be a bit aware in what's going on in your side and also cuz what is done in the University interest me more and more given that I really think you do a good job.<br>
<br>
I think that's all.<br>
<br>

Well I introduce myself cuz it looks to be the habbit and cuz it has been reproached to me that I was posting some stuff whereas I was quite unknown and people didnt know how to take what I say.<br>

<br>
I introduce myself here by politeness.<br>
I introduce myself here cuz  the half life world has always been my passion and I think the U is a nice place for that.<br>
And I indroduce myself cuz each time I will finish a project (map, vid, league, etc...) I will introduce it here too.<br>
<br>
Obviously when you do some stuff for the community there are a lot of people who appreciate you and always few ones who dont. It's obviously for silly reasons cuz most of the time they want to do things for the community too. In the past I fought against them but with the years I have learnt to live with it and ignore them. Take this advice : all the time you can spend to fight the few people who dont appreciate you can be spend to help and take care of the ones who makes things progress in the good way and of the ones you appreciate and who appreciate you. It's so much more important <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
And well, finally, coming in an introduction subject just to say bad things on someone just show 2 points : the fact that you could have better used your time like I was precising it and the fact that you cant leave your bad behavior <br>
<br>
Anyway nice to meet you here Bush and Slagz, I didnt know you were around <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

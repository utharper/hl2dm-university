&gt;&gt;Dude, I do not play that well, first of all <br>
<br>
Second, <strong class="text-strong">it is</strong> actually important that people do know that I'm bisexual, I didn't go through a violent, emotionally turbulent, adolescence, to then have a couple jerk-wads say = "Hey...Hey....keep it to yourself please - or go somewhere else...like yahoo" - If I am to understand this place correctly, it does not discriminate based on *anything* let alone sexual preference.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the only reason I joined this damn forum was because I was mysteriously banned from the HL2DM official server - so please, save the lectures, chances are I know more about life than you people <br>
<br>
If the idea of two men making love does not sit well w/ you - uh...learn to deal? It's the world you live in...   <br>
And I do forget what exactly I said in my deleted post but I am fairly sure that Impala was the first to say "penis" on this thread - and when you need to know how to shut a bunch of straight boys up, trust me, that phrase works... <br>
<br>
Oh, and do learn what humor is people. Except for the posts(messages) between Modus and myself, I did a fairly good job of censoring my BSing. Oh, and for the record, Modus is a sexy-beast, yes, but is COMPLETELY straight... what a pity... <br>

<br>
All the pot/drugs/porn threads have nothing to do with DM. Why didn't anyone bitch about those? They were not beneficial at all to the game or forum at all. At least his post was introducing himself to the forum.<br>

This thread had more to do with DM than some other posts.<br>

I do not think sex related topics belong in a game related forum. reading these lines disgust me and there are smut forums for that and whoever wants to "shock" ppl with their sexuality should go there where there is crowd for this type of attitude. new guy's beahviour doesn't fly with me, not on my servers nor here. im not trying to insult anyone: i think he is insulting himself. everytime ive confronted him on server about this crap talking he chose to call it humor. hell no one was laughing. wtf does the size of anyone's #$^&amp; have to do with playing an online game pray tell?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Half of the threads in the cafeteria don't deal with DM gaming. There was a specific thread where someone posted the girl and the guy having sex and the guy yelling. You guys didn't say that thread should be deleted. Was that in humor? Yeah, was the new guy trying to be funny? I didn't find laughter in it, but he said he was. Another point I have to make is if a girl said she was lesbian, I believe most of the guys would make some type of sexual innuendo and nobody would care.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Only because it had a warning that said 18+ I didn't say anything. It at least warned that some people might not want to see it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No. I just didn't bitch about that other thread because there was a warning. I actually like New Guy and like his attitude. He doesn't go around like some people, " 1 v 1 pussy or you're a n00b and blah blah blah."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You make all good points Impala. The only thing is I don't really know if he is joking or not and I'm not sure anyone but him can say if he is joking or not. Either way I still like him and back him up 100%.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Impala, you were always fun to play - and its pretty easy to ignore the penis stuff, it is <br>
<br>
Valar, you're a goody-two-shoes and everyone knows this, <br>
    and although you never pissed me off directly, when you and your clan got rid of Marie I started not to like you <br>
<br>
Cyberclash...Thank you for backing me up but at the same time you don't want to stick by me, chances are - you don't really wanna <br>
    unless you know the risks - I'm a white Bisexual male who loves cats and lifts weights as a hobby - not too many groups/labels fit me<br>
<br>
...†h3 Nèw Ġuy`™ is a loner, plain and simple, and you all need to lighten up...<br>
<br>
Do I act this way in person? Fuck no, but you see - and omfg - you see, the internet is NOT personal, it is NOT real life<br>
I act this way because I can, this GAME, this DM is a joke, a pointless diversion, which I originally started playing because I realized I got it free w/ HL2 and it kept my hands busy so I didn't whack off and waste myself.<br>
<br>
Oh, and guees what? wathcing people play DM is like watching people masturbate<br>
----&gt;Wow, so your good at it but.....who cares? who really cares? Who's gonna pay to watch? Who will admire and look up to you?<br>
<br>
No one *actually* admires a game of soggy waffle, and no one *actually* admires HL2DM - except sickos, on both counts<br>
<br>
Its just a game people, for dumbass young people, and guess what? I like being dumb once in awhile - it's liberating, so fuck yall.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That other thread mentioned clearly had an 18+ warning on it. If it didn't have that it would have been deleted. It was fairly obvious that it was posted in humor and not to spam the forums with porn.<br>
<br>
I will remind everyone to re-read the mission of the site. HL2DMU is not the place to air your grievances against others just because we try not to over-moderate.

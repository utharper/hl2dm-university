	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">I was playing my usual map last night, Overwatch, and this guy named Briggs is offering 'lessons' to everyone in there. Finding this to be pretty annoying, and myself having been ranked #1 multiple times on multiple servers, I challenge him to a 1v1 match and he accepts.<br>
<br>
I get out of the game and find that, in talking to him, he wants to play a map other than the one we were just in, and despite my complete unfamiliarity with that map, I agree to play a match with him in it on the grounds that he plays a match with ME on overwatch. So we agree to two matches to 20; one on Overwatch, one on Lockdown.<br>
<br>
But then he says that his server is occupied and we will be able to play 'soon.' So to waste some time, we go back to the server we were in before while we wait. I proceed to climb to the top of the scoreboard and then ask Briggs again, after no less than 10 minutes, when we will be able to start our matches. He then leaves the game and sends me more messages, forcing ME to leave the game to check them.<br>
<br>
At this point he proceeds to explain that he thought we just played our overwatch match (with about 5 other people) and that we should now proceed to lockdown. I disagree but offer him, if he'd like, the opportunity to play lockdown FIRST instead of overwatch. He declines. Then he proceeds to make excuses about misunderstandings or something or another. Also, with poor spelling. I have a transcript if anyone would like to see it. Unmodified, of course.<br>
<br>
The point is, I challenged him to an Overwatch match because he seemed to think he was pretty good and he was, well, on Overwatch. After agreeing but then watching me more closely, he seems, at least in my estimation, to have lost his nerve. But I'm still looking for someone; anyone; who would like to play me in a 1v1 match on Overwatch. The standard competition is pretty poor. <br>
<br>
I can't supply the server, but I'll happily supply my A-game to anyone who wants to take me up on this. And if not, that's fine too. Like I told Briggs oh-so-many times, I'm just looking for a game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

actually I did not want to play over watch with him, I asked to help him, and that is what HE wanted(1v1overwatch), he said he had been playing 4 years at first... then later he said about 3 years, then after I saw him playing this game like CSS I offered to help with his movement, and in the mist of all this, he assumed I was calling him a bad player and wanted a fight , and thats it. then I even offered to ask some friends to fight him because he said " I just really want a match thats all" :roll: , and now here he is. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">btw, here is the full convo. You can read it for yourself. Right before it starts, he and I were playing a game and I left due to network issues that turned out to stem from the fact that I was accidently on wireless and Steam wasn't using my wired networking card:<br>
<br>
 Never tell your password to anyone.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: Wait a bit.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: what map do you want besides overwatch<br>
cjpbob: overwatch<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: to bad<br>
cjpbob: what?<br>
cjpbob: its the most played map on HL2DM<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: no its not, you just play it the most<br>
cjpbob: yes it is.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: sure<br>
cjpbob: but overwatch<br>
cjpbob: is the most<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: nope, only the socal servers have that on 24/7<br>
cjpbob: yeah....<br>
cjpbob: how many 24/7 lockdown servers are there? or runoff?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: almost 0<br>
cjpbob: exactly.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: mostly killboxes sadly<br>
cjpbob: yeah<br>
cjpbob: which are awful<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: agreed<br>
cjpbob: hang on just a minute. i'm gonna restart my router<br>
cjpbob: AGAIN<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: ok,<br>
Lost connection to Steam, will rejoin chat automatically when connection regained.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs is now Offline.<br>
Connected again and rejoined chat.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs is now Online.<br>
cjpbob: ok<br>
cjpbob: now lets see<br>
cjpbob: if you want to play, start an overwatch map and invite me.<br>
cjpbob: i'll run around a bit to see if the connection is to my satisfaction. once I say it is, game on. i wont be trying to kill you anytime before that.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: not overwatch<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: lockdown<br>
cjpbob: no. way too big.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: hah<br>
cjpbob: i dont really need to get balled constantly<br>
cjpbob: which is what would happen<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I only play CAL maps<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: that is the agreement for me having my own server<br>
cjpbob: CAL?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: -_-<br>
cjpbob: whats the difference between lockdown and overwatch? besides, its private<br>
cjpbob: are you going to play me or not?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: lockdown is what I play<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: sorry<br>
cjpbob: well we were both on OW when i challenged you to this duel<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: that means nothing, I can tell you have not done this may times before<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: lockdown<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: is the 1v1 map<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: period<br>
cjpbob: how? thats the shittiest 1v1 map ever<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: thats how its always been<br>
cjpbob: its impossible to track anyone, it has way too much energy, and way too many alt fires for the AR2<br>
cjpbob: and dont talk to me like you've been playing longer than I have<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: wow<br>
cjpbob: seeing who can bounce the most energy balls around is fun and all<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: go to hl2dm-university.com and learn to play the game before you chaleng me so I dont need to put up with this<br>
cjpbob: start an overwatch map and actually play me<br>
cjpbob: you will be destroyed<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I did not talk to you like I have played the game longer<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: that map<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: is a race to the rpg<br>
cjpbob: oh you mean like<br>
cjpbob: try to maintain a strategic position with the best gun?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: thats lockdown for ya<br>
cjpbob: how about this. you start the map and i'll wait until you have the RPG and then i'll come after you<br>
cjpbob: i'll let you win the 'race'<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: no<br>
cjpbob: no?<br>
cjpbob: well now you're just being a coward<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: if you where better at teh game then me<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: then you would know this, and<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: would beat me<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: on anymap<br>

cjpbob: hey, you offered to teach and I said I didn't need it. and I said i'd happily demonstrate and you agreed and offered to host a 1v1 game. are we going to play or not?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you did not say it like that <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
cjpbob: but thats what happened. and then we agreed to terms of the match.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: lockdown, because<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: ow is a pub<br>
cjpbob: and now you're saying you dont want to after playing casually with me for a few minutes.<br>
cjpbob: NO we agreed. OW then LD<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: because a cal match is in progress<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and we just played ow anyway<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and I had top, and i was afk for a few<br>
cjpbob: not 1v1 like we said.<br>

[FLaS] Briggs: ha!<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: this is a joke<br>
cjpbob: dude, you agreed to 2 matches. are we going to play them or not?<br>
cjpbob: cause from this end, it seems like you agreed to play a match, then played casually with me for a minute, got scared, and are now backing out. you wouldn't back out of a match you agreed to because you think you might lose, would you?<br>
cjpbob: thats not too sportsmanlike<br>
cjpbob: to 20 on overwatch then to 20 on lockdown<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: cjpbob: cause from this end, it seems like you agreed to play a match, then played casually with me for a minute, got scared, and are now backing out. you wouldn't back out of a match you agreed to because you think you might lose, would you?<br>
cjpbob: one for me and one for you; one on one all the way.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: your kidding<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
[FLaS] Briggs: if you keep doing this<br>
cjpbob: you going to play me tonight? or not?<br>
cjpbob: i'm just asking. cause 'soon' has long passed.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: im not even going to bother iwth you, and you can go and think whatever you want<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: tell all your friends<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: etc.<br>
cjpbob: we're in to 'in a bit' territory<br>
cjpbob: coming up on 'a while'<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: im sorry, I did not expect them to have a match<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: so stop your bitchen unless you have a server<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: gl hf<br>
cjpbob: ok, i'll tell you what. i'll just wait for you to tell me you've started a match<br>
cjpbob: overwatch, one on one.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: wow<br>
cjpbob: fine, want to do LD first? i'll let you go back on that little bit of what you said if you'd like.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: no<br>
cjpbob: ok<br>
cjpbob: then let me know where to go.<br>
cjpbob: when its ready<br>
cjpbob: i'm only going to wait until midnight. which is like 35 minutes if you're not in my time zone.<br>
cjpbob: but that seems pretty reasonable.<br>
cjpbob: already waited like 15 or 20 and no match to 20 takes an hour.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you know, I have offered so much, you call me sportsmanlike and I am doing my best, you are the one who turned this around, I noticed that I could help you, and you assumed it was becasue of score<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: now I cant controle when we 1v1<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and you will not shut up about it<br>
cjpbob: you can't help me. and i'm trying to demonstrate that to you.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: ok<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: then you know everyrthing<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: awsome<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: just like<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you know lockdown<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: good one<br>
cjpbob: are we going to play the matches you said we'd play? just a yes or no. either is fine. just tell me whether you still want to.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I know all about this game! I only play overwatch because there is a rpg on the top of the bulding!<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and thats it for you<br>
cjpbob: hey, i agreed to play lockdown with you<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: but<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you see<br>
cjpbob: which i already know you will likely win<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: if you loos<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I know the outcome<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: its not gana chang<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you say<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: im on my laptop<br>

[FLaS] Briggs: lol<br>
cjpbob: i will play you<br>

[FLaS] Briggs: but you are done<br>
cjpbob: dude, just play the matches with me. no talking during them if you want.<br>
cjpbob: i'm not going to make excuses. i know i'm ill-equipped to play lockdown and i'll likely lose.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I cant spell at all<br>
cjpbob: but i'll play it because its only fair<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: go ahead and make fun of that lol<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: hahahahah<br>
cjpbob: if i can pick a map then so can you<br>
cjpbob: thats completely fair<br>
cjpbob: two matches, each one of us gets to pick a map.<br>
cjpbob: thats as fair as you can make it<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: wow<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: even after you stated all your problems<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and un knowing of the map<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: its fare?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: ha<br>
cjpbob: yeah, it's fair<br>
cjpbob: if its a contest of HL2DM ability<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: no its not<br>
cjpbob: then it makes sense that we should each get to pick one map<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: knowing the stalk maps<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: is hl2dm ability<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you gata play this YOUR way to do this to, and I only asked that we do any other map<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: then ow<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: but you dont know then<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: suprize!<br>
cjpbob: ok listen. you agreed to play a match on overwatch and then a match on lockdown. that was perfectly fair and reasonable. are those matches going to happen or not?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: jeez<br>
cjpbob: i said i'd play lockdown<br>
cjpbob: OW then LD<br>
cjpbob: or the other way around if you prefer<br>
cjpbob: but if you're not going to play, then tell me so i can stop waiting<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: wow, you realy are not listaning<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: im doing the best of my ability to help you<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and you will not stop pushing your way<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: sorry<br>
cjpbob: i'm not looking for help. i'm just looking for a game. a game you said you'd play<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: but if you dont stop<br>
cjpbob: fine. i'll just sit quietly and wait. you let me know when there's an overwatch map (to be followed by a lockdown map) for me to play you in.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: then go look somwhere els, im not gana fight someone who is on a laptop+done not know the maps+cant speedskate+has bad interenet<br>

[FLaS] Briggs: I dont have a web site<br>

cjpbob: can I just challenge the whole forum?<br>
cjpbob: no one has to take me up on it<br>
cjpbob: i just want someone who is decent who will play me<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: on ow?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: sure<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I know some people who may<br>

[FLaS] Briggs: I';ll ask some friends<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: if you want a match<br>
cjpbob: please do. i'll look forward to hearing from them<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: ok, I also like the fact that because I said you cant beat me, that you conculded that I said you are bad player<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you do have lots to learn<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
cjpbob: i can beat you.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and im not always talking about<br>
cjpbob: and have<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: wtf<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and have<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: my ass<br>
cjpbob: every time we've been in a map together, i've killed more people than you<br>
cjpbob: and killed you more than you killed me<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: we have not had 1v1 yety<br>
cjpbob: and since you won't play me any more<br>
cjpbob: its ok<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: wow<br>
cjpbob: just find someone who is ok who will play me<br>
cjpbob: i dont care<br>
cjpbob: wish I hadn't wasted so much time with this<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: same<br>
cjpbob: but i'll just challenge the forum<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you cant<br>
cjpbob: its ok if you don't want to<br>
cjpbob: why?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: not by your standerds<br>
cjpbob: sure I can<br>
cjpbob: is there anyone man enough to play me in a 1v1 match to 20 on overwatch? just like that.<br>
cjpbob: no one even has to say anything if they dont want<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: just like that<br>
cjpbob: im not going to call anyone out cause I dont know anyone<br>
cjpbob: but if there's someone out there who thinks they can beat me, i'd like to play them<br>
cjpbob: that's all. and hell, maybe they CAN beat me<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: but only one overwatch?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: right?<br>
cjpbob: thats all I'm concered with. I'm making the challenge. i don't have to accept terms from others. no one HAS to play me.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: [FLaS] Briggs: but only one overwatch?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: right?<br>
cjpbob: right.<br>
cjpbob: yes.<br>
cjpbob: DOES ANYONE THINK THEY CAN BEAT ME IN A 1V1 MATCH ON OVERWATCH?<br>
cjpbob: PM WITH TIME AND SERVER.<br>
cjpbob: that's all<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: if you think you can only beat people on overwatch<br>
cjpbob: uh, yes.<br>
cjpbob: thats the map I play.<br>
cjpbob: so yes.<br>
cjpbob: why would I want to challenge them on other maps?<br>
cjpbob: i will lose and I know that already<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: .........<br>
cjpbob: i want to see if there's anyone as good as me for overwatch<br>
cjpbob: that's the whole point<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: oh!<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you said the game<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: not the map<br>
cjpbob: you seemed like you thought you were pretty good, offering lessons and whatnot<br>
cjpbob: so i challenged you<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: and I said I was good<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: but I dont play that map<br>
cjpbob: but when i left the game I found that you wanted to play a different map than the one we were in when i challenged you.<br>
cjpbob: fine<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you dont play ANYMAP<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: but that one<br>
cjpbob: not really. what the fuck is so difficult to understand?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: thats what I'm wondering<br>
cjpbob: have I ever expressed any desire to play a map other than overwatch, other than in my concession to you to play lockdown?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you thought that playing that map will show overall skill in the game<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: so yes<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: but then<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you said<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you will loos on any other map<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you know that for sure<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: so<br>
cjpbob: yeah, i will. i'm unfamiliar with them<br>
cjpbob: if i played them as much as I do overwatch, i'd be fine<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: adn that the only map you play<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: shows true skill in the game<br>
cjpbob: show me where I said that.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you said<br>
cjpbob: i just wanted to play you cause you thought you were good enough to have something to teach me<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: "hl2dm ability"<br>
cjpbob: yeah but that was just when i was talking about NOT showing any<br>
cjpbob: while i tested my internet connection<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: well, you are not gana get the overwatch compitition out of me, not because I am chicken, but because its not a 1v1 map, I need to play the cal maps to get better, I have said that so may times now,<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I will get some one<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: who will fight you<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: on overwatch<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: if that makes you happy<br>
cjpbob: i'm already asking the forum<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: let me guss<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: you are also talking about me not fighting you?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: on overwatch<br>
cjpbob: nah<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: see what happends when I try to help somone... you still want help with your movement?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: I am still willing to help<br>
cjpbob: my movement is fine.<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: prissing W?<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: good juobe<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: jobe<br>
cjpbob: i haven't seen anything that tells me you're better<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: job<br>
[FLaS] Briggs: hahaha<br>
cjpbob: like that one time i gave you a cabinet<br>
cjpbob: and then you came for me<br>

I don't have any demonstrations per se, but I can give you my stats from the four servers (Overwatch-only, of course) that I play on the most:<br>
<br>
Socal Mini (8 max)<br>
1/443 with 3522 kills, 732 deaths, K:D of 4.81<br>
<br>
Socal #1 (16 max)<br>
30/689 with 161 kills, 43 deaths, K:D of 3.74<br>
<br>
Socal #2 (16)<br>
84/676 with 20 kills, 15 deaths, K:D of 1.33<br>
<br>
22g (16)<br>
20/372 with 11 kills, 2 deaths, K:D of 5.5<br>
<br>
In case you're wondering, that means I have an overall K:D of <strong class="text-strong">4.69 across all 3714 recorded kills</strong> on those four servers. And of the <strong class="text-strong">2180</strong> people who play on these often enough to be tracked, my stats are better than <strong class="text-strong">2045</strong> of them; across the board.<br>
<br>
But I'm sure you were looking for a youTube video or something. Afraid the best I can offer is a 'hands-on' demonstration.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It would have been kind of funny maybe if it wasn't so flamingly internet-cliche. It is funny, however, that I'm pretty sure I've played with that guy before and he seems to pretty much always talk like that. Especially when he's getting blown off maps. By me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't have any demonstrations per se, but I can give you my stats from the four servers (Overwatch-only, of course) that I play on the most:<br>
<br>
Socal Mini (8 max)<br>
1/443 with 3522 kills, 732 deaths, K:D of 4.81<br>
<br>
Socal #1 (16 max)<br>
30/689 with 161 kills, 43 deaths, K:D of 3.74<br>
<br>
Socal #2 (16)<br>
84/676 with 20 kills, 15 deaths, K:D of 1.33<br>
<br>
22g (16)<br>
20/372 with 11 kills, 2 deaths, K:D of 5.5<br>
<br>
In case you're wondering, that means I have an overall K:D of <strong class="text-strong">4.69 across all 3714 recorded kills</strong> on those four servers. And of the <strong class="text-strong">2180</strong> people who play on these often enough to be tracked, my stats are better than <strong class="text-strong">2045</strong> of them; across the board.<br>
<br>
But I'm sure you were looking for a youTube video or something. Afraid the best I can offer is a 'hands-on' demonstration.</div></blockquote>I will play you in a 1v1 and see how much your stats matter, add me to steam friends "blasphemysquad".</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
the posters here at this site (for the most part) are for the preservation for a dying unapreciated game. <br>
Take a look around at teh resources and time spent in the crafting of instructional manuals, the demo's for down load, the draft night they set up to encourage people to play freiendly games togeather, regardless of their clan affiliation....<br>
<br>
there is a motto i've come to apreciate.<br>
don't pwn the noobs, teach them to survive.<br>
<br>
what you may take as an insult was meant as an olive branch from briggs, an offering to help improve your game. <br>
from that percieved insult you wanted to prove something. So win, lose, or draw in a 1v1 match vs these doods on this site, can you honeslty say that you're game is good enough that there is no need for any improvement? Why is it hard for you to accept help? I have learned a lot from these players, recognizing that there is pretty much always room for improvement. <br>
<br>
to come on this site and have a "fuck you i don't need your help" attitude wreaks of an arrogance i'm sure people are chomping at the bit to knock you down a level.  <br>
try and remember it's a game meant for fun.<br>
good luck out there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Briggs I am just amazed at your patience with this guy, I would have said peace WAY before the halfway mark on that chat log lol.  I got frustrated just reading it, no way was I gonna finish it ahah.  You just majored in making an ass out of you self at the hl2dmu lol cjbb whatever your name is.  Being a cocky m'fer is really a great way to alienate yourself from IMO the strongest community of gamers left in hl2dm...good work.  If I didn't play any other servers but those servers I'm sure I too would be #1.  Overwatch 24/7 hmmm, SLAM the stair case and spam the rocket, collect xbow, mag, CB rifle, xbow health pack inbetween spam sessions, rinse, repeat.  Not that hard to dominate on an overwatch pub dude. I might think something of those stats if they were on servers that acctually have a variety of maps that diversify the gameplay in order to give varying play styles advantages/disadvantages througout the map cycle.  But dominating on overwatch only proves your probly pretty good with the rocket.  Its really too bad you've taken such a negative out look on this situtation, Briggs is a damn good player and defiately could have taught you a lot from the sound of things.  We here at the U are about educating people who are interested in learning more about the game and improving their ability.  This site is devoted to keeping a withering gaming commmunity alive, we're not going to alienate ANYONE, unless they have an incredibly bad attitude.

	<div class="content">umm, i mean correct me if i'm wrong, but i think that briggs is the one being a prick to this guy.  I mean come on if you know he is new and needs/could use help, then one thing you should/would know is he is gonna think his pub stats matter, until shorty after that first 1v1 or tdm match or whatever.  So he is gonna be cocky up until that point....so i would have taken eventhing he said as a grain of salt because after the 1v1 things would be different, and if he is still willing to talk to you then he would likely ask for more help.  I don't see why you wouldn't play ow it's fine 1v1.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure more was said before the convo posted, but you instantly so no to his map,  then talk about CAL ? sure use a standard to play but why should he know anything about it?  In my exp.  just play the 1v1 in whatever rules they want, win and thus crush the ego trip from the pub then you can teach all you want, and he will be more willing to listen.<br>

<br>
I understand,  and i agree, but i think the best way is to let him talk, then do the 1v1 and let that do your talking. Then he'd be more willing to learn and get better maybe even join a league or team at some point.  No offense to anyone but it sounds like Joule when he use to challenge people to "1v1" on a pub Overwatch server.   And would likely sound like me if you challenged me to a 1v1 at the war room server before wRw<br>

I think OV is a really fun 1v1 map. <br>
<br>
I stopped reading the convo as it's basically same shit repeated with different words over and over.<br>
<br>
Being challenged and then the guy's like ''ops my server is busy'' is lamo.<br>
<br>
I understand briggs frustration as he felt potential in a player that wasn't interested of taking the game to another level but that's also something to respect.<br>
<br>
I don't see it as a who was right or wrong in this convo, both of you guys could probably kick back and laugh at the ridiculous proportion a match on overwatch has taken.<br>
<br>
Also.<br>
<br>
Lockdown isn't TEH 1v1 map.<br>
<br>
people just whored it 24/7 because there was nothing else and everyone got ridiculously good at it.<br>
<br>
If lockdown woudlve been custom and released after 3 years peopl wouldve prolly be like ''i dont play lockdown 1v1, ill only play you on dm_whatever, its TEH 1v1 map''<br>

Just play him already and if you get schooled learn from it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

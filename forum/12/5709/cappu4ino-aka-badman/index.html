	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Introducing:</strong><br>
Hello everybody, my name is Boris, nickname Cappu4ino (in russian language first letter of 4 is ch, so this nickname reads as "Cappuccino") aka Badman.<br>
<br>
I was born in 1991, so I'm 19 years old now.<br>
<br>
I started to play HL2:DM in 2005-2006. This game was purely fun for me, so there was now serious attitude from me.<br>
Simple day, 2006, September:<br>
I'm join public server that running dm_overwatch, 10-12 players, and I get the top among all this people.<br>
So I was very naive, and I ran to the "Stream arena" ( it was very popular Russian hl2dm forum in 2005-2007) forum, to brag about my "skill".<br>
<br>
After my unsuccessful gaming practice, I started to engage in mapping.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CHAPTER ONE <br>
"Constructive thinking"</strong><br>
<br>
When I was about 2-3 years our family was living hubly. So they couldn't buy to me any cool toys, or to make me a lot of presents.<br>
But once day, they presented me Lego game designer.<br>
It was a big kit for making buildings. So it was my basic occupation till I seven years old.<br>
Construction became my favorite thing, so I caused my interest to the mapping and level design.<br>
<br>
In the end of 2007 I started to learn source mapping. I made maps for HL2, I didn't published them, it was only for me. Later I started to make maps for hl2dm.<br>
I was a kid, so I not taken root in hl2dm society, and players were not delighted by my maps.<br>
Ragequit from HL2DM world and Source mapping.<br>
<br>
In the beggining of 2008 I started to learn Sandbox 1\2 (used to create maps for the CryEngine: FarCry, Crysis).<br>
It is better then source sdk, because it have real-time rendering, and you can test your maps without entering any game.<br>
It was a lot of fun again, but it became not so interesting as it was earlier.<br>
<br>
Then I started to leave CryGames, and I forgot about my PC and any games for some time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">CHAPTER TWO<br>
"Mapping put me on the game"</strong><br>
Year 2010. I came back to my PC. I was customising my desktop, and I found cool wallpapers with "Krak des Chevaliers" castle in Syria.<br>
It was amazing for me, and very interesting to visit it, to look on it with my own eyes.<br>
Subsequently I decided to create a map with catle theme. Only Source Sdk knowleges could let me to realise my idea.<br>
I started to make dm_undercastle. I was spending a lot of my time to this map, and sometimes I was very tired because of it.<br>
And once day, I visited hl2dm public, I just wanted to relax. I was visited in the "Warriors of 3D clan" on this public. After I entered it, players there, started to train me hard.<br>
I started to use my brain in games, and left behind my public games, so I played only 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4.<br>
So I found players who will help me to test my maps, in that way I met aforizm, he was playing in Lsd at that time.<br>
He helped me to make a lot of maps, so thanks to him. <br>
We published dm_undercastle_r1 on HL2DMU, CU, FPS banana, and after people said that they like it, I decided to continue my mapping growth.<br>
<br>
I played HL2DM, started to play in CU 1v1, met some interesting people like Abnoksius (don't sure about this is right name), Swot, haL.<br>
I have a lot of good maps, and some of them are in CU maplists now.<br>
I like this game, and don't want to leave it.<br>
Glad to meen all you here, thanks for you to playing this game, we'r family, we are part of this virtual world.<br>
<br>
Best regards, Badman.<br>

	<div class="content">Greetings, Sir<br>
<br>
...welcome, and I hope to continue to read your posts that make such strong points in the future<br>
<br>
And would also like to, maybe....slightly....perhaps....<br>
apolo....gize......or some...thing......<br>
<br>
*sigh*  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> <br>
<br>
I would like to apologize if I upset you w/ my own introduction thread, but I am only apologizing to you, <br>
Everyone else that didn't like it can eat me......and eat me RAW... <br>
<br>
I treated this forum as if it were hosted and used solely by the guys at rL, and it is not. Therefore I was wrong to behave in such a manner and make such comments that people probably did not expect at all from an introduction ...of sorts.<br>
<br>
Again, I'm still only apologizing to Impala here, and I am apologizing for how I treated him in that thread.<br>
<br>
I am indeed a grown man and I know when I am wrong. <br>
In person, I am 6'2'' 246lbs and I'm able to use my guile, physical presence, and sly mannerisms to push the limits of the subject matter I speak of to the faces of the people I meet. It always goes smoothly mind you.<br>
<br>
Over the internet, however, I have struggled to adapt to this....."cyber-culture" and what-not.<br>
I also am exponentially more blunt over the internet and especially in-game, than I am in person of course. <br>
However, Impala, I do recommend you play me in other servers now, most people have found that over a microphone my humor is a lot easier to detect, and easier for me to be more original and creative - since I am not that good of a typer. <br>
-&gt;For those who don't know, [XDS] servers do not support Voice-Chat.<br>
<br>
However, that being said, If you get a headshot on me from across the map like you did the last time we played I probably will call you something like: "Oh, blow me you pigeon fucking, douche lick..." or maybe I'll just say "Lies" - all in perfect jest, and you'll probably take it as a compliment because over a mic, my delivery sells a lot of things real well. <br>
<br>
But should anybody, at all, find that they do not like my behavior in-game = muting me is indeed a great option, I mean really its great.     <br>
<br>
And always Keep it Real people<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Thanks New Guy. I have never had a problem with you in game and i encourage folks to have fun. <br>
I guess i am an old school prude. I remember playing several times when the chat turned freaky/sexual/gay... whatever, and it turned me off.<br>
I have never felt a person's sexuality is what is really special about them.<br>
I have never thought a person's sex life was anything other than private.<br>
I do not judge folks about their sexuality.<br>
It is their own business and none of mine.<br>
<br>
Thought it better to dialogue this rather than flame, that is all.<br>
Good Luck to you and hope you continue to enjoy the game.<br>
And i will definitely headshot you next time i see you.<br>

Also, I have left XDS.<br>
They are a great bunch and i wish them the best.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol...<br>

Keep in mind, I'm a person who did not know that owned was now spell w/ a "p" until July of last year. <br>
On that more invasive thread of mine, I thought Modus was making a gay reference w/ the whole "flaming" thing...or "flame wars" I think it was.<br>
Can someone help a brotha out w/ this Internet terminology? <br>
<br>
Oh, and it's fine to be prude, prude people generally tip really well so thats nice I guess.<br>

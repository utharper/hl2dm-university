	<div class="content">Hello everyone, I'm [SS]KaBoOm. I'm kind of new to the Half Life 2 Deathmatch University. I have been on here before looking at the latest and greatest tips and tricks and how to improve my game. I've been playing games most of my life, but HL2DM is one of my all time favorites. The days I'd skip high school and stay at my friends house playing the original Half Life and having a good ol time lol!<br>
<br>
Main reason for writing on here is I feel like I'm the only one in the state of Hawaii that plays hl2dm to be honest with you and I've been trying to meet some fellow Hawaii players for a long time.<br>
<br>
I am obviously affiliated and a proud member of the Senior Slayers, and have been a member for almost a year. I have had the pleasure of playing with many people from all around the world and different clans out there such as [SS], [FF], [MB], {BB}, {EE}, [MF], |911|, etc and have nothing but good things to say. Except those |911| guys lol! Honestly though, very good guys and skilled players as the rest of the clans I have mentioned above. <br>
<br>
I really like how the Half Life community is at keeping the game alive and just wanted to stop by and say hello to all you guys. I may know some of you already, but if I don't just add me! Anyways, much mahalo and aloha!<br>

Not a problem. I've played with Viper, you, El Prez, Richmankiller and a few more, sorry I forgot, and everyone was friendly and great. Didn't have an attitude like some of the other better players I've played with! Always fun and good seeing you guys around!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for the warm welcome everyone. We finished a scrim a little while ago against the Malachie Brothers [MB] and wanted to say it was some good fun. If anyone else would like or consider a scrim against the Senior Slayers [SS] just get a hold of [SS]Asst.Mooseman and talk to him. Again thanks for the warm welcome and aloha.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

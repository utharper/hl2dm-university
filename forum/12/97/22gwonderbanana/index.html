	<div class="content">Hi all  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
I usually play as Wonderbanana or Nana (or some fruity variation!) and I am a member of the 22nd Global Gaming Clan, or 22g as its known.  The clan website can be found here: <a href="http://22g.co.uk/forum/index.php" class="postlink">http://22g.co.uk/forum/index.php</a><br>
<br>
22g is a community of gamers (most HL2DM based) with an emphasis on promoting a fun based enviroment suitable for players of all skill and free from harassment.  22g currently have 5 popular HL2DM servers and one for CSS.<br>
<br>
I've been playing DM for quite a while now, and originally was attracted to 22g as initially I found some servers I'd been on before rather abusive to new players (i nearly gave the game up because of this).  <br>
<br>
Since then though, I've abandoned my water wings and now do my best to help others in the same way I was helped when I started.  And on that note, I think the site you have here is a superb idea and fantastic for the community, nice one and good luck with it!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

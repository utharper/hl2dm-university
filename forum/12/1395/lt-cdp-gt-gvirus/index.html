	<div class="content">Hey guys! What's up. I've been playing this over lan with my friends for a while and, well I got play over the internet and that guy named nino (or something similar to that) comes in and kicks our asses. We call him hacker and suspect the guy really does since he's moving fast and weirdly and all. Plus he was kicking our asses with a 56-2 score or something like that. Then the guy told us about advanded movement techniques and we felt pretty stupid for calling him a hacker. I mean, seriously we insult the guy and he kindly helps us figuring out advanced stuff in the game, then he told us about this site. Now I guess you guys know how I got introduced to this site and to the real awesomness behind hl2dm. Now I'm off to play some more, later!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I felt bad at first when you guys called me a hacker cuz you guys were having a good game on moodle,  Not the first times it's happen,  but you guys were willing to listen, and even stayed in the server to practice a few jumps. Instead of just being mad, and once you saw some of the advanced movement and weapon stuff you had fun trying them out.<br>
<br>
something about getting cursed out in french that always makes me lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

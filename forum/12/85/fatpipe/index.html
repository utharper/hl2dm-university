	<div class="content">I rent a chicago server from them for [VDuS], even though my latency is 55-60 on average, It feels smoother than our westcoast server where my average ping is 20-25 from GU  (we'll be switching from GU to fatpipe soon for westcoast as well)  Very fast tech support also, definately worth switching to or checking out.<br>
<br>
Also worth noting:   When steam delivers a big update to the client side that requires servers to update as well, fatpipe has an option to auto-update the server via command prompt + steam, after this most recent update vdus server was the only one up and running that day.

the auto update attribute for the command line is actually a feature of steam, and not fatpipe.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If your GSP doesnt allow you the option to edit your commandline they probably have no business renting servers. It would suprise me if your GSP offered start and stop controls.<br>

The last few days i've been working with my server a lot. The service from fatpipe servers is amazing. The pings are great, my FPS is higher then me on friday nights, the user panel is easy to navigate and full of options (seriously considering renting a second server just to see what my user panel would look like).<br>
<br>
Some minor compliants i have however are: My support ticket took 2 days to get a response, i understand they have 2 phone numbers you can call in the need of support, but i felt like being a douche and just submitted a ticket. <br>
<br>
On initial setup my FTP did not work, i had to upload several maps via the file manager (1 file at a time). Also my gravity was set to 800, and my sv_maxspeed was set to something like 270. Not that big of a deal but for someone new to hl2 like myself i had no idea what the problem was, and after reading how most of the fatpipestaff is made of "old  school halflife players" i didnt once think "hey maybe they screwed up the defaults in my config file".<br>
<br>
aside from the little bumps at start up, and a pretty repulsive website (sorry guys, but if your site was a chick, and i was drunk enough to sex her, i'd double wrap it) fatpipeservers is halflife 2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

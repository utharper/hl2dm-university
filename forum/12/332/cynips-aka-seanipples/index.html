	<div class="content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
had my eyes on this site a long time ago but just today realized you've got it fully up and running with forums and all.<br>
<br>
My HL2DM history is kinda unique in that I lived in the US (Riverside, CA) when HL2DM was released. So I started out from day 1 and played until August next year, no clan or anything, just pub playing and some early HL2CTF. Then I took a break that lasted about 10 months because I didn't have enough time to play when our second son was born. It was the FiOS tournament that made me take the game up again. I new I wasn't going to win but I didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to take part of such an historic event. Don't know if anyone remembers my name. I certainly remember my first opponent: Mario 64 Master <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> but at least he commended my RPG skills on steamlab <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br>
<br>
During the tournament my wife started taking an interest in the game, often watching me play through our TV which we had hooked up to the computer. After a while she started playing too (nick Pallas) as did our then 2 year old son Viktor.<br>
<br>
Later I was drafted by Bad Influence to his clan Non Stop Frag. Actually, it was when I played aim_arena on a pub that he noticed me. This clan eventually fell apart and from the remnants we formed CYD (Crafting Your Death) which never really took off.<br>
<br>
By the end of January this year I moved back to Sweden where I originally come from and soon joined up with girlie.se where I am currently leader of their team 2 (which participates in the Clans United tournament without much success).<br>
<br>
As a player I'm currently trying to learn bunny hopping, but it's a slow process partly because I was unable to decide on a setup that would suit my preferences. I think I'm finally getting there though. Part reason why I'm joinging this community is my determination to develop my movement skills. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I lived in Riverside for almost 3 years working as a postdoc - a very common next step after you get your PhD. Starting to  work some in just a few days, but I've been unemployed since February so I've had a little more time than usual to improve my DM skills. Not without it's complications though since I've changed both mouse, keyboard and quite a few binds in the process. Think I'm finally beginning to settle in at something that could last.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hello everyone.  My real name is Ryan.  as you can see from the thread title.... my game name is Elemental Dragon of KBH (how ya doin?).  You can just call me ED... cuts down on confusion and having to type my entire name out.<br>
<br>
You probably already know some of the other people of KBH, seeing as some of the others visit here.  When it comes to in-game..... i'm nothing like the rest.  a lot of people tend to constantly use the 357, or in less fun maps, the RPG.  I'm a complete stunstick whore.  I use guns on occasion... but the stunstick is just so much more reliable.  the only weapon that i use that has ranked up more kills than my stunstick is grenades.  don't believe me?<br>
<br>
<a href="http://stats.kbhclan.com/player.php?id=216" class="postlink">http://stats.kbhclan.com/player.php?id=216</a><br>
<br>
Anyway..... a lot of people find that i'm a riot to play with.... some find that i'm irritating as hell to play against (sad for them).... i just do it for the fun.  No other weapon is quite as fun as the stunstick.  It's just a thrill to chase down people you have trouble shooting (by the way, i kinda suck with the mag), and cream the hell out of them at close range.  People don't seem to expect it.... unless they've played me before.  Typically i'll use the stick if i feel ammo isn't entirely necessary to pull off what i'm trying to do.... which tends to be often.  Could also be just that i love using the stunstick.... either way it's still fun.  Even got a few KBH members, and a few of the other regulars that visit our servers to melee fight me if i approach them with the stick, but some know better after repeated beatings.  lol.<br>
<br>
Anyway..... If anyone ever wants a bit of a melee match... i'm game.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, he's one of the primary reasons I added JIHAD to my plugin.  Once he gets momentum going towards me with that stick I just overcook a grenade <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
Every once in a while he takes me out before I can complete it, but the nade still gets him.  I've got a new secret for him, just gotta find him in the servers.  muhwahahahahahah</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Charles:  our killbox servers would be fine.  the only place there are really any health kits are in the corners on the floor.... and usually if i'm going stick vs. stick with someone, i try as hard as i can NOT to grab health or armor to make it as fair a fight as possible.... even if i end up fighting two people and have damn near no health left.  Now.... if i'm going stick vs. gun..... that's a different story.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Would be nice though to have a map with a bunch of those floor conveyor belts and stuff to make you go fast.  dart around the map if you can bunny hop well... people won't know what the hell hit them.  Could make it have like an ice half-pipe.... can slide up and down the sides and stuff..... if that's possible, i dunno.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also, it'd make sense to spawn without the smg &amp; nades.<br>

Anyone up to the challenge?  I'd do it, but I'm not sure if I'll have time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

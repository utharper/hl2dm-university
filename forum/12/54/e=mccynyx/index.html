<br>
Hello all HL2DM University communauty,<br>
<br>
I am Cynyx, french man, 27 yo, clan leader of E=mc clan. Play HL2DM since 9 months and fall in love of this game. I come from Q3 ... and i found same sensations in HL2DM : nervous game.<br>
<br>
E=mc clan is a little familly (18 members), average skills, many (european) countries (France,Russian Federation, England). <a href="http://www.emc2-clan.com" class="postlink">http://www.emc2-clan.com</a><br>
<br>
Sorry for that <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">, I am essentially a killbox player (considerated as noob maps for some of pro players but it's really not my opinion)... but i try to play on classical map since some weeks.<br>
I'm an advanced player (but not more, not pro as many of u, i miss a lot of shot and i'm still to be slow <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused">  ) but i can do some tricks and i can do some bunny hoping.<br>
<br>
I think initiative of this university is great. In my opinion, there are no interest to humilliate newbie players. For example, i don't like players who make screenshots of big score and kpd with only newbies on server and leave when skilled players join them. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil">   <br>
<br>
Many times, I try to show all things i know. When i'm called cheater for example, i'm very happy if the player who said that called later by others cheater himself by others ! <br>
<br>
The main aim : have a better skilled communauty, and seems to be your philosophy. If HL2DM wants to survive, we need to have more members : not normal that HL2DM have 10 times less players than CSS (god i hate CSS...). Share skill for more funny games and for more challenges...  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You guys hate cs.. thats wierd<br>
<br>
CS requires more aim than HL2 ever would :l<br>
<br>
and i won a 1on1 cs tourny, won 550 (too bad i didnt save them for a fucking new cpu)<br>
<br>
its quite diferent.. the feel of making a hs in HL and in CS<br>
<br>
i play cs for .. makes 4 years in this june (early june)<br>
<br>
if valve fixed the 356 hitboxes i would make headshots like i do in cs, or maybe better, but untill then, no one can do a thing about it<br>
<br>
Remmeber, if you started playing the CS series, and started playing CSS, then you started on the wrong foot, CS 1.6 is the most played game in the world, not to mention that theres 50.000 fucking servers<br>
<br>
<br>
if anyone wants a 1on1 in cs 1.6, ill glady accept it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

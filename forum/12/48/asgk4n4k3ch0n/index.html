	<div class="content">Hi everyone! im kanaka, aka esteban , and im from Costa Rica, so sorry if my english is too bad  . We are a clan that play many games, but im part of the group playing HL2DM, i played it since the first day, but just for fun, and until some months ago i retook the game and began to practice, and now we are in the CAL 2v2 trying to play a good role (of course we are not that good but we try to give the best thing of us). We have a page with a section for the spanish-talking hl2dm comunity, trying to bring tutorials, videos, demos and many things more close to all the gamers there who are interested in hl2dm, and we are trying to make the game a bit more popular between the many fps out there. <br>
<br>
This is a great portal for the hl2dm players, and i hope i will can help you in anything you need. So well, i think thats all, maybe i will see you in some servers and maybe will play together. <br>

	<div class="content">Hey guys i finally made it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
I'm ninojman i began playing hl2dm after i beat hl2SP (1 week after it's release) <br>
<br>
Meet lots of friendly players in the beginning at The War Room and others, <br>
Someone came by one day and said their was a tourney for hl2dm (AAT) and i quickly started forming a team from the very friendly players/pubbers from the war room, with phoenix's help, I created wRw.  AAT died b4 it got started since many of their founders didn't like the game.  With a few talks with phoenix about AAT dying, (which wasn't a league b4 hand) he suggested we take the clans from AAT the still wanted to play and go talk to the ppl at STA.  Which trash, dezo, and I did, already having many teams wanting to play it wasn't hard to get in.  And with wRw just starting i let trash and dezo admin sta(lol big mistake)  about 40+ matches in STA - it was great fun while it lasted. Very tit nit group of clans and players.   I enjoyed ever match win or lose.  <br>
<br>
i play dods in cal for some odd reason, i can't stand the game or the community and i'm in my 5th season lol<br>
<br>
but w/e i'll be around <br>
<br>
<br>

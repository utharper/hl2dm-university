	<div class="content">Hello everyone, [GoTg] old time no.7 here, aka Andrew. <br>
<br>
Clan mate WT recommended the site and I must say Im very impressed with the approach to this great but often overlooked game.<br>
<br>
Due to the size of the player pool, I feel like this is a small enough community where in order to keep the game alive its necessary to help the new people to assimilate to the speed of this game. <br>
I would argue that most of the newer people playing come from other Steam games, most notably CS/CS:S. <br>
Its a change from CS enough that players may have a hard time adapting to the play (unless theyve played Quake/Unreal games).  <br>
I draw this conclusion based upon pub FFAs with people who dont know about the existence of the sprint button, or people who duck to spray the MP7.<br>
<br>
I play for the fun when my schedule allows and really would like to thank all of those whove had the patience to teach me this game to improve the over all quality of the FPS experience; from the CL/Rates tweaks to the more advanced movement techniques this game is a fun and addictive game.<br>
<br>
The maps I enjoy are the smaller faster maps on stock gravity. i.e. aim arena type maps. <br>
<br>
Thanks again.<br>

<br>
I really appreciate your insight on our players; I feel the same way.  There's so many scrubs like me out there, just waiting to be trained enough to be addicted <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
Nice to have you here, and I hope you can help us grow as well.  I'm 100% with you on the maps, we'll have to play sometime.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I am an old CS player (the name WT comes from when I first started CS actually) and OT#7 came from CS also, just not recently. Hopefully we can bring a few more over as this game needs the numbers and CS has plenty to share.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

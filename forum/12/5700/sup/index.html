	<div class="content">There's not that much to say about myself...but here's a short spiel.<br>
<br>
I'm just an average student who happens to be bored with life and enjoys FPS games as a way to pass the time when the weather happens to be too deplorable to skate outside.<br>
<br>
After putting CoD/ET/StarCraft on hiatus due to school and such, I decided to pick up HL2DM as a casual time killer. I'm not sure if I'm picking the wrong servers to play on or whatnot but it seems like most players on the pub servers I connect to are terrible. It seems like for the most part, pubs are filled with 14 year olds who rage in their mic and can't strafe or aim. Not to say that I play the game brilliantly but I seem to be decent. <br>
<br>
Anyway, see you around.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">welcome.  you picked one of the greatest FPS games of all time.  but since your games of choice seem to be way different then hl2dm, im somewaht shocked you bought it.  long story shortened, you missed the boat by about 8 months.  all the leagues have been shut down and comp players dont play much, if any, now.  the pub servers are a joke now.  low grav, high damage, role playing etc.  the game is much more than meets the eye, you would be shocked how different it is playing a pub player vs a top teer comp player.  anyway, if you're lookign for a fast paced game that still has a lot of ppl playing i would suggest QL.  or maybe even TF2.   <br>
<br>
with that said, if you are hard set on learning this game there are a few ppl that are still around that could give you some help.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I mean I'm fine with the settings on most of the servers I play on, there are some nice weapons as well. I've tried QL but it messes up my aim in other games so I try to stay away from it.

there used to be a very active community.  i mean hundreds of us every night.  we playd in CAL(not sure if you are familar with that or not) its an online gaming league.  there was also a league called warzone run by one of the 911 guys.  we had 5+ hardcore mappers pushing out new maps for us all the time.  mapping contests, tournaments, scrims, etc.  was really an amazing community to be a part of.  most ppl on here have been playing this game for many years, well over 5+.  the hl2dm division of CAL was shutdown for reasons that can be read about if you wanted.  that was the begining of the end for us.  there is an active euro league that still runs(atleast i think they still do) if you wanted to check that out called Clans United at <a href="http://www.clans-united.net" class="postlink">http://www.clans-united.net</a>  <br>
the only thing is you have to deal with the high ping and language barrier.  i believe they play with FF on too.  <br>
<br>
scrims were run all the time.  we all knew each other really well so who ever was online would usually get a match going.  there was a lot of clans so the matches were almost always clan based.  the clan that i am affiliated with is Evil Empire or EE you can check out our forum if you want, there is a link in my sig.  there is also a clan called Freedom Fighters that has a lot of members that still play.  they are NOT comp. based and they have pub servers (very well run) for DM play.  they do run events from time to time as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not quite sure what you are referring to. If you're talking about the 2v2 tournament last summer, at that time I was not a part eFPS or anything that went down, but I will assure you that wont happen again.<br>

I know we (Senior Slayers) aren't a competitive clan, but running these scrims instills a lot of fun and sportsmanship throughout the community. I'd definitely say swing by and give us a shout enjoi if you like, we're always looking for some cool people to chill and frag with.

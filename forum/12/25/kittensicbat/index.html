	<div class="content">Hi there.  I'm Icbat, leader/manager/scheduler/etc. for OMG Kittens.  I've been playing HL2 for a little over a year; this is my first season playing competitively.  I've managed a CSS CAL-O team before, which 3/4 Kittens members played on.  We all go way back (minus Screenpeaker, who we've only recently had the pleasure of meeting).  In the past, I've worked as staff for Stratics.com for several different MMO's, beta-tested different games from different genre's, and of course, played games as much as possible.<br>
<br>
I'm very excited to be a part of the fairly new CAL league for HL2, and to be a part of this community.  Everyone has seemed very nice, and I cant' wait to grow and to do my best to help others grow as well.<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Sup, I am stretch from Hell's Elite (did not know any other HE players really took a look at this place), but yea. I am starting to look into mapping sorta. Not to good at it, but am learning. I have started a new one, but just have not had time to finish it up (also would like help on weapon placement and lighting, I just want to make it a good map). Also looking into doing a frag video. Wanting to get better, or better than I am now so if any top notch players in the hl2dm community would be willing to 1v1 a decent (not great) player contact me on Xfire - mile14<br>
Thx<br>

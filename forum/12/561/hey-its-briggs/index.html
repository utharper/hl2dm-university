Yes, that is my first map, but a hl2dm player named JF style has compleatly stole my idea and has taken almost full credit, he re-made my map with the same style and texturs. becasue I am new to hammer, he did a way better job and releaced it befor my map got out of the beta stage.<br>
<br>
Altho my map is much more of a chaleng, hehe</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">I wouldn't say using the crate textures was exactly an original idea.  And from what was in your video, the only concept he really copied was the double bar bunny hopping part. So what it looks like is that he saw the map you were working on, liked the idea, and decided to make one of his own version. Theres nothing wrong with that, that's about 99% of the maps out there.<br>
<br>
BTW I think it's fishy that after multiple requests you still haven't posted a link to download YOUR map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have the unfinished version of the map (asked him for it and he sent me it no problem) so it does exist , nothing fishy about it. <br>
He'll post it up eventual but all he's saying is that he doesn't want to share it with the rest of the world until it's fully finished...simple, nothing wrong with that! so have a little patience and respect the man's wishes. GAWD :roll:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I will put my map shown in the video and my other one ( no one has seen it yet ) on file front as soon as possible people!!!<br>
<br>
and btw JF-styles was one of the first people to play on my map, he never mentioned anything about his map, or that he was making anything simmiler, then a few weeks later after having my map,  he all the suden has a map that is very similier.... I have no PROOF that he copied my map but I came up with the texture set and the all the movement testing on my own, and now there just happends to be a map that came out by a guy who tested my map a few weeks before and even used the same texturs and puzzles... thats all I have to say about that.<br>
<br>
that movement map was my first one and I feel very dicuraged after I work on it so long and then styles creats a map with the exact same ideas. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just wanted to drop in and introduce myself.  I'm just your average pubber who is trying to get a little better at the game.  HL2DM is really the only PC game I'm playing right now but I don't get to play it as much as I'd like.  (My wife is yelling at me to get off the computer and come to bed as I type this!)  To give you an idea of where I'm at, here's a demo from tonight of me trying to learn how to strafe jump:<br>
<br>

<br>
It's so funny, on most of the failed jumps I  feel like I've got the distance but I wind up hitting the bar between the windows. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">  I also feel like I'm doing it a little differently from the way it's described in the tutorial here.  I think I hit crouch before I actually hit jump... it may be only be a split-second earlier but if I try to make myself hit both at the same time I never get the distance.  I dunno.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not sure what you guys want to know about me personally.  I'm married with no kids, about to turn 40, work in IT and IRL I play Magic the Gathering semi-competitively.  I've won a little money at the game over the years but not enough to pay for all the cards I've bought.<br>
<br>
Well, that's about it!  Hope to meet some of you guys online one day.  I mostly play on the TSGK servers right now, XXV in particular.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

And you're not supposed to hit crouch even at the same time as jump. Personally I hit it right after jump which has taken me to 10 on ptrain so far, but I've been told that it could even be better to hit crouch only when you've reached the highest part of the jump.<br>
<br>
I watched your demo and your jump looks fine. However, you'll make it over more consistently if you jump as close as possible to the pillar on your left (if you look at the charger), making the jump as short as possible.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's just the kind of advice that I need.  Thanks a million!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

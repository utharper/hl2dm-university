	<div class="content">Hi all!!<br>
<br>
I meant to get registered to this site a while back but didn't get around to it until now.  It's great to see a site available specifically supporting DM!!  I won't bore you with any personal information so I will enlighten your spirits with how I got into HL2DM.  I've always been a gamer, mainly on consoles (please be gentle) and I had played HL1 on the Playstation but didn't enjoy it all that much - I hate FPS's using a controller, I just can't get the hang of it.  So I was a bit uneducated about HL until one day I was watching an episode of X-Play on G4TV and they had a review of HL2!!  That was all it took, the sheer beauty of the graphics, gameplay, you name it, this game had it.  I purchased it and played through it a couple of times and fell in love.  Not too long after I finally got hooked up with an ISP that had some speed to it and it was then I "attempted" deathmatch.  Wow, I was a bit nervous as it was somewhat new to me.  I believe the first map I ever played was lockdown, I was running around and suddenly encountered my first opponent - within a matter of a few seconds *POW*.  I was dead!!  About 35 deaths later and no kills of my own I called it quits for the day.  As time went on I got better and now can keep up with some of the good players but there's always room for improvement in my gameplay.  I have been running a DM server for some time now and am always trying to improve it in some way!!<br>
<br>
So there ya have it - my online names are dbanimal, fastmax1 and fastmax06 (I have 3 computers loaded with DM - no, I'm not rich).  Maybe I'll see some of you online sometime!! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

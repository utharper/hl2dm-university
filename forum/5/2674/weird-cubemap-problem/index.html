	<div class="content">I've surfed all the Internet for this question but nowhere is an exact andswer. I've been working on lockdown2 revision cause it has good potential but made by and "ass-hander". All the leaks made by developers were fixed, but there's still a bug that the world shot in cubemaps is lit with only the skylight like there are no artificial lightsources though the ones are working as expected in the real image. I've already had the same problem in a small test killbox map and fixed it by a miracle, unfortunately the same methods didn't work for lock2. I've tried lots of actions so now only need to know the obvious reason from experienced mappers. Please, help.<br>

Of course after test-compiling the map I've set sv_cheats 1 and buildcubemaps, reloaded the map - all by documentation, but the cubemaps were like on screenshots attached: no lamps, only sunlight on the surfaces cast light.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

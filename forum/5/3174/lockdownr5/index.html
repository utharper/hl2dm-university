They were supposed to stop or slow down speed ducking the vent, and from what I have seen if they do slow it down its only by .05 seconds. So mostly they do nothing but serve as something to get stuck on when your ping exceeds 60 ish, might as well have left the wonderfull fan that sucked you up in there as this really isnt any better.<br>
<br>
It just kills me that a viable solution to prevent speed ducking is not being implemented over a freaking stupid ass low percentage xbow bank.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dont think your xbow, ar2w orbs, shotgun, and smg nades are gonna stand up too well against 2 or more players coming back in the bathrooms with rpgs, 100/200, mags, shotguns, xbows, 3x smg nades. <br>
IMO a xbow wouldnt change much, the extra AR2 is useless would rather have had the shotgun instead.<br>
<br>
The vent is easy and I have already said it a million times, you leave the vent as it was originally, you put a button inside the fan room which must be pushed and then it either drops the rpg or opens a door for it to be grabbed. This can be done and timed to be the exact same as the amount of time that it takes to normal speed crawl in and out. SO in a sense you let people speed crawl in and out but they must sit inside and wait for the rpg for a few seconds, so that it is the same. By doing this you totally take out any advantage gained by speed crawling. If you think it cant be done go check out losthope and see how the rpg is done on that map, then ask valar for help if you cant figure it out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This has also been suggested and done by Dallas in a revision he did, I feel it is a possible solution as well however it disrupts a low percentage xbow bank that some people feel is game breaking if they cant do it (which is a joke since in 3 seasons of CAL play I have never seen a kill scored by it in a competitive match) It is also said that some people can still do it anyway with the vent raised but I haven't seen it, so as far as Im concerned if it is possible it is very hard to do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">FYI everybody - all items in DM may show / have problems spawning IF there are errors in the map. problem is these are errors that CANNOT be traced since they result from a <strong class="text-strong">bug in the actual code</strong> that has little or no relation to mapping. something in the map's position on the grid (but not always) / structure (but not always)/ entities (but not always) is triggering it. this is not necessarily something the mapper did but rather Valve neglected to notice / later address.<br>
This is a <strong class="text-strong">random problem</strong> in the sense it <strong class="text-strong">cannot be foreseen</strong> while production of the map. This by the way rules out the myth about this problem occurring only when the map is on the dead center of the grid - believe you me - i have made literally hunderds of maps in dead center and none showed this problem while others which were in no way in the center of the grid, did.<br>
And therefore; most probably the AR2 wouldn't have spawned correctly even if it was a second AR2 right next to the original one.<br>
You won't be surprised to learn this error <strong class="text-strong">does not happen in all OB games</strong>.<br>

	<div class="content">i'm curious how many beta testers u had lol<br>
why are so many looong jumps in this, if i want to learn to jump longer, i go play ptrain.. and some skate/bhop levels are so linear, so straight, they leave very little room for lefty righty, require a freakin long initial jump (who told u that a.. 11+ ptrain jump is a must for a good skate when even 8 is enough?) and so it's easy to under/over do em imo; as for last level.. u block the visibility of entire path WTF that's a bad way to try to add replayability to a level <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">)<br>
i'd comment on MANY levels but by the name of it it's ur final version?<br>
well ima comment on mapping, just a bit:
<ul>
<li>-textures? the main one is over used and bit annoying here as I can't tell how big is the ledge im standing on <img src="http://oi53.tinypic.com/2r61ve1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
-sound of water is played when i touch floor from noclip wth and it gets really old really fast (specially since I'm teleported often and fast by floor AND pillars and what not.. I miss falling juuust an inch), use some subtle environmental sounds/music also or nothing at all, not even water. so. tired. of. water.<br>
-overall blunt, boring, repetitive and doesn't give sense of speed and distance</li>
</ul>
sry if i sound harsh, maybe it's the frustrating jumps to blame. i don't see this in a map rotation any time soon without some serious testing, feedback and appropriate changes<br>

q: why didn't u enter the cu mapping competition?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Just me. But some people are already beat the final version. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzY1ZMpTlgI" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzY1ZMpTlgI</a>)<br>

Long jump require regularity and is that who made the difficulty. How can you have a good strafe with easy jump?<br>
I'm aware my map is far from perfect.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>i'd comment on MANY levels but by the name of it it's ur final version? </div></blockquote>

If i can improve the map, i'll do it. So no.<br>

Your pictures doesn't work.<br>

You aren't the only one to tell me that, i think i delete it. ^^<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>-overall blunt, boring, repetitive and doesn't give sense of speed and distance</div></blockquote>

It's on purpose to give some difficulty.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>[/list]<br>

It's your opinion, critics are always good to take. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>q: why didn't u enter the cu mapping competition?</div></blockquote>

Because i wasn't aware of it, a friend warned me too late, just made the map for the fun.<br>

<br>
Inspired by this thread by ibscotty:<br>
<br>

<br>
Lets use this thread to develop the concept. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Note: nothing written in stone, just ideas at this point.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Rules</strong><br>
<br>
* Map must be previously unreleased and completed to prefinal level.<br>
* Mapper must submit .vmf and .bsp for technical and play review.<br>
* Deadline 3 mths or so?<br>
* Contest is open to all mappers. Any HL2DMU Official wanting to participate<br>
must opt out of all judging responsibilities. Official may be permitted to judge if their map is no longer in contention.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Prizes</strong><br>
<br>
* $100.00 minimum, plus anything else we can raise prior to the deadline.<br>
* Top 3 mappers will have the opportunity to work with HL2DMU Officials to tweak and finetune their maps on a technical and gameplay level through extensive testing and bug checking. Upon completion to final level, all three maps  will be included in a special community map pack, similar to DOD:S CAMP pack.<br>
* Winning map will run on as many servers as we can get to support the contest. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Judges</strong> <br>
<br>
* HL2DMU Officials for finalists (final 8 maybe?).<br>
* HL2DMU Board Members for winner and runner up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So far the ideas are sounding great. You know damn well im participating in this!<br>
However if I do create a map, I would also like to judge the other maps and opt myself out from voting for myself of course. The least I could do is beta test them for bugs and clipping. Anyways, 3 months sounds like a plentiful amount of time to graph out a map on paper, ensure the layout, and then begin building. We should also make an effort to let people know that the map should be based on balance and a damn good layout rather than just eye candy. 'Cause you know people are gonna be making these ridiculous looking levels with crappy layouts.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
And if all goes well with this competition, we should do it every 3 months! It'll keep people involved and get our leagues some new maps to choose from!<br>
<br>
Also: I believe there should be a set size in which to build the map in, or at least set some kind of rule as to how many players the map should be able to support.<br>
I believe that if a map can support a 1v1, 2v2 and hold at least 12-16 players then its pretty worthy. But of course, most importantly, the map should have a good layout. Mappers should also aim for some sort of new gameplay style. Something different, not just lockdown w/ a different layout</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's too small even for 1v1s in my opinion, the RPG is too easy to get, and the main strategy in there is just to use the jump pads to get the RPG as quick as possible.

For example, one room may have the 200 charger while on the opposite side, there are orbs or an RPG, making it more even and less lop-sided if one guy dies and the other decides to camp one of these rooms.

I wasn't talking about size limit, just to care about size... I mean, we could make a WONDERFUL map but the file size is about 200MB and well... that would hurt on the overall score.<br>

You can use team spawns (info_player_combine and info_player_rebel) if you really want to, but it is not recommended.<br>
<br>
Foremost, unless you make a perfectly symmetrical map (can be boring) there will always be opinions about which side is given the advantage. By using info_player_deathmatch and keeping spawns random, this is a non-issue. Most competitive maps that see a lot of play dont use team spawns (bio, lock, zeta, backbone, avalon_b1 etc.)<br>
<br>
Balance does not refer to symmetry necessarily. Try not to limit yourself to that. Balanced means for example, not having a single point that once one team gets hold of it is impossible for the other team to take back. Even zeta, which has rpg, ar2 and supercharger inside has several ways you can come in to try to take it back. Forcing one team to assault an easily defendable choke is generally bad.<br>
<br>
An extreme example of unbalanced would be a tower with a view of the entire map and little path leading up to it and inside is a supercharger, mag and rpg. Like nino said, it is also about laying out weapons in a thoughtful manner. We will do a weapon review with the winners though, so dont worry to much about how balanced they are in the prefinal version you submit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

agreed.</div></blockquote>

That's why when I 1v1 on aim, I ask for no rpg.</div></blockquote>but orbs are kool right? hahaha</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As long as it is well textured and every section of the map doesn't look the same, so you know where you are at all times, you should be fine. It can be a HL2/official map style theme, or it can be completely unique, as long as it plays well (avalon and spookface come to mind for unique themes).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I totally agree with you, that map is full of spam, not much actual "aim" is required if you playing with a guy who solely depends on suit and smg nades.<br>
<br>
The new reloaded version has got tight textures, but it would be nice if they took a few suits out, that rpg, and a few nades will be nice.<br>
<br>
The current version is good for pubic servers, not so good for a 1v1, but it is fun to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is generally where item control comes in, if you're losing to pure spam that means you're doing a terrible job at item control. Aim_Arena wasn't even built with 1on1s or anything in mind, but the rpg is there as a balancer to the mag camper. If you take out *anything* non-mag wise that just strengthens the magnum and then the map is pretty much "hey, lets test out whoever has the best aim, who cares about item control and strategy!" (although that's what it is close to, however the player who can manage his resources better will win)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
<br>
This is <strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_milieu</span> </strong>.<br>
A long collaboration with many people however mainly Fearsome and mLIQUID did the most here. Fearsome, thanks for your valuable input and suggestions especially in the weapon placement dept. and those two zigzag connections - very much appreciated!! mLIQUID, your help here was priceless.<br>
it was a lot of fun finding so much help and cooperation in the community. <strong class="text-strong">we can have nice things</strong>.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
This map is an attempt to bring in a high level movement, long jumps and fast layout in an eye candy enviroment whilst keeping performance decent.<br>
The most part of this map uses custom texstures and models taken from various Source mods mostly CS:S, Pirates Vikings and Knights and a beautiful mod called Eclipse that's long discontinued.<br>
<br>
a bit more ss this time as i wanted to show a bit more of the layout. <br>

Minor nuance (not even a complaint from my pov):<br>
And I know the rung is gone, but: The only thing you will hear is that the ladder from the rpg out of the water you have to jump out of the water (which doesn't always work) or hit your use key. I normally hit my use key to climb anyhow (especially mid jump). Alot of players will expect to simply look up and mount the ladder, which I didn't find possible. I did bounce out of the water and make it once, although it is inconsistent, and it will seem counter-intuitive to any newer players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">on the ladder - my argument is that pressing Use for ladder is a generic function. i for one have always used it to get on  ladders. i use to get on and use to get off.<br>
the reason it doesn't work is because water level is not "ground" for it to be considered as "ground level" by the engine. the Use command however - works. that is btw the reason getting on ladders in HL2 can be done in two ways - "automatic" and "function".<br>

on weapon placement - that goes for Fearsome solely.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sure you want to release a v2 so soon?<br>
<br>
The bugs are very minor, and more little things you may notice may crop up over the course of a week or so. <br>
<br>
I think you should give it a week or so, then you can be sure you haven't missed anything.<br>
<br>

While I’m at it also addressed some minor texture relateds and added a small wood sign for creds. <br>

	<div class="content">Your best work yet, for sure. Solid layout, just the right amount of props, looks beautiful. Overall this looks like itll be great for 1v1 and 2v2 both.<br>
<br>
And that said, criticisms / bug findings:<br>
<br>
- Orbs and nades that hit the pond floor just vanish. This could be a purposeful remove trigger or just a broken virtual mesh, not sure, but its very counter intuitive and makes catching someone down there that much harder.<br>
<br>
- Another route out of the pond might be nice for flow purposes, and to prevent catching the rpg player from being an automatic response to exactly the same area every time. Perhaps a second ladder, or a slow/winding stair opposite the original ladder.<br>
<br>
- Two ARs is likely to end up as overkill on a map where the majority of the play is in enclosed or semi-enclosed corridor-shaped areas, especially once players figure out all the best orb banks.<br>
<br>
- Rather minor nit, but the lighting, while excellent in its ambience, does make for difficult player id at times (reminds me of dm_drift in that way). You could use color correction to achieve the same level of eye candy while allowing players to turn it off and have more visibility for league matches, though the level of additional effort that might take probably isnt worth it.<br>
<br>
- Lastly, there are still several camp spots (the type that see nodraw and can be overly strong in play) on the _r1 version i tested, as well as a couple spots where movement felt a bit buggy or constrained. Nothing that couldnt be easily and quickly fixed with a touch of player clip here and there though.<br>
<br>
Cool that you used bits from Eclipse, too. Amazing anyone still remembers that mod.<br>

This is known issue and one I thought would be an interesting feature; calculating your nades to go off before they hit the bottom. Moreover, moving through water is pretty slow and the player can’t really do much against someone standing atop trying to take them down. That being said, further playtests will certainly reveal whether or not this should be changed. Note that they are removed only few inches from the bottom. You have the whole of the water volume untouched.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Another route out of the pond might be nice for flow purposes, and to prevent catching the rpg player from being an automatic response to exactly the same area every time. Perhaps a second ladder, or a slow/winding stair opposite the original ladder.</div></blockquote>

We need to see more input from people playing the map to make a call on that. I personally love the idea of the RPG being so damn hard to get. I would daresay this will vary when the map is played in teams (when you have a backup) and when in 1v1 (when you’re alone). <br>
If we think about it a bit more we see that the whole RPG area now makes for very interesting situations and adds a lot to the map overall gameplay.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Two ARs is likely to end up as overkill on a map where the majority of the play is in enclosed or semi-enclosed corridor-shaped areas, especially once players figure out all the best orb banks.</div></blockquote>

I’m indifferent about this. I think fearsome best answer this one.<br>

I am reading about color correction now and will most definitely experiment with it (I can’t thank you enough for bringing this up). However must say I’m not sure I see how or where the current lighting makes it hard to id a player. It would be super if you could give ss or name locations you’re referring to. Or, PM me and we can go through the map together.<br>

You’ve tested r1. r2 had a few of those fixed. Again, ss or naming actual locations would help tracking the misbehaving nodraws  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

	<div class="content">It plays exceptionally well. <br>
<br>
Not sure about there being too much armor. Although I am jaded because the shotgun is so overpowered on my server that the amount of armor is the only thing to save you from being constantly one shotted by it. <br>
<br>
I'm not a fan of there being more than 1 orb by the ar2 pickup near the charger. 99% of the time it equates to an immediate spam of orbs. And while I'm a huge fan of orbs (I love orb battles and have had many good 1v1s with [~$W~]TLC where that is a dominating factor hehe). I think they could use a bit of space between each other. But this is mainly because there are two ar2s with orbs directly at the same pickup area. I think it might be more suitable if only one of the ar2s had an orb directly at it and have the other orbs spread through the map more. <br>
<br>
The RPG is useless to go for in larger pubs. Your gonna get owned by anybody with a decent shot that sees you go down. In smaller pubs tho (3-4) it can be fun to go for and quite tense to get away with. And I'm sure in TDM it plays into the team work of guarding that area well. So I really like how that was done. (I'm not always a huge fan of the RPG in pubbing, but you can't really live without it in competition). <br>
<br>
I would have liked to see more physics props overall. There is a lack of ggun battles which is a defining factor of HL2dm play. I'm not talking lockdown number phsics props though, but the map does feel void of them, much like lostvillage does. It's fun to have physics of different sizes as well, instead of the same size barrel everywhere. So for ggun battles the map is dull. It's a stark contrast from being able to select from radiators, fences, small cabinets, computers, etc. And with the current them of milieu you could have come up with some more interesting objects to fit in. <br>
<br>
There are a solid amount of paths to take, to pop in and out, surprise others, flank them, etc. It's easy to get to where you want to and when you want to. It never feels like a chore to get anywhere. <br>
<br>
Very nice map overall.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Total of 10 physics_props and total of 10 physics_props_respawnable. 16 of which are all the same size and realistically if you need to go for the respawnable ones your dead meat. The little plants, mostly because if their size, do nothing more than bounce of your opponent most of the time. So that leaves 6 <strong class="text-strong">reliable</strong> physics props that you would actually <strong class="text-strong">want</strong> to use.  And again, the main argument is that all the <strong class="text-strong">useable</strong> ones are the same size. Makes for little variety. So yes, the map is dull in regards to gravity gun play. <br>
<br>
I also never commented on the overall amount of orbs in the map. I said its due to them being at the same location as the ar2 themselves. A common mapping practice is to put ammo for weapons not at the same location, but scattered throughout the map so as to encourage movement and playability. I think this is especially true when you place two ar2s in the map, both of which have secondary ammo at their exact location. What I said was that when people pick up the ar2 and the 2 orbs, or the 1 ar2 with the 1 orb, it leads to an immediate spam (use*) of the orbs. It makes things too predictable in given situations. <br>
<br>
*My definition of spam was not centered on the common derogatory manner in which people tend to relate that the feel there is too much spam. If anything I wouldnt mind seeing a fourth orb on the map. I like orbs, for much the same reason I like more physics props (that are good) on the map, it leads to battles centering on the gravity gun and switching between weapons - which again is one of the main draws of HL2. But if they were not located at the same location as the ar2 themselves it would lead to less predictable play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its on my current server rotation, played it with 1 to 12 other people everyday a few times since r2 has been released. My comments are specified in different sections depending on context. I.E. as in the RPG, would be good in TDM, rather useless in larger pub play. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Two sizes between the props does not constitute a variety in size.</strong> There is a definite lack of physics props that are usefull. There is a definite lack of variety of physics props sizes. The lack of phsyics props is only compounded by the fact that the little plants and respawnable props are not as <strong class="text-strong">useful</strong> as you are making them out to be. None of the props_respawnable will stand a match against a shotgun, a crossbow, an ar2, the smg nades, the regular nades etc. This makes them all but useless. In contrast, in a map like lockdown the props come in every size from tiny, small, medium, large, and huge (especially that fence). The vast majority of which are actually useful, keyboard and chairs notwithstanding. <br>
<br>
The map is obviously not geared towards gravity gun play. <br>
<br>
In regards to the orbs, it never fails. Someone picks the ar2 and orbs up, they use the orbs right after. Every time. Its too predictable. Spacing the orbs out would simply make people have to work a little bit more for them, and make the map play less predictable. It's not rocket science or brain surgery.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

of course, i also accidentally enabled vsync at the same time (hit the wrong drop down while switching back and forth between color correction for comparison).  and i played for quite awhile last night wondering why everything seemed so effed up.  my fps ws locked at 75 and i was like, wtFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF???   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

props can't really get stuck under it because there is a trigger_push where the lift is. <br>
so in both cases - if it still gets perm stuck then this is a game bug and not map side = nothing i can do about it.<br>
i can replace the lift with a small jumpad - if this is indeed a show stopper.<br>

	<div class="content">Having played a few rounds on the map now, i have a couple criticisms:<br>
<br>
- Health and armor. Specifically, way too much of both. Its almost impossible to do half a circuit of the map and not be at 100/100, even if you were at 25/0 before you started the circuit. Excessive armor in particular puts a strong bias on instant kill / explosive weapons as well, something that doesnt mix well with 2x ar and numerous smgnades. One less ar and 1-2 less smgnades would probably balance the aim/spam play out a bit more too.<br>
<br>
- RPG. Lack of gravgun response is counterintuitive and pretty unnecessary, especially considering what a deathtrap that pond is. A second exit of some sort would be nice as well to reduce the linearity of movement that area.<br>
<br>
- Barrels. Its not readily obvious which are indestructible and which arent in combat or at lower dx levels; both skins having the same flags would be an improvement here.<br>
<br>
I also recall the pond floor eating nades/orbs etc in a previous beta, but didnt end up putting that to the test in my recent games there, so cant comment further yet. Thats it for now.<br>
<br>
Edit: Almost forgot: The lifts can be prevented from getting stuck by setting a damage value (any number will work, though trapped destructible props have to be destroyed before the lift can unstick itself, so a min of 0.25 is recommended) and checking the Force Closed flag. This also assumes your lift is a func_door; if its func_movelinear youre probably best swapping it over for access to the extra flags and keyvalues.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

proly the most important input - changes will be made in this department. Thanks.<br>

in next version i will remove the physclip from the RPG. but i won't make another route. the linearity of that area is super important to how this map runs and proved successful times and times again.<br>

i agree.<br>

Fixed a few versions ago. it only teleports props back to the map. to the marker (center) area to be exact.<br>

lifts and the like are broken in hl2dm for a good while now mate. none of these tricks work; i tried them all long time ago. i'm afraid a different solution is called for here. will be corrected in next version.<br>

Glad to see the criticisms are of use.<br>
<br>
Also, have a look at the lifts in dm_killbox_ultra; nothing can make them flip out or get stuck. They do take a few seconds to kill players or destroy the nitrous canisters (300 health) present in that map, but anything non-destructible (props, weapons etc) just gets ignored.<br>
<br>
This assumes something hasnt changed since that map was made, but iirc dm hasnt had an update since then... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The one you added to the rpg area really helps that area out, but the others are bad imo.

Turbo ladders are an interesting change to the game in general. I am used to waiting for someone to attach to a ladder before making my shot, and it changes the prediction as they reach the top. On the other hand it reduces deaths from bad attachments.<br>

I tend to think they improve the game,  but they do take some getting used to.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I personally love turbo ladders and think they give much better gameplay but the majority has spoken and milieu goes back to hl ladders.<br>
i've replaced the wep lights with spinning sprites (no light)<br>
in the RPG case turbo or no this area became such a debate and a major pain in the ass with so many ppl that it had to undergo a drastic change. the answer comes in the form of a lift.<br>
At the base of the lift you will see a map sign - firing your G-gun on it will set off the lift. end of story.<br>
<br>
i hope everyone or most will enjoy the new changes. i don't think i will be touching this map again unless some world ending bug comes along and destroys milieu OnMapSpawn lol. but seriously enough is enough.<br>

Brush ladder for the rpg area is great (adding a "mount" sound top and bottom is a good idea too) but the other small ladders dont benefit greatly from it- the lack of random attatchment during combat is nice, but they can be hard to climb when the player actually wants to use them.<br>

One thing I thought was negative in milieu before was the 3 + 2 armor up top at the mag/loft.

Wow. All you did was make a few revisions of a map that you didn't create, and then you went and started fully screwing with everything in the map unnecessarily, and now you're saying a great map made from scratch by Valar is no longer unique because he reduced the armor a bit to make gameplay more balanced, lol?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

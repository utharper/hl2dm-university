	<div class="content">Please help me out, I've googled my eyes out and I still don't know how to make this stuff. I just want to somehow create a small/medium object (brush, entity, I don't care), put a simple texture on it and in-game I want it to break and explode upon impact and why not, respawn! Bear in mind I'm a beginner at this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Be aware that brush-based physics entities lighting is set at compile time and does not change when moving them around like it does with models, and that models perform much better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, if you're doing it with a brush entity, I think it may be possible to respawn it with a point_template, with a timer controling it or something.<br>
If it works fine then it's ok. Mind what boshed said tho. It means the brush (entity) must be visible to lights on the compile time. Otherwise it will look like you forgot it on the grill 6 hours ago. Black.<br>

But how about models? How do we make them KABOOOM! ? (I've been talking about this with ade, I can't see any diference between the normal oildrum and the explosive oildrum.. 0o)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You can embed prop_data in the model using it's .qc - explosive oildrum has this set, see <span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Propdata#Exploding_props" class="postlink">here</a></span><br>
<br>
You'll notice how it's very similar to the properties available to a physics prop, but this as actually stored in the model.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well can you expand that 'etc'? I added some values like: Explosion damage=300, Explosion radius=200, Strength=100, in the Flags tab I ticked: Enable motion on physcannon grab and Physgun can always pick up (so I could carry the object around) then added a texture. Results: it's pickable, breakable but not exploding on impact ;(<br>
<br>
And another thing.. is my router acting weird, or is it steam/hammer? I keep timing out after like 30 seconds from my fkn LOCAL server.. On top of that, some UK guy joined and crowbared me all of a sudden, I was baffled.. I mean...

this makes your server available only for a lan (even if you don't have one set up) preventing ppl from joining, and prevents that stupid steam ticked time out stupidity.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

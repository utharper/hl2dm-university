	<div class="content">This is a map in which I attempted to merge killbox gameplay and 'normal' mapping design.  It has the look of a european town centre, in which I drew inspiration from the Latin Quarter in Paris.  The rooftops and chimney are an example of this.  The other aspect of this map is I included just gravguns, sticks and grenades, so no smgs!<br>

Thanks, Its about 6 months old now the original map, and this latest update is of Feb 2007.  Im working on my latest, but that is delayed, and after that my possible entry to the tdm contest might come  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
On your idea, tbh I havent noticed any trends in terms of crashes except that it does seem to happen more on killboxes, so maybe something in that.  And also when im using the gravgun + other keys.<br>
<br>
I think almost any idea is feasible, just needs the determination to create your idea, and any obstacles you come accross you can overcome im sure  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

thank you very much for posting this!<br>
<br>
I swear I was going crazy play testing my own maps and wondering why they were crashing (even though it was not my fault at all)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

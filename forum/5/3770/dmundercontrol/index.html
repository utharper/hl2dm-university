It's quite a fun layout. Visually I'm not keen on the funky steps, or the very squared rock walls. I do like the teleport though!<br>
<br>
Did get a couple of spots where fps was quite low but overall performed well.<br>
<br>
I'd say keep going <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

also, i thought the map was a bit too elaborate and not very fine tuned LAYOUT wise. <br>
another thing was clipping - there's isn't any or hardly in your map. stairs, trims, etc....help ppl run / jump / bhop through your map more easily by applying slipping EVERYWHERE.<br>
in addition, would strongly recommend doing some reading about blocking vis and hinting. map is not optimized and i should say CAN BE.<br>
the Idea, the atmosphere and the obvious love for the game are very clearly shown in this beautiful map. keep up the work and only get better.<br>
loved it.<br>

yeah, i layed a hand on optimization, but the build of the map is too complicated and too open to get a better effect.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">this map ranked 7th on my score card and was actually the last map on my last to be in the 50's or above total score.  i thought the overall balance of the map was off as well as the layout.  i did think it had nice connectivity and i thought the size was really nice for a 4v4.  i really liked the echo's of children playing that could be heard when near the play ground area.  i thought that was super creepy and really cool.   like ghosts of children that used to play there before a fallout occured or something.  as for the big center area,  i would of thought you would but an RPG there, on the bridge and maybe a charger.  give players some reason to sacrifice going into an open area of easy death.  there were a couple other areas that looked really cool too, but i kepted getting the sense that i hadnt explored all of that area, and kept wondering if you had meant for one to be able to get up there or not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">niec map, my initial thoughts where there are some odd layout twists, loved the teleport idea although i personally would do more in the detail to explain the teleports.<br>
ON looking at it from a mappers POV, i liked the variety of work going on here, some good ideas and styles imo, although i think you / it would benefit from sourcing some real life examples/references (a problem I have. i r lazy  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  ) <br>

I can offer more detailed advice if needed/wanted.. <br>

	<div class="content">hey Duke, i've neglected to mention your teleport will most definitely bug out ingame when people will contantly get stuck inside eachother when one teleports right after the other (dm_secs) . you HAVE to work out some way to move the teleported player away from the exit point. preferably trigger_push. watch this one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@chemicalburn<br>
yeah, i built everything as i meant it. so if you got up to the transformators, then youre good at jumping <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
@PigPopper<br>
Everything was made out of my head^^ dunno, im interested in the architecture of some buildungs and when i come around i look at buildings in detail and then memorize some parts. <br>
<br>
@valar<br>
yep, that was a problem when i built the map but i thought that a trigger push wouldnt be a good solution because its quite near the enter of the teleport. humm.....<br>
<br>

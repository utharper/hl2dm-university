	<div class="content">hi there guys..<br>
<br>
just finished a new map .. called dm_bk_multiDev_arena_rc2<br>
but get in trouble with packin custom content into the .BSP these days  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
no matter if i use Man-map-analyzer or Packrat<br>
everybody else will see black/pink checkered areas instead of textures/decals<br>
<br>
the strange thing is..  if i open the .BSP with GCF-scape<br>
and take a look at the files within..<br>
every custom content is already inside the .BSP<br>
<br>
so why the hell those black/pink terror appears??<br>
<br>
my question is..<br>
what do u guys use to pack ur stuff into the .BSP??<br>
and did somebody else have probs like this since the update to OB engine??<br>
<br>
the first version of this map was compiled before the update,<br>
and has the same files within.. but no black/pink at all<br>
so what the hack valve has changed.. <br>
that the new version of this map, compiled after the update won´t work??<br>
<br>
here some pics of how it should look like..<br>
i guess u can imagine the black/pink terror with 90% custom textures  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>
<br>
please help me.. i´m totally gettin mad on this s**t<br>
cause the map is ready.. and i just want to play  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"></div>

	<div class="content">hey there haymaker..<br>
<br>
umm... my directory structure looks different <br>
its not materials/mapname like u point it..<br>
<br>
in my materials/.. are way more folders.. see pics<br>
(was working fine all the time this way)<br>
<br>
only thing i can imagine, is about the packing programms itself..<br>
both (packrat n man-map-analyzer) <br>
auto-changes the path´s of the .vmt´s to capitalize letters<br>
but the original .vmt´s are lower case <br>
<br>
on the other hand, this was workin just fine before the update, <br>
cause the 1rst compiled/packed version of this map,<br>
had capitalized letter path´s on .vmt´s.. when using Man_map-analyzer to pack<br>
<br>
but,.. and this is confusing....<br>
on using packrat in the past, <br>
i needed to re-write every single .vmt path <br>
back to lower case..to avoid black/pink chaos<br>
<br>
strange isn´t it??<br>
<br>
so the only solution i could find till now on a CSS forum somewhere was..<br>
<br>
copy all custom content to a new location (can´t remember the path right now^^)<br>
then re-write all the path´s of my custom .vmt´s, to fit the new location of files (about600path´s)<br>
then re-texturing the whole map (about10.000clicks)<br>
+ compile and pack twice..<br>
<br>
but i guess this is f++kin too much work..  <br>
won´t do that  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
pic 1 structure in materials/ folder<br>
pic 2 structure of the .bsp in GCF-scape (all custom content is already packed inside the .bsp)<br>
<br>
so i´m open for any solution guys don´t hold back ur thoughts about this prob, please</div>

	<div class="content">Is it me or the file path and the BSP path are the same?<br>
I'm a bit sleepy...<br>
<br>
I was wondering when I first read the 1st post, if it wouldn't be incompatibilities from the textures to the engine. Like, for exemple, before the update, if you tried to use a TF2 material in hl2dm it wouldn't work. I never knew the exact reason why, but my solution was to export the texture with vtfedit, import the resulting tga again and replace the vtf. That would work for all (or at least most) of them.<br>
<br>
I never knew how it was the other way around, that is if you tried to use a hl2dm material in an OB game. But if, by any chance, you're still converting textures to vtf just like you've ever done before, I wonder if there isnt anything else that should be done to them.<br>
<br>
But this is just a thought. I didn't analize the paths theory in whole. I'm too sleepy for that.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

another thing.. tsf sadist pointed out.. <br>

the simple answer is pakrat and man are not updated to cope with the new OB engine and the way it organises its files.  I would suggest visiting pakrat and man websites to see if they have updated their software to support OB.  If not maybe there is another software programe that packs bsps using OB? </div></blockquote>

true..<br>
also had something like this in mind..<br>
already visited the sites to have a look for updates..<br>
.. no success at all<br>
<br>
@sakruts the idea isn´t bad, but also a lot of work.. hope i can avoid this<br>

	<div class="content">Pakrat and others are not compatible with the new engine; I thought that goes without saying.<br>
Prior to the OB port HL2DM couldn't use TF2, L4D1,2 and EP2 materials since these games are siting on newer engine versions and are using higher VTF versions along the fact these games make use of shader types and shader functionalities which are not available for EP1 engine, where HL2DM used to sit before the port. Now it does.<br>
<br>
Here's one i've got today from a reply to my post on Interlopers'. Try it out (i will too in a few days hopefully). It's called PackBSP and is fully supported. Pakrat's developer seems to have abandoned his app a while back.<br>

<br>
here the latest news..<br>
<br>
after some first failed trys.. <br>
along with different error messages by using packbsp... <br>
idk exactly why..<br>
(but seems to be important that all updates of games are finished,<br>
and sdk content is refreshed aswell)<br>
<br>
the map was compiled twice.<br>
and i finally was able to successfully pack the bsp with my custom stuff.<br>
<br>
but at the moment its too early for HOOORAY screamings, <br>
gettin rid of my clothes and jump around naked to celebrate that possible success..lol<br>
cause first i need to find someone, who dl the map and test it the other end.<br>
normally my man cyrus will do that, but he is busy right now..<br>
rl is just more important than my map..<br>
<br>
but i´ll keep u updated if it will work, <br>
and then upload the map in a new thread soon.<br>
<br>
have to say thx for sharing ur thoughts so far..<br>
bet without ur guys view from distance on this prob<br>
i wouldn´t be able to fix that on my own anyways<br>
<br>
@ val, <br>
man.. if this tool u find will work..<br>
u maybe saved my life under mapping aspects twice  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

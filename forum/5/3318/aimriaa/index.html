	<div class="content">This is the first map I have ever released, but I have randomly done some brushwork and stuff in hammer before. Anyway, it is quite small considering how much ground there is to walk on. The map basically consists of two big rooms. One, the main room, that is surrounded by another room.<br>

Smaller part of the surrounding room. This is located above the main room.<br>

What do you think?<br>

	<div class="content">did a quick run thru. couple of things hit me right off the bat.<br>
<br>
1-lifts have no sound.<br>
<br>
2-there is A LOT of empty space.  in the surrounding room like 70% is just empty space nobody can get to or ever utilize.<br>
<br>
3-i like the "super lift" that shoots you across the room and the colors of the map<br>
<br>
4-why the 2 humps in the bottom of the main room?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">1. I don't really care, but I guess I could add sounds.<br>
<br>
2. I know there's a lot of space empty, but if you use the pads you can use all the space. My first thought about the big room with all the space was that people should be able to maximize their airtime. <br>
<br>
3. :^) <br>
<br>
4. The main reason why I made those humps was that I needed something that should enable players to get up to the half circles with ammo, etc. When I started adding the pads I realised that they wouldn't be used, but I thought they would add something to gameplay, because you can do some pretty high jumps using them by strafing straight into the slopes. Anyway, I see that they could be annoying in combat, and I'm now thinking about removing one and replacing the other.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's kinda disrespectful towards people that do "care". Not that I think you meant it that way, but in case you're wondering: That's how it comes across.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, that's true. I guess I shouldn't have said "IDC" in the very start of the post. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> Now I just want to point out that I really do care about my map, but I just don't really care about elevator sounds. <br>
<br>
@ badinfluence<br>
<br>
I am considering a new version now that I see that the map isn't completely forgotten, and I am going to place the RPG somewhere else (and better hopefully. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">) in that version</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've been wondering how to make this, you know that back and forth spring doors like in old western saloons. <br>
I know entities like phys_ballsocket, phys_hinge, phys_constraint, etc, but is it possible with any one of those alone?<br>
Or is it possible at all?<br>
<br>
well, I can make them simple func_door_rotating with "touch opens", to both directions, and it works kinda like that when the player bumps into them, but it looks mechanic.<br>
I was thinking something more realistic looking.<br>
<br>
Anyone knows this?<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok I tried one thing:<br>
<br>
I made:<br>
- two physboxes for the doors<br>
- a phys_hinge on the top corner of each door<br>
- two phys_springs to constrain each (1st entity) door separately <br>
- an info_target that will be the connecting point (2nd entity) for each spring<br>
<br>
The info_target is just a point to connect the springs as opposed to having one spring connecting both doors, which would make them non-stop. This way the mid point is fixed and each door moves independently and doesn't affect the other.<br>
<br>
This works, but... after messing around with damping and stuff, I could make the doors not be too hard to go through, but even as is, it's dificult to push them open.<br>
One must press forward and keep pushing for a few moments until the doors open enough. Physboxes have this problem... they are buggy with player bump.<br>
<br>
Any better ideas?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">That's a good thought but, I had seen it before (just double cheked now) they have the doors always open and static. Just brushwork for the looks. Actually most doorways in their maps don't even have doors. At least in the stock maps that I have played in. Dunno about custom ones. <br>
(Man I dunno how anyone can play with that gameplay...)<br>

chEmicalbuRn, that map (coop_elpaso) was one of the ones I double-checked and probably the only one with these doors. But the doors are only closed in the pictures before match starts. During the match they are open and are only static geometry. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"><br>

Maybe I'll stick with the simple rotating doors...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was pretty sure I remembered those doors being able to swing open when walked into, but if you checked I'll take your word for it.  Maybe they changed it since an older version</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It would take about 15 seconds to make doors like that in Garry's Mod, it's too bad Hammer is so difficult</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Then perhaps add a trigger around the model to trigger the animation just before the player touches it. <br>

Hmm, I gotta do some testing to that... I suck at animating models (as yet) but this may be just the solution to it...<br>

	<div class="content">yes, but that's what I already tried and mentioned in the 2nd post. It's hazardous. You always loose health for having a phys object coliding with you, and if it comes with greater speed it can even kill you. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>

The best chance is perhaps making a real model to use as a prop_physics or prop_dynamic. I know there's ways of triggering animations, I just gotta find out how.<br>
Or maybe the model can rely on physics too for sliding back and forth, but I dunno if that can cause loosing health too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

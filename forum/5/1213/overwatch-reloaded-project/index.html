<br>
<em class="text-italics"><strong class="text-strong">During my work on the map it would be great to get ppl's view on various aspects relating to the map… both current questions are performance related:</strong></em><br>
<br>
1. <span style="color:#000080">How important in your opinion are the opened (broken really) windows on the (2nd) floor under the RPG.</span> <span style="color:#004080">Alternative – close those windows altogether.</span>(Remember - you can ONLY throw nades from the outside. you CANNOT do anything effective from the inside.) see attached img for ref.<br>
<br>
2. <span style="color:#000080">How important are the Combine Clusters? (next to the 357 area and the one opposing it next to the debris mound).</span> <span style="color:#004080">Alternative…put blown out buildings in their place.</span><br>
see attached img for ref - left to the circled windows is a Combine Cluster.<br>
<br>
i'm at work now so i can't add screens; let me know if those are needed to better understand the locations in question.<br>

	<div class="content">why would you take out the windows? just wondering.  From outside you can sneak from the x-bow and take shots at the rpg area.  or nade the 2nd floor.  From inside you can smg_nade the mound and jump out of the window on the southeast side.<br>
<br>
But main thing the closed windows would do is make the 2nd floor easier to hold and thus making it harder to get control of the RPG if the other team has it.<br>

i was referring to the southern windows only. Not the northern one (where I can clearly see the advantage of leaving as is).<br>
I’m still not sure what is the tactic involving using the southern windows? Can u explain? You can't move in or out of them as they are player clipped. Only the northern windows aren't.<br>

good point. only alas, i'm done with renewing all its brushwork already  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> . at least 90% if not more of its brushwork has been completley redone from the ground up and the rest has been all checked and not a stone unturned. I can only assume the brushword errors affected its FPS...that, and the fact there's a hilarious ammount of props. <br>
I left the compile running when i went to work so later on today i'll see if (and how) my brushwork changed things.<br>
<br>
i dont care if ppl with complain as long as i get a solid positive reaction from competative gamers here. that - and the fact its a long personal challenge of mine - was the reason for me to do this in the first place.<br>
<br>
the fact OW is a KOTH type of map basically sets its purpose. i'm not sure if there is a way of making a KOTH map with high FPS...on the other hand how can a KOTH map be really competative? so, we think alike and still ..might be nice, even if for a limited circle of players, having a better-smoother version of OW.<br>

well 3 main things really:<br>
<br>
1) Increase FPS when facing the center of the map.<br>
2) tone down the dominance of the RPG spot - either by closing it a bit more or by adding high spots to even the odds.<br>
3) add pickups lol.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
About that high sniper spot from the game...here's what i was thinking... have it more or less a blown out room as oppose to the well shielded closed room you had in the game...only shielded from the xbow direction and the rpg direction by man size broken walls. one for each direction.<br>
the way to get up there is obviously by using the doorway under the NW corner awning and some fast stairs hideen inside the building. Having the whole entrance to the awning shielded from above and from the east but has slits facing the direction of the the RPG only so you can't camp there really. the idea behind the top shield is exposing the sniper spot more, making it harder to camp.<br>
as for the RPG spot, i'm definitly going with Impala's idea <blockquote class="uncited"><div>I WOULD consider lowering the RPG back wall to leave it more exposed and building up the left side to protect the bow room and that long spawn point.</div></blockquote>

another idea i had about the RPG spot is add a floor piece to block a bit of view to the stairs. <br>
<br>
Add at least 2 more HPs and a few more nades. the main problem i think in the stock version as far as weapon placement goes is the fact you have an RPG, HP and MAG all in the same spot. this should change.<br>
also, i don't see a reason to have so much physics.  quarter off the ammount is well enough. doubtless all the screens, chairs, bottles and keyboards are just plain useless and cramping up the map.<br>
<br>
What i have already done is smoothed out the debris mounds, making them easier to climb and clipped every corner, lintel and crossbar.<br>
i've also replaced all the broken floor models with brushwork to reduce polycount and removed redundant textures and entities from non-player areas.<br>
<br>
now i bet i'm gonna get home, launch DM, realize my version lags like crap, go back to the U forum and PM WT to delete this whole thread lmao.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I don't know if you've ever heard of king_air, but I have been making a KOTH map myself for nearly two years so far (still haven't gotten even the basic brushwork done). Not a DM map with KOTH in mind, but actual King of the Hill gameplay with seperate scores and whatnot.<br>
<br>
Well, what did that paragraph have to do with this topic? I have some ideas for new King maps after I'm doing with king_air, and one of them would be a map similar to overwatch but suited for 4v4 objective-based action. Overwatch has a nice circular flow around the building, and the peeking in through windows with Magnum/XBow/Nade gameplay allows for some anti-camping. The one armor in the map makes it rather frantic and even balanced for 1v1s since the guy with the RPG is easily to put a mortal wound on. The low amount of health is bothersome in any game with more than 3 players. The high skybox allows for some crazy high-lob into RPG kills, as well as other fun stuff if you can remember angles with cl_showpos.<br>
<br>
Take the good elements from Overwatch and expand them into a bigger, better map.<br>
- Circular flow. You might even want to change this to a double-building map with the 8-flow like in de_dust or dm_lockdown, with debris and hills in between them to prevent the map from becoming a sniping map.<br>
- Low health and armor. This works well for Overwatch, it's just fast-paced and frantic unlike Lockdown, where you might want to take it slow.<br>
- Prop gameplay. Overwatch has a bit too many props, but they have some ones that allow for teamwork and hinderance. Blocking entrances with props is an annoying, but viable tactic. You can slow down enemies by putting a ton of crap on a narrow hallway and snipe them. Props actually are more than just weapons in Overwatch.<br>
<br>
Fix the bad elements of Overwatch:<br>
- Size<br>
- RPG position<br>
- Too little armor/health.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

however small OW is atm....wouldn't you say it would be unnecessarily too big once doubled? (to actually mirror it back to back).<br>

I agree with Fearsome in that it will end up as a footnote really...if you fixed the unclipped areas and named it "fixed" even then some people would snub it just for that reason.

nice idea. tho i dont think it can happen with all the windows and door...it has to go on a serious diet. otherwise FPS will drop to 20 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
might be a nice theme for a custom map.. .</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">What about placing a charger on the ground level of the map to not only give people on the ground an advantage but to also give the rpg an insentive to come down from his perch?  You should implement some of the more drastic changes and then run some play testing, cause otherwise determining good/bad changes is gonna be mostly speculation/educated guessing.  Some things people are sceptical about now on the forum might actually play really well and turn out to be great or vise versa.  <br>
<br>
Might also be interesting to connect the northeast and northwestern corners through the building, possibly putting one of the elevated sniping spots near the top.  Then orient the snipe spot so your could see through the southern window of the main building to the rpg or at least to part of the rpg area.  This would make it a little bit harder to snipe someone at rpg spot because you would have to shoot through the window frame instead of having a clean shot.  Not that much more difficult but more difficult none the less.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don’t mean this to come across the wrong way...but for all new mappers who are going to use this tool. Please be respectful to others and yourself when opening other people's works. you can (and I think you should) look at how things were done but out right copy-pasting bits of or complete structures (brushwork) is dishonoring and won't get you anywhere. This tool was made by mappers for mappers to help the community learn ...not steal.<br>

So please don't try to saturate it with a lot of weapons and stuff.<br>

IMO (besides fixing some walls/windows glitches) you should add more health and suit, not too much, but a bit more.<br>

I tend to agree, even though many will protest. in reality this change can only benefit the map and well its gameplay. ppl seem to have no idea how much FPS those little buggers take.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok if you are making a completely offset map of overwatch, no one has any room to say anything about "dont touch overwatch" "its for 1v1 2v2 blah blah". If you are trying to take overwatch and re-make the original with a few differences, people will still get pissed no matter what. But like briggs idea with 3 buildings, no one can be like "YOU RUINED OVERWATCH OMG WAH" because its not like you're valve replacing an original map, just making a new one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

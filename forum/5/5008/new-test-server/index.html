	<div class="content">dm_remorse_final-2.... my only comment is regarding the suspended grate below the supercharger.  it doesnt sway, which seems unrealistic.  rather than suspend it with cables, put a center post below the grate... like a hydraulic lift from the floor that froze in place.  you could make it one larger post in the middle, or four smaller posts on each corner.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dont think he should release it. I prefer just looking at it as a portrait cause it's so perdy. I have a feeling that running around in it shooting things would remove that effect for me lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

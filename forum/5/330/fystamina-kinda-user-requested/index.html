	<div class="content"><span style="color:red"><strong class="text-strong">UPDATE</strong><br>
i just ran it on my server and for sum reason the equip thhing didnt give everyone weapons liek it did on my lan server, anyone know wtf the problem is?</span><br>
<br>
i set out to make an arena map that had no props, no smg nades, and certainly no rpg. I figured i could get somethign done in about 5 hours.... here we are 5 days later, and i think you'lll be impressed.<br>
<br>
In counter strike FY stands for fight yard, and all the weapons are put at the players feet at spawn... i just made it give you every weapon from spawn, with full ammo. Theres no extra ammo laying around, not much health and armor either, good luck with that.<br>
<br>
I wanted to have some sick ass jump pads, they turned out badass, you might think "hey stoned your a fucktard these dont work right" but once you figure out how to work them properly you'll embrace my 8 inches of hard talent faster then teto's chapped lips.<br>
<br>
I plan on making a dm version with weapons and shit in the map actually, props, and yes even an rpg... leave your feedback here, if you want to test it online, you know this shit will be on my server.<br>

<br>
I don't know if i'd say hectic since you get the 357 of the bat, it's just faster paced.  Hectic would be me getting killed trying to find a weapon before i can get one.  This really lets you spawn and get somewhere since you have a long range weapon to battle ppl back with.  <br>
<br>
<br>
this adds some super flick shot which is always great practice.  And trying to keep your aim while going 360 degrees off a jump pad hs is pimp.<br>
<br>
I didn't turn my gamme up ( have to everytime i start-up) so it was dark but that was just likely me.   A glossy look (which you said you'd add) will make the models stand out a bit more and make the level look nice. <br>
<br>
props numbers seemed good, since you can't use them with the lift, there should be just few enough  to not jam the jumps when they get dropped</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well if the saw blades were left on the ramps i noticed that they'd launch u up at a higher vertical angle and u'd smoked the light, it wasnt to bad tho because the speed of the push would get u up onto that platform without taking 10 hp tho... maybe i should add addition pushes on the ramps that only effect the props (at like foot level) that are very low, and just keep the props off the ramps..<br>
<br>
another option would be just making the pushes affect props aswell...<br>
<br>
fps was alright but the top half of the map needs to be split up with hint brushes, and i did notice with the arrows constantly being spawned all over the place that the fps progressivly got worse...<br>
<br>
i am considering making it so no weapons/ammo are dropped, to further push the 'last man standing" element, that way when u spawn u can only whore the mag for so long until you die, and the longer you live, the more time ur forced to use weapons you normally wouldnt rely on (if your not uber pro, keep in mind), and if u are uber pro, and dont get pwned by the time u use all ur ammo, all u got is u ggun and stick/bar..... i'd like opinions on this specificly, i imagine some people wont like the idea, but .. its an idea that hasn't been done yet for a aim/training map (to my knowledge).<br>
<br>
even tho i had planned not to, i've had a few people from both sides of the fence say it does indeed need an rpg, and i'm taking it into deep consideration, since it is a weapon you CAN aim, and with the speed of this level, it'll be a hell of a lot harder to use then in aim_arena. (plus i can only imagine how awesome it would be to air rocket bitches like q3 or unreal).<br>
<br>
dallas i think also suggested adding a super charger on 1 side of the tallest point, and the rpg on the otherside, but i think the best place for the rpg would be floating down in the fan room, since it's the most isolated location in the map, and difficult to move thru if you haven't figured out the ramps.. .and if i do that, one side on the top with a super charger would make a very well balanced map seem not so well balanced, maybe add 2 super chargers on each side, but make each only give you 100 armor some how, but since i already have 2 30 armor chargers, i think that'd be over doing it on the armor.<br>
<br>
voxtex suggested more health, but with the 2 health chargers, and 2 packs at the very top i  think theres just enough, but i could take the 2 health packs out.. and replace each with 2 vials, and then on the floor level put maybe 2 more...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
the download is coming soon, the first version was seriously my first attempt at the jump ramps.. and they worked, but im taking some time to tweak them since not everyone was able to use them as easily as i may have wanted.<br>
<br>
dm_stamina_b2 is up on my server, and it does have an rpg, but rpg haters chill the fuck out:<br>
<br>
when u go for the rpg it makes a very annoying alarm sound.<br>
motion disabled on the rpg<br>
no ammo dropped when killed with rpg equipped (or any weapon)<br>
you can only shoot the rpg 3 times per life, regardless of how many times u  pick up the rpg.<br>
<br>
i had to change the ramps to allow better use of the rpg (rockets were flying into trigger_pushes that didnt need to be as high as they were) and i have noticed some screw ups with 2 of the main pushes i modified,, they'll be fixed soon.<br>
<br>
also added some cover for the health/suit charges, which means they're not right out in the open, but... well check it out and tell me what u think about how i did that part.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I wanted everyones opinion on this.<br>
<br>
Should i name it dm_stamina, or fy_stamina?<br>
<br>
for those of you who do not know what fy is, it means Fight Yard, and i believe it originated in counter strike. In CS's fy you would spawn on your teams side and have every primary weapon at your feet to choose from (however you can only equip one primary at a time), but in most cases the AWP (think hl2dm's RPG) is located somewhere in the center of the map, and HE Grenades are scattered around.<br>
<br>
i did stamina almost exactly like this, however you spawn with every weapon + full ammo accept for the rpg (located in the center of the map), only 2 grenades, no orbs, no smg nades.<br>
<br>
so should i adopt fy? - i think this would attract newer players to it out of interest, and since the map includes a different style of deathmatch play i think it'd be more appropriate.<br>
<br>
or should i just stick with dm? - i dont want anyone to consider this map "not deathmatch". Its essentially aim arena on a coke binge, or a killbox that requires more than just the ability to hold the rpg.<br>
<br>
input please.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

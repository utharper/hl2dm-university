	<div class="content">I think the textures look fine as far as how you fit them together.  It is a small map and could provide for some intense game play with alot of people as was stated.  What were you orginally thinking of designing it for?  If its for a pub of 16 people you would really need to make sure there are enough weapons around.  If people spawn and cant find weapon easily before they die then they wont like the map.  Personally I would like to see a bit more variety in the landscape, its going to be hard to tell where you are when you spawn because everything looks very similar.  That said, from a technical standpoint it looks pretty good for a first map.  Good job.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

excellent review, I've found that too, testing it, when I spawn I don't know exactly where am I, I should make a v2 with the containers placed in some other way or with other colors.<br>
The guns, yeah I was lazy I put very little gun spawns.<br>
I made a solid ground brush and detailed the floor with a displacement of rocks.<br>
It's supposed to be a all vs all map, teamplay wouldn't work well here.<br>
Thanks to you and the other users who made constructive critics,<br>
<br>
oh btw, looks like noone knows how HDR works! damn, I want to make HDR maps, but oh well it's a small detail.<br>

just click expert tab when you compile and you'll see hdr compile in the 'configurations' drop down list<br>
<br>
<a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Expert_compile_mode" class="postlink">http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki ... mpile_mode</a><br>
<br>
make sure you have some env_cubemaps placed, especially where the lighting changes <br>
and move them to chest height around 56 unit i think.<br>
once its compiled jump in and type buildcubemaps in the console, restart load the map for the lovely hdr effect <br>
*PS sopmetimes you may need to load another map 1st, b4 you can see the hdr effect.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">as i suspected, its a great map <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
some suggestions: <br>
<br>
weapon placement:<br>
We are quite used to going into those containers to collect weapons, <br>
seems like a logical choice for them to be as it puts players at a slight<br>
dis-advantage<br>
weapon count needs to go up, although its a small map so youll need <br>
to balance it right, i would maybe add 2 mags, 2 shottys, 1 or 2  xbows, 1 ar2 + orb<br>
1 slam and some ammo for each but no rpg, unless its super hard to get otherwise <br>
it would kill this map. <br>
<br>
maybe you could put it here so you have to grav gun it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">

<br>
gameplay: <br>
I like the layout, dont change a thing<br>
<br>
The only suggetsion i would have would be to allow access to the top <br>
of the crates, there is a corner that is kinda a deadend, it would be<br>
a perfect location for a ladder that goes above the wall, but that is <br>
broken so only allows you access to the top of a cargo crate.<br>
*edit* i just found you can get there from the displacement<br>
<br>
Also player clip the fence, not a big issue but i like things to be smooth <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
and it can be a bit bouncy when yuo ping offf em.<br>
<br>
Sounds:<br>
have a look at the env_soundscape entity, you can find some nice outside <br>
dock sounds for this map<br>
PS you can test the sounds through the console, not in hammer unfortuantley<br>
ill post back when i remeber or find out how i did it...<br>
<br>
bad spawn point: ive found 2 Oo<br>
move this away from the crate a little mate, you spawn stuck here

	<div class="content">well the textures fit indeed,but i like to see more differents is texture. like the surounding walls, you can chop it up in more layers and give the top a other texture. brake the wall up a little bit with support/corner pillars. add some decals/overlays to the map. just ingeneral more detailing to give it a more realistic look.<br>
and look out with the hdr it can be very annoting while playing if you make it to strong.<br>

	<div class="content">for a first map this rocks. Great Job and keep it up.<br>
<br>
a bit of correction as for HDR .. .<br>
<br>
when you bring up the Hammer Compiler (<strong class="text-strong">press F9</strong>) check the box that says <strong class="text-strong">HDR</strong> and run the compiler.<br>
When it finished, launch the game and load your new map<br>
open console and type <strong class="text-strong">buildcubemaps</strong><br>
when this finishes type <strong class="text-strong">sv_cheats 1</strong><br>
type <strong class="text-strong">mat_hdr_enable 0</strong><br>
type <strong class="text-strong">buildcubemaps</strong> (yes, again!)<br>
load a different map.<br>
load your new map again now. you're done<br>
<br>
another correction about Cubemaps height. that should be 64 units in DM. it's lower for CS:S but you plays that nowadays, right?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

out there with the same name, you'll find ppl get the "your map differs" error they seldom take to time <br>

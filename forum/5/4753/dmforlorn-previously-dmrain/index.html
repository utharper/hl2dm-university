	<div class="content">This is my second map, which took everything I had learnt from the first and put it into another bread and butter Half Life 2: Deathmatch map, developed in less than half the time of the first.<br>
<br>
It is a relatively small map, which has been designed to play nice and tight and fast, with sull support for teamplay.<br>
<br>
Finally got around to uploading a final version, including a name change and many of the changes that were suggested from around the place. Grab it now and enjoy!<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">LINK TO FINAL VERSION</strong>: <a href="http://www.filefront.com/15702465/dm_forlorn.rar/" class="postlink">http://www.filefront.com/15702465/dm_forlorn.rar/</a><br>
<br>
There was some issues with the env_fog_controller on nvidia chipsets, where it would render much differently to how it did on my 4670. As such, I uploaded the second beta version which is identical to the first, only with the fog removed.<br>

	<div class="content">Pros:<br>
Lovely map<br>
the mood is set very nicely, and the lighting is appropriate.<br>
Nice size for my prefered gameplay<br>
It feels very confusing, very good for stalking up on people and then boom!<br>
<br>
Con:<br>
grenades bounce off the very low skybox, looking very unrealistic. although if fps will suffer it is not that serious.<br>
<br>
Suggestions:<br>
A no rpg version. (perhaps with two hp packs there instead, or crossbow ammo)<br>
As there are lots of random and difficult to spot physics lying around slams would be a superb accompaniment.<br>
<br>
make a slam version and a norpg version and you will be in my good book forever.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This is a super looking map, I have a few different points to make:<br>
<br>
Some use of extra lightmaps will really add to the shadows, sharpen them up as you obviously have very nice light angles judging by how the door frames and window frames let through light.<br>
<br>
Also, some playerclips on the stairs and other surfaces where you think players may 'stick'.<br>
<br>
And, use of hintbrushes to optimise the map.  It's not great fps on lower spec machines.<br>
<br>
That said, I would guess you spent some time studying real world locations. I particularly like the garage, that is very realistic and the amount of detail is stunning throughout the map.<br>
<br>
Great work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

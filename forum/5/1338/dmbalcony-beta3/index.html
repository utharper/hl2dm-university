	<div class="content">dm_balcony is based on various gameplay and architecture ideas I've been collecting for years now. It's a small to medium sized map with lots of height variation. The layout turned out to flow nicely in playtests, and (unless I broke something with the changes in the new Beta3 release) it should run quite stable and with good performance.<br>
<br>
This seems to be a place with a lot of passion for HL2DM, the game I still like mapping for the most, so I'd love to hear your feedback. I consider this to be in a close to final stage, but I'm more than willing to change parts if it helps to improve the map.<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">i really liked the look of this map especially the arches, rooftops, all good. but the only flaw was that i felt restricted in movement near the stairs and spiral stairs. it felt cramped with all the railings. other than that, really good map reaper<br>

	<div class="content">I played the earlier version of this mapb and I think its a great pub map.  Lots of different areas to go and places to hide as well as open areas.  I thought it flowed fairly well and it was fun to play. It will definatly find a spot on the Khaos pub.  Nice job.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

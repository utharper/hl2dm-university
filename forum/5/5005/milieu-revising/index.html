Valar is thinking of revising Milieu, moving the spawns around and changing the weapons.  This is not a new layout design.<br>

i'd actually rather move on. however i've been getting feedbacks on few issues in Milieu concerning weps and spawns so i figured a revision might be called for.<br>

what are your suggestions for Warlock?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yes, i would like to see either the weaps or the spawns tinkered with.  maybe its just my dumb luck, but i seem to spawn repeatedly at the crossbow next to the supercharger.  if i die 30 times in a scrim, it seems like 10 or 12 are spawn deaths in that area (sometimes from the same fucking orb!).  yea yea, i know... don't rush back into the match.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ahhhhh, i was under the impression you already had suggestions and ideas for change.<br>
<br>
okay, from the crossbow near the supercharger there are 6 spawns where a player can just stay in one position and cover all six spawns.  that seems like an above average opportunity for a spawnkill.  from that same position, w/o moving, the person can cover all 3 choke points into that area (whorbhouse hall, wagonyard, undercharger).<br>
<br>
i don't know the solution, but thats a very powerful position on the map to hold.  the position can be broken with time and coordination (waiting for orbs back in S-hall and smg nades back in courtyard).  <br>
<br>
some of those 6 spawnpoints should be eliminated or moved.  where?  i dont really know.  there are only 2 spawns in the wagon area (mag and by the hemp bails).  one in the ledge mag area (mid ledge), 2 in the loft, none by the curving half-wall, none by rpg, cave, bridge (i suicided 40 times anyway and never spawned back there), none in the courtyard, 2 in the S-hall.<br>
<br>
weapon movement?  i dunno bout that.  maybe swap one orb from the whorbhouse with the smg nade near the landbridge and the other orb from whorbhouse with the smg nade near the wagonyard hemp bails?  that might make orb gathering a little riskier and promote more movement out of that crossbow area.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Open up the Crossbow room upstairs to the roof above the Wagon.<br>
That would help challenge domination of that entire side of the map.<br>
<br>
Also, go back to a speed ladder up out of the rpg. Two guys dominating the Orb/Charger area can get there in seconds and RPG is a sitting duck.<br>
<br>
That would make for a less dominant control map.<br>
<br>
Maybe the Hall from AR2 to the open rpg area should curve, to allow sneaking closer in there.<br>
That would still allow orbs and bank shots out there from inside but not so treacherous.<br>
<br>
Just some thoughts.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

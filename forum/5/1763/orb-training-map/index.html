	<div class="content">I would really like someone to make and orb training map.  It would need to have several spawn point so at least 10 people can use the map at the same time.     I envision a large room where several people can practice with each other maybe with some walls to bounce the orbs off for angles.  Then off the large room, I would like to see a hallway with a series of dead end hallways coming off that where people (one person to a hallway) can practice sending out an orb and have it bouce back to them so they can practice deflecting it.  This would be especially nice if there were no other people in the server so that people can still practice orb skills.<br>
<br>
All weapons except gravity gun, pulse rifle (no bullets) and grenades and maybe some props (small file cabinets, radiators, etc) in the large room.<br>
<br>
I actually have a concept drawing for what could be the large room that if I knew how to make it I would.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think I'd rather play lockdown and ask someone to spam me with orbs.<br>
It's more natural IMO.<br>
Anyway, if someone did this map, don't leave the orbs just on the ground. Gravity gun might grab them and get u killed (if while on an orb fight)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

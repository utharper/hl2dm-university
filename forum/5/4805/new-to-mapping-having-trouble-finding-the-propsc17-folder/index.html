	<div class="content">I am currently working on my first map and running into some problems.  I talked to Valar on steam some questions on how to do a couple things that I could not figure out.  He explained to me what to do, however, the folder he mentioned, I can not find.  Well there is one location I have found, which is in the home server on my computer.  However, I figured there would be one in the actual folder the mapping program is pulling files from.  I can not seem to find it though.<br>
<br>
The folder I am looking for is models/props_c17.  I have went to the hl2mp folder, and from there you can find some models folders, but none have that in it.  <br>
<br>
hl2mp\models\ShaderTest<br>
or<br>
hl2mp\materials\models\shadertest<br>
<br>
Is there a particular addon for this to get to these files?  Forgive me if I sound ignorant, as I am very new to mapping.  Thanks</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The standard hl2 content (models, maps, textures etc) is not located in your filesystem, it is all contained inside GCF files. <br>

If you want to look inside the GCF files you need <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/GCFScape" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline">GCFScape</span></a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, I followed another thread where that was mentioned.  I installed that along with all the images I could get from your links that you posted.  Have not messed with it yet though I probably should lol.  Just a lot of information on mapping lol.  Taking what I can in day by day.<br>

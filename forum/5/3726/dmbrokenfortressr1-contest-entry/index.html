	<div class="content">Hey everyone. Here is the long awaited <strong class="text-strong">DM_BROKENFORTRESS</strong>.<br>
<br>
I have always been a fan of the lostvillage type atomosphere so before you just look at the screens don't judge it without playing it!!<br>
The map took me about a month to make, with breaks in between, for overall span of about 3 months. <br>
Any comments are welcome good and bad; I would like to know what all the judges thought of my map and what its bigest downfall was for not making the top 3. Thanks WT for putting on the contest, it produced alot of great maps and I am happy that I could take part in it!<br>

I know we've had beef or whatever, but I don't think you had a "biggest downfall." The map is very well put together. I only had two problems with it. The lostvillage type theme and how the items seemed grouped together. Otherwise, the map is great. The other ones were just better... : /</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This map needs alot of work. I hope you continue to work on it. Things I noticed after a 10 minute runthrough were just little things really. Textures not lining up, brushs that stuck out a bit further then they should (or not as far) and also you have some models that are not flush to the ground. The one that is some type of water fountain isnt flush to the ground, nor is at least one of the larger crates. The layout is nice, but there are alot of little things that need fixed up. I would have a hard time putting this map in my rotation because of it's size. It would have to be perfect for me to do so and as of now, its not. If you need me to give you screenshots of everything I noticed, just holler.<br>
<br>
I also agree with para, you really should of went with a different theme. You and Valar have ran the lost village look into the ground lol. There was a time when I wanted to see more maps with the LV look, now I hope to never see another one again haha.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just had a run around it and I like it a lot.<br>
There were a few small things which if changed I think could make the map a little smoother.<br>
<br>
The back of this ladder could do to be playerclipped as I got caught on it a few times when bunnyhopping through the map.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Screen:</strong> <a href="http://i44.tinypic.com/wulz6p.jpg" class="postlink">http://i44.tinypic.com/wulz6p.jpg</a><br>
<br>
These wooden planks could do to be a bit higher so you can bunnyhop through or jump from that window ledge without having to run down to the exposed bit next to it.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Screen:</strong> <a href="http://i41.tinypic.com/ff2xd1.jpg" class="postlink">http://i41.tinypic.com/ff2xd1.jpg</a><br>
<br>
This path looked a bit messy to me and would look a lot nicer if the corners were made using the arch tool rather than just cutting the brushes.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Screen:</strong> <a href="http://i40.tinypic.com/x6kidc.jpg" class="postlink">http://i40.tinypic.com/x6kidc.jpg</a><br>
<br>
This broken wall could do to be either higher at the end so you can jump through or lower so it doesn't look like you can jump through because I got stuck there a couple of times too.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Screen:</strong> <a href="http://i44.tinypic.com/2lucqax.jpg" class="postlink">http://i44.tinypic.com/2lucqax.jpg</a><br>
<br>
Also the truck near the tank would be better playerclipped so that you can jump over it without getting caught.<br>
I liked the layout a lot and the RPG area in particular although I think the main issue layout wise is the connectivity of the upper levels isn't great and I think with a few small links it could be improved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes I sure can explain. <br>
Here are maps that I consider to have Lost Village inspired textures. dm_is_alive, dm_milieu, dm_warlock, dm_mudafuga, dm_losthope and dm_ftw has a section that has similar Lost Village textures. Now, the only one that is questionable in that list is losthope, which has a more desert like theme, but it still looks similar. Now, there is also, dm_lostvillage_r1, dm_lostvillage_two, dm_lostvillage_v2 and now dm_brokenfortress_r1. Most of these have been made within the last year or so. There is nothing wrong with any of them either, in fact, milieu is one of my favorite maps, but my point is still valid. When so many of these village themed maps have came out, new ones start to feel repetitive and old, regardless of the layout. The "freshness" is gone.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

How could Mudafuga be anything like LV?  The textures are no where near anything like LV and neither is Milieu.  FTW was a map he threw together for the hell of it.  Alive and Warlock .....hmm  yea there are some brick textures but it doesn't mean they were inspired by LV.<br>
<br>
In fact the only map that was "inspired" by LV is losthope and that is more in terms of layout than anything else and IMO a VAST improvement over LV hands down!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's very logical. You asked me why, I told you why. Sure, not all those maps look just like LV or have the exact same LV texture set, but the textures, to me, are extremely similar. And if it's not the textures, it is something else. To me, the whole tan/de_dust/LV/PVK II look is just getting old now. It's just an opinion.<br>

Im not posting in the mapping section to boost egos, I generally post here to make mappers make better maps. I would expect nothing less then that from anyone else. Saying "Woohoo!, thats awesome!" on a map that has alot of small things wrong with it doesn't help Dallas at all. <br>
<br>
What I said about the theme has to do with how I felt running around the map and it is 100% OPINION. I didnt feel inspired. I guess I was wanting more, thats all. dm_fraggingyard (aka dm_armegeddon) and lost_village_two are really nice and I was expecting to be blown away this time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As para wrote, the only map i made that was inspired by Lost Village was Lost Hope and i actually posted about it out right from the start. needless to mention, the end result hardly resembles Lost Village. Here again, you will need to be in REM to find similarities.<br>
True, if you want to help someone make better maps you don't have to boost their egos but you don't necessarily need to bring their egos down.

So I guess Ill treat this as hostile.<br>
<br>
Those maps I mentioned all look similar. If I took any of those maps and asked someone that played the game 3 years ago and hasnt been around since, what map he thought they looked like, it would be LV. You obviously seem to care for some reason about the fact that I think this look is getting boring, not sure why, but whatever. As I said, that is my opinion.

LOL ok. Hopefully Dallas isnt crying in the corner from my so called trashing. Im glad I avoided posting my thoughts on a few of your maps. From the way you handle my criticism and opinions, you might of committed suicide. You need to stop taking an opinion so seriously. You will never get better at mapping if you bitch and moan about every criticism made to your maps. You think Im trashing? Im being gentle.

Admittedly this isnt a very big percentage of his maps considering how many he has done, but also look around.  It is hard to find any pub that does not have at least one of Valars maps.  If they were crap, they would not be run.  I will also add that in developing maps, Valar has consulted with MANY people in the community on many of his maps.  He has taken many of the opinions expressed to him and did something with them.  The problem with opinions is, like buttholes, everyone has one and often it is difficult to reconcile the differences you inevitably hear.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think with new models and textures it would have done a lot better.  Since when you first load the map you instantly notice the Humvee from Lostvillage_two, then the fountain, and the trees.  Then the tank.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If they were crap, they would not be run.  I will also add that in developing maps, Valar has consulted with MANY people in the community on many of his maps.  He has taken many of the opinions expressed to him and did something with them.  The problem with opinions is, like buttholes, everyone has one and often it is difficult to reconcile the differences you inevitably hear.</div></blockquote>
When did I say that every one of his maps looked the same? Or when did I say that I didnt like any of the maps I listed? Yup, thats right, I didnt. I said they (being the ones I listed) all looked similar, due to the textures that were used. Which comes to my point about ME getting tired of maps that have a lost village look and feel to them. The bottom line is, everytime I make any comment on Valar's maps (or posts  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused">), he gets all defensive. I never put him or his maps down. I said the look is getting overdone. He takes it as some evil post from hell and starts making comments about me somehow being insane for thinking that way. Pretty retarded if you ask me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Radiators look a little ou of place perhaps.<br>
<br>
<br>
Can get caught on these wall due to the different angles it occurs through out the map.  Simple clipping thingy.<br>

Same spot but this hump is a little high and can hinder a player. It stops me dead when walkin in the direction i am facing.<br>

LoL, yea I made the map more for eye candy than anything, next time I will definently take that in to consideration, I thought hmm if people like how it looks they would vote it. And ya, there are a few texture issues, working them out now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm scratchin my head on the filesize, there's plenty of stuff here that could be from the hl2 gcf like Popper said, I'm not sure. On top of that I run all setings low on default, and<br>
it looks as if a) they are 512x textures scaled up to .40 or b) they're 256x. So that is my<br>
impression withour bumpmapping etc.<br>
<br>
You've made this much more unique than just an LV clone. It's so happy!:P I kept feeling<br>
that my FOV had changed somehow, it feels "wide", not in a bad way, just visually.<br>
<br>
I see a bit of LV in here. I was driving around today and noticed a lot of grass/ stone wall combinations throughout the city, it wasn't hard to make the "LV connection". Layout reminds me more of Rigormortis without the roof access. <br>
<br>
My comments are just aesthetics, quite a few spots could be tweaked without losing frames<br>
etc. I noticed a few misaligned textures, odd design choices and strange brushworks as noted<br>
above. The one that sticks out is at the supercharger jump, did you leave that 1 unit lip<br>
there on purpose? Also there's a circular wall with no fence behind it, makes me wonder why<br>
I can fall off one side and not the other. One or two lighting anomalies.<br>
<br>
I would hazard a guess that this will get pretty frantic despite its apparent size. Awesome map!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">One thing that is fairly annoying about maps with teleporters is that when you teleport as the same time as someone else, there is a chance that you will get stuck in that person. Avalon is the easiest example to think of. In other games, such as quake, when you teleport behind someone or teleport ontop of someone, it telefrags them or kills them. Is there a way to trigger damage associated to a certain player at the teleport exit upon entering a teleport? Just an interesting idea I was thinking about, may not be possible or practical, but throwin it out there anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

going in a the same time, idk how you would solve that. but i know valar does a cool thing with his teleports where upon exit you are pushed forward so if somebody comes out behind you that doesnt happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I much prefer getting pushed forward, getting telefragged is annoying. Telefragging does happen in hl2dm if two players spawn same time same point, and I find that equally annoying.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">There are a number of ways to deal with this. Classically in most games people disable the teleport then push the player out of the way then enable it again so the next player can go through. It just takes a little extra work for mappers. Rotating exits is another option that is popular. This is another reason why updating maps is a good strategy I get chastised for often. Get updates which correct the problems with teleports and other issues out so a map can become better then it was before no mapper no matter how good makes a perfect map the first time improving it through many iterations makes it the best it can be for everyone from pubs to league play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Are you after a salary as my official spokesperson?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
Getting quite mixed feedback about this. Some people have said they like it this way for 1v1 / 2v2 etc as it makes you work the map for tools, and others have said they would like more stuff to play with. <br>
<br>
Will look at the possibility of doing a datacore_r1 with the help from you nice HL2DMU peeps when I can tear myself away from my comp entry <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

why more weapons ?? if ya walk a certain route you get all weapons fast enough. the only thing you miss are those ar2 altfire box and rpg box and they were spamming that area anyway and that small hallway with health package and battery's. so what you can do is split those over the map but i dont think its necassary since you can hold a good control over the map if you use a certain strategy <br>

what i do find out though and problably a couple of more people <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> you can grab the rpg with your grav gun i dont know if that was meant to be ??<br>

Because when there are more than about 4 people in the map, you tend to spawn with nothing unless you have a lucky spawn near an item.  The map is big enough for more people.  If it is to become a competative map, it will need a few more weaps, nothing crazy though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

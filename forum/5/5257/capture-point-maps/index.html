Because about ten minutes of Googling didn't turn anything up, I decided I might aswell ask here.<br>

Is there such thing as a cp map in hl2dm?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Bisounours was a fun mod, sadly the Devs gave up on it. To quote the Devs " there were only two players and maybe one server some where in India, we have decided to go do some drugs and are releasing the source code for the players to finish"<br>
<br>
It's so odd that so many mods come out that are really fun to play, but people can't be bothered to take the time to DL and play something different once in awhile.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The vmf is one I made so yeah, I know how to do it. I used warpath as my tutorial on how to do it. I stripped it all down though to the basic cp logics. Basically its a map with 5 cps and a wall next to each that has a color block to show which cps belong to combine and which belong to the rebels and the cp model I had made for it. Granted, the pic here is with Hl2:CTF, but the logics are the same as in dm. I built this to show the hl2ctf devs what all went into making a cp map in hl2dm/hl2ctf work. So it is what it is.<br>
<img src="http://www.cgc-online.net/_img/push_logics_1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
The biggest issue with cp though is that there isnt a "round_end" like in TF2. Therefore, you have to kill all the players on the map in order to start the round over. Just check out warpath for hl2dm if you want to get a better under standing of how cp works in dm. The vmf I built is based off of it's logics and is basically identical other then the much improved capture point model.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yes there is. Try playing on this server <br>
94.75.238.115:27015 - Nemesis ctf (Nederlands)<br>
<br>
In that server there's 3 capture point maps running in it's map cycle. <br>
Warpath<br>
Powerplant<br>
Avanti (this one requires a flag to be caried through points)<br>
<br>
And then it has some more maps that are capture the flag.<br>
2fort<br>
Terminal<br>
School<br>
Bedroom Warfare<br>
Forest Fortress<br>
Pedestal<br>
NFS<br>
and more...<br>
<br>
There are not many ctf/cp maps in hl2dm bacause it's not easy to make it work well. In all they must not be more than 20-25 maps.<br>
<br>
The only problem I see in these maps are that some of them were made from porting Team Fortress maps into hl2dm, and the mapper was noobish enough to make the weapons and items layout annalogous to TF's ammo rooms... This creates a noobish cheap-spam-fest all over them all. It's not very hard in these maps to see 8 players with RPG fighting 8 players with RPG. It's that cheap.<br>
<br>
The maps that came next unfortunately were made following the same trend, so they aren't much better. The only map that can be considered a better map (in my honest and worthless opinion) is ctf_terminal, which has a decent weapons layout, and mimics quake flag system (can't capture the flag while enemy holds my flag).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That could possibly work, but Im pretty sure the strip part doesnt work very well in hl2dm. As for Kusa's vmfs, I have Avanti, rock2, warpath, 2fort, and Well. When I had access to his ftp, those were basically all that was in there. Jump pads are easy though and I believe the flag at base map you are talking about is Avanti.

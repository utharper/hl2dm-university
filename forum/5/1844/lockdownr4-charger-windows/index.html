<br>
yes in r3 you can shoot an orb through them, but you can't shoot someone in the charger room with:<br>
pistol,smg,ar2,shotgun,357,xbow,nade<br>
<br>
smg_nade and RPG don't on either but that makes sense.<br>
<br>
bursting a ar2 shot into the window then firing the orb through isn't that hard.  I don't see any reason to change the bars, or do anything other then fixes etc</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This has nothing to do with bolts or the glass or how the glass works, windows can be made any size or shape with any type of glass, what he is talking about is the bars that divide each window. He is asking if people would like to have less or none of them because they block jumping and moving out of the windows. With them there you have to be a little more careful when jumping out and 1 of them also makes it hard to get a xbow shot from the charger down the side hall. Think of it as he just wants bigger or wider windows so movement is less restricted.<br>
<br>
Changing them would have the following effects on the game:<br>
more physics would fall out of the charger room<br>
orbs would exit and and enter the charger room more while bouncing around. <br>
people would be able to make more jumps into and out of the charger room to more places.<br>
some shots from the charger to the side hall would become easier or possible. <br>
<br>
Now all you have to do is decide if those kinds of effects are good or bad.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i voted untouched cause valve made the map that way for a reason. less bars i could see maybe giving alot of nubs a little more movement when it comes to jumping out. but I personally dont have any problem jumping from charger to barrels or from charger to any spot on the catwalk. there is one xbow bounce that i invented that cant go all the way down side hall because of the bar thats there. it does make it to the crate/hp charger room but hits about one unit too far to the right and will not go down the hall. its mostly because of that bar. I could really care less if there were less bars or not. my point is that we all had to learn how to jump out the windows in a careful manner, and now so should everyone else.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The double meele equip problem (which may cause a crash on start, and a floating stunstick)<br>
The spectate bug on start (which does cause a crash on start)<br>
The vent to rpg is to sensitive<br>

Id wouldn't mind missing bars since I do hit them sometimes on accident jumping in and out of the charger room, but I wouldn't like all the props flying out of that room and cluttering the floor below.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I just changed my mind, your right nino and I hate that. Please change the windows back to like before! Also as far as the orb breaking the window, its not critical as like nino said you can shoot it first and when fast balling it goes like mad in there anyway, likely hitting someone as they try to run out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Doh! your right, I guess its been so long since I played something other than r3 I forgot about that. It sure seems like a bullet from a 357 would have no problem going through glass and hitting a target though, can it be done?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's not likely without some major trickery, the problem is the more you try to force the game to do something it was not set up to easily do the more other bugs and exploits seem to pop up. Like all the time I spent trying to stop duck sprinting only to have it accidentally suck people in the vent. The way the game works all bullets are basically single use. They can hit 1 and only 1 item and they are done. <br>
<br>
These are the only difference between the r3 glass and the regular ld glass.<br>
xbow does not penetrate.<br>
Orb does break and go through.<br>
broken glass does not stay and hinder your view.<br>
glass does not make a sound when you jump through breaking it.<br>
*when shooting the r3 glass with any bullets players tended to lag or stop for unknown reasons.<br>

I am now working on r4 and I have solved the last point which was the major problem with the current glass thanks to Luke finding an alternate solution.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

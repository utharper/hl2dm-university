For some reason I sometimes get over them, and they just don't move. I try jumping and stuff and nothing. Once I get out of them, they go up -.-<br>
Besides while playing CAL 1v1 against my mate, we tied 9-9, which could have been 10-9 if I hadn't suicided with it.<br>
I somehow got stuck, I had like 100 hp and 30 suit, and lost everything.<br>

Yeah the elevator is kind of a p.i.t.a and I've suicided on it countless times...but eh it happens. I'm not too worried about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You know the elevator outside? lets say I shot the grenade near that "sheet metal" or whatever it's called, which is on the floor above.<br>
The idea was that the elevator would take Briggs upwards, where the nade had been thrown. Is it better explained now? XD<br>
The problem was that he didn't go upwards due to this bug or whatever, and the nade just exploded on the upper part, damaging no one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
this is the way I built the triggers in lostarena for lifts:<br>

<a href="http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=lostarena_liftcme.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=lost ... iftcme.jpg</a><br>
<br>
(you can see them by turning on sv_cheats and using "show_triggers_toggle"..<br>
<br>
every construction of an elevator has a disadvantage.. that sucks. I tried this method on lostarena because I thaught it would be good <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> but sometimes they confuse even me. what method would you prefer?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just regular lifts like you find in your average killbox, they are triggered when you touch them (sorry I am not a mapper I don't know the attribute that does it).<br>
<br>
EDIT: If you would like to release an updated version (r2 or v2 or whatever) I will update the map pack with it and I am sure it will be used in CAL.<br>
<br>
EDIT2: Was this to avoid the 100 tick bug? Maybe the trigger can lie flat on top of the lift so when you fall on it, it still goes?<br>
<br>
Whatever you decide I recommend thorough testing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I Would really like this to be fixed, because I really like that map and it's a shame that it is ruined by this.<br>
I even have the demo of the moment when I suicided in the CAL 1v1.<br>
Can't you make it go down in case something stucks on it?<br>

I removed those trigger_multiples and made the func_doors "touchable". I only tested it on local server and on our linux server.<br>

	<div class="content">1. Maps should be tested to run on both windows and linux servers.<br>
<br>
2. Maps should be fully packed. Optional: a readme.txt and a .res file that points to it. This allows people to dump a downloaded map directly into their maps folder.<br>
<br>
3. Maps should have LDR lightmaps. ie. Not fullbright or HDR lightmaps only.<br>
<br>
4. All map names should always be in lower case eg. dm_mymap_v3. This prevents redirect downloads causing problems on linux servers.<br>
<br>
5. Maps should be prefixed with <strong class="text-strong">dm_</strong> unless designed for a specific type of play:<br>
    <br>
   <strong class="text-strong">tr_</strong> for training maps<br>
   <strong class="text-strong">ctf_</strong> for capture the flag<br>
   <strong class="text-strong">cp_</strong> for capture point<br>
<br>
6. Short, one word map names are more memorable and easier to manage than long multiple word names. For killboxes, it is traditional to place the word killbox after the dm prefix. eg. dm_killbox_mymap.<br>
   <br>
7. Maps that are in beta stage should be clearly labelled as such with the word beta as the suffix. eg. dm_mymap_beta1, dm_mymap_beta2.<br>
<br>
8. Intial release of your map should just be the full name of the map. eg. dm_mymap<br>
For maps that are a complete rebuild of an existing map from the ground up, it is common to use the suffix <strong class="text-strong">_reloaded</strong>.<br>
<br>
9. Subsequent fixes or changes to the map should be released with a numbered suffix. once you decide on a suffix, stick with it. Common suffixes are "r" for revision and "v" for version. Try to avoid using "b" as this is often confused for beta. eg. dm_mymap_r1, dm_mymap_r2. Ent edited/server side fixes to maps are best avoided because the clients have no way of knowing which version they are playing until they test or check the issue that was fixed. Always rename and re-release if you change your map. <br>
<br>
10. It is preferable to have one map that is balanced in such a way that it can be played in any mode, rather than multiple releases of the same map for different modes (ffa, 1v1, tdm etc).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'd like to see the continual trend of naming killbox maps with the suffix <strong class="text-strong">kb_</strong> i.e. kb_sonar<br>
Is this something you at the U would consider promoting too?<br>

	<div class="content">tr for training map is a good idea, because the idea is not to deathmatch in it. Separating killbox out from deathmatch is not logical in my thinking because even though it is a different style of map you are still "deathmatching" in it. Sticking with dm also is consistent with most of the popular killbox maps out there currently. I just sorted my map list and got a bunch of dm_killbox_etc. but none starting with kb_. I think dm_killbox_namehere is a good rule to follow.<br>
<br>
I also think this promotes the concept that killbox is an entirely different world from "regular deathmatch", whereas this site is about unification of the community. ctf on the other hand actually tells you that the map has an objective as opposed to pure killing.<br>
<br>
I would have to say the same about arenas. There is also the point that one mans arena is another mans killbox, is another maps regular map. In other words the lines between such maps are so subjective, I would prefer not to define them. I don't even like aim_prefix much, although I certainly understand why it was used, for much the same reasons as using tr_, it was originally an aim training map.<br>
<br>
Having said all this, I am open to further reasoning on the subject, we can refine these rules into something that is a good standard for everyone.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you are right, the ultimate aim is the same although I still think there is room to say that we are also kill<span style="color:#004080">ing in a</span>box. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Walking Target wrote:</cite>I also think this promotes the concept that killbox is an entirely different world from "regular deathmatch", whereas this site is about unification of the community. </div></blockquote>

another good point. <br>
however, couldn't Killbox be a different world? without it being derogatory? is that something people would like see the U promoting? I know this debate has kinda come up before..<br>
It has its own style of play and skill base and host of extremely talented players. <br>

<img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> very good point the lines can be hard to define. But that would be the mappers choice same a choosing the name. At the moment deathmatch is a generic term that catches all, it could still be that for when a mapper doesn't know where their map belongs. And really the suffix would only act as a guide. <br>
I like the idea of mapping outside of the definition (tradition) anyway, the suffix wouldn't slow ME down <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

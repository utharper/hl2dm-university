	<div class="content">There's been quite a few factors that are halting me from working further on king_air and any other HL2DM maps for that matter:<br>
<br>
- Computer broke. I lost my king_air and every other VMF, although I can easily get it back from someone who had the map and can decompile, then send it to me. Editing Kusa's KOTH file to raise the timer from 100 to 300 AGAIN, as well as changing the announcements, is irritating but can be done in about one or two hours.<br>
<br>
- TF2 came out. This probably lodged the axe in HL2DM's population further more, especially the CTF Community.<br>
<br>
- The community itself. I know some people who've been playing this game for 2 years, CTF maps only of course. And they suck donkey balls. I've scrimmed against these people in both CTF and DM maps, and they played exactly the same as they did before, HORRIBLY. The pub scene of HL2DM and HL2DMCTF just blows. At least CS has several decent players due to CS's rise in popularity during ~2001 and the numerous veterans. Even if I do make a good map, it'll go unappreciated. People will butcher the map with stupid settings that it wasn't intended to be played on, and play on it so horribly that it'll be like smudging their crap all over it. I could include various tactical options for a player by adding ramp-jumpable areas, jump pads, and all kinds of jumbo, but all the work put into that kind of stuff will go wasted because 99% of the players will ignore it.<br>
<br>
- Lost interest. I haven't played HL2DM in a while before, so I pretty much don't play any more "competitive" games now. I'd get back in if it had a more thriving community since TF2's a great game, but has too much luck and such counted into it. Fortress Forever, eh. Not a game I'd want to scrim in often.<br>
<br>
Now, if there would be a small, albeit EXISTING community who would perhaps play such maps the way they were meant to, I would still map. Even if we managed to get a weekly or every-2-weeks scrim or something,  that would be something to map for. But no, I'm stuck with this crappy CTF community, and rather small competitive scene.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If people get tired of the latest and greatest and come back it's likely worth it. If numbers continue to decline, then probably not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">What the hl2dm competitive community needs to do is move to a solid, tournament-oriented mod and never look back. Always being reliant on valve for updates, fixes and new content just guarantees that this games core competitive population will never really grow and is only likely to diminish over time.<br>
<br>
As for mapping... ive been working on a pair of projects for some time, an arena and a micro-map (tigcrik sized). I dont imagine theyll be particularly appreciated either, but then im making the maps for myself first and everyone else second, so theyll get the appreciation that counts- mine.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You got the point.<br>
<br>
hl2dm pro was a good "attempt"... But their aim was more something like HLDM:S I think (?) But of course they did a good job on it, fixed a lot of bugs and glitches (scoreboard ...).<br>
<br>
Well, I played a bit TF2 now and I think this is Valves new multiplayer "baby" - maybe even a replacement for CS:S and DOD:S? but they put definitely A LOT of work in it.. <br>
<br>
Something like HL2 : DM Reloaded would be very cool.. take hl2dm as it is now, fix all the bugs, add some new game modes (CTF and DOM eg), remove those crap maps like dm_resistance (or make them at least playable for 1on1..) add some more maps and we would have a great new game. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"><br>
Honestly I would pay maybe about 30$ to valve for something like this.<br>
<br>
just my 2 cents...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So far as I have seen there has been almost no effect on the CTF HL2DM community, I still see just as many servers with just as many players running CTF maps. In fact that has been rather amusing given the entire CTF community copied every part of their existence off of TFC I would have assumed those servers and players would have completely disappeared when TF2/FF came out. This should have no effect on your decision. I would go one step further and say that the DM community has lost more then the CTF community to TF2/FF.<br>
<br>
Also all this same shit happened when q4 released in fact many of the same people who said they quti for Q4 and came back to HL2DM after a few weeks are the same ones playing TF2 and saying the same things now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">A new revision of Aftermath is running on my TDM server for your beta testing pleasure (only took 4 mths)<br>
A lot has been changed and fixed, smoothed out and cut off from the version you know and I’ll leave that to your jury however a few words about RPGs.<br>
…there are two RPGs on the map; when an RPG is being picked up you will see an on-screen text letting you know of a “Security breach in Area 1 or 2” as well as an alarm going off. Now. these sounds may be somewhat annoying for some..so...i've added a 'kill sounds' button in the combine control room. Simple “USE” button located inside the control booth, to your left when facing the room and exit.<br>
Let me know if its hard to find (shouldn’t be) and I’ll add a screenie.<br>
In addition, if further playtesting reveals two RPGs is a bad idea I’ll make two versions of the map one for pub one for comp.<br>
Thanks a LOT to all who dropped by, helped and advised. Jelly, nino, ninj and mamae – thanks for the bug report guys  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"><br>
This is going to run as a beta for a bit so feel free to hit me with newfound bugs, thoughts,,,....crits...bla...<br>

	<div class="content">i really, really liked the revision of this. You literally fixed every aspect of the map i hated.<br>
<br>
i do think that the text AND the sound are a bit overkill, imo you should just have 2 different sounds, that do not loop, get rid of the text, and the kill sound button all together.<br>
<br>
the map looks a bit like lockdown, the texture and the lighting in some areas give it that feel, maybe use the same sound, or a similar sound, that ld uses for the rpg trigger, and leave it up to the player who has played and studied your map to know which rpg is being breached.<br>
<br>
also, the rpg room thats in the cell, i think you should make that crawl spot to the rpg either a vent, or a small hole, like it was exploded, and idk if you did or not (didnt get that great of a look in there) put a door that doesnt open, for decoration, on one side to give the room a sense of purpose.... or if you've ever seen shashank redemption, maybe just like a crawl space between 2 buildings with a sewage pipe (lol).<br>
<br>
and the 2nd rpg should be covered a little better, maybe have its own room under there, or a barred cell, to kind of give it a reason for a sound alert to go off other than "this guy is on a pile of debris, and now he has a big fucking gun!"<br>
<br>
just some suggestions, i already like it a lot more and cant wait for its release, great job dude.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nice job I appreciate the level of effort here. You've maintained the performance well. The conversion from 3 broken walls to 1 floor near the blocked off breen-door is welcome.<br>
Pretty short rotation tho on the server! Plus it changed to r1i or something and got stuck at DL...<br>
<br>
To add to other's suggestions, minor things<br>
- the grate in the floor, you can see barrels, would it hurt gameplay to make one of those explosive<br>
- Are you set on having the charger sprite remain static?<br>
- There are windows to the "charger" room, did you ever consider opening the flap at the bottom of one?<br>
- The trigger_hurt has always been my nitpick here, I think it takes away more than it adds myself. Makes me not want to go that way.<br>
- Minor detailing, a ladder needs info_lighting by the flashing red light... It's really too bad you can't create more room at the landing of the double-wide stairs, I think you'd like it. I only figured out the floor plan of that door by spec'ing.<br>

looks like the map is pretty much working and after an update to allow bullets penetrate the RPG bar doors it seems i will release it to public. it will be called dm_aftermath_fixed<br>
<br>
next i will start the beta testing for my overwatch project. the map might also look like its in beta stages at first so bare with me...its testing the game play and FPS atm.<br>
i will be looking to finalize at least two versions of OW: a straight performance update version where nothing in the built is altered and a second version which will be an enhanced remake that will try and address the imbalances in OW (e.g. over domination of RPG spot). <br>

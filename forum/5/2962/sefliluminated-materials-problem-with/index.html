	<div class="content">While working in one of my maps I added a material to some faces just to make the contrast from dark to white, to be able to distinguish well the edges from certain brushes. Next time I played the map it wasn't fullbright anymore and the texture I applied was giving the map a good lighting. The material is dev/dev_interiorlight02b.<br>
<br>
But its too dark on some places because of the problem I came up with:<br>
Some faces were lit, and some weren't. I didn't have a light_environment so I added it. Still the same...<br>
<br>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-o2Rz3Mpjvg/SU8eGbzofhI/AAAAAAAAAr8/UCgdVD1l_QE/s1600-h/jumpbox0000.jpg" class="postlink">A pic</a><br>
<br>
What I have in the map are trigger_teleports, brushes, a door, teleport_destinations, func_details and a light_environment. That's all.<br>
<br>
I think maybe there's something missing here. Or maybe there's some option anywhere I must mess with.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Your map is no longer fullbright because vrad has detected a light source.<br>
<br>
Any texture in lights.rad will emit texture lighting - dev_interiorlight02b being one of them. This is independent of a textures selfillum setting, so not all selfillum textures cast light and vice versa.  <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Glowing_Textures" class="postlink">Some more info here</a>.<br>
<br>
Texture lighting also behaves a bit strangely when used on anything other than a world brush (ie func detail), you will see bright patches of lighting instead of a smooth lighting effect. Fun fact: changing lightmap scale on a texture light face seems to change the lights brightness.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">In short</strong>: Add light entities because even though a texture can emit light, the face itself won't actually be lit unless there is light falling on it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was hoping to be able to solve this without adding simple lights all around the map, but there's no other way. But adding all the lights isn't too painstaking, so...<br>

Lighting is a fascinating and complex realm that takes a a good while to master and then..there is the source engine on its faults and problems you HAVE tO LEARN. there's no avoiding this.<br>
Tons of information, very useful articles and tutorials are out there for you to learn pretty much everything there is to know about Source and mapping in Hammer. if you need any help just shout.<br>

	<div class="content">bottom line is this and my fellow learned mapperoonies will hopefully agree - <br>
Source (and in particular ep1 [and in particular hl2dm]) engine is a flawed piece of programming. that's a fact and everyone can see that through the numerous game bugs.<br>
what it means is you have to trial and error everything you do. and i mean everything. brushwork through lighting through entities through hinting through amount of characters in your vmf. anything can either work or it won't. depends on nothing. its just case by case. don't ask the programmer cuz they never spent a second Q&amp;Aing their code. Essentially there's a basic list of world rules or ...universe related laws in source engine for each class and then there are the real-life situations. both many times contradict.<br>
<br>
In your case - a sefl-iluminated material can work on some faces and them on others fail. regardless of its a func_detail or worldbrush. its random because its a flaw in the code.<br>
<br>
experiment experiment experiment. compile often. don't get stuck on a fixed idea of design to a point you arrive at a brick wall and have nowhere to go to. always there is something else you can do and if not - change your design (which is what happens for the most part anyway so get used to it).<br>

Those pics look alot better then the pics in the first post. To be honest with you, the first pics with the illuminated textures dont look good at all. You need to seperate them and put them on an angled brush or something. I personally dont care much for illuminated textures, but done right, they can look really really good.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yea, I agree. Those textures were just for easy recognition of the edges, as it is a jump map, and I had some ideas on how to use them better, but then I realized it also got tiredsome to see so much lights everywhere.<br>

Anyway, the map evolved into some other ideas I had in the meanwhile and its construction is following a totaly diferent path.<br>

This is one of the things I love about level design. I always have an idea of how I want something to look in my head but as soon as I set to work on it all sorts of things inspire me to try different variations and it usually ends up completely different (and much better) than I expected.<br>

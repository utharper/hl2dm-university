	<div class="content">Hi guys, here is my map, as entered into the hl2dmu mapping competition with a few changes following feedback.<br>
<br>
dm_jaeger_rc4 - <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?fzj3nt13til" class="postlink">Download Here</a><br>
<br>
It's a map based on a construction yard, the building is half-way through completion.  It's a medium sized map, and while there are separate parts of the map, these blend into eachother - there is only one enclosed space in the map (the basement).<br>
<br>
I spent alot of time assembling and editing photos for the building textures, as I wanted to create a level of realism.  The buildings were based on the city of leeds in england:<br>
<br>

<br>
I also got to use alpha blend textures for the first time, so I could blend areas of concrete floors with sandy areas without having to use two brushes.<br>
<br>

<br>
There have been 3 changes, added a staircase to cover 3 floors of the map, opening up the central part of the map:<br>

Heightened cubemaps featured in this map, allowing reflections to be seen in high detail on the building windows:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h249/nebo_01/dm_jaeger_rc10002.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Also increased lightmaps were used in the basement area to increase detail on shadows with bright lights:<br>

Whilst building the surrounding map I noticed some resemblance to a place of some significance in the town of nottingham (insert robin hood reference here).  <br>

<br>
Nottingham victoria station, now demolished and in place a shopping centre, was built in an excavated space, so I decided I would try to give the impression by creating some arches that my construction took place within a former rail station.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h249/nebo_01/dm_jaeger_rc10009.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
The third change was an addition of a break-out space for the builders, in the form of a porter cabin.  Thanks to gtamike for this suggestion.<br>

I agree. Everything looks so neat that the fence along the concrete wall looks way out of place because it's scruffy looking lol. If you made these textures, bravo. They are pretty impressive and I've not seen better textures for a building site like this. I know some of the textures and models in this map are css textures, but you should make a texture pack and release it if alot of these are yours. I know I would use them if the opportunity came. How big of a fps drop did you get when you upped the cubemap detail? I would think having all those reflections would be pretty costly. Overall, I cant complain about much here other then the lack of junk laying around.Personally, I prefer it without all the junk when it comes to actually playing on the map so no real complaints from me. Good job man.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for the comments and feedback, this is encouraging.<br>
<br>
As for the cubemap reflections, I didn't receive a hit for fps.  I guess it depends on the graphics card, some users may get a hit.  I checked by changing mat_specular 0 - is this correct?<br>
<br>
I can release the textures, no problem.  They came mostly from cgtextures.com, which I heavily modified to include cubemaps, and some to tile. I'll pack something here soon.<br>
<br>
It's clean, which is a habit of my mapping, so apologies for people looking for realism, but I wanted to keep fps high.<br>
<br>
I think one self-criticism of this map is it's low potential for tdm.  I feel the areas would be difficult to hold, maybe i'll be proved wrong i haven't playtested in tdm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Wow this is some really talented work, as expected from you. Has the level of professionalism that will impress new players from other games. First thing i was impressed with was the framerate throughout, nice job on the layout with that factor. Next was the already-noted cleanliness, I've never been on a job site so well-maintained! Not even a drop of glue or scrap of drywall to be found. You're hired ! The lighting is excellent throughout, though I'm not a fan of blinding eye-level sprites. Sound is simple and effective, that tool sound cut out midway it seemed tho. Nice use of a breakable vent too.<br>
<br>
Im unsure as to the purpose of that short set of up and down stairs. Seem in the way more than anything. I thought the wall opening above the dumpster pair could be higher to allow the continuation of the jump from above. The outside area seems like a place to avoid rather than go collect and regroup. <br>

Great mapwork, your releases are among the most polished that can be found for this game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'd beg to differ here. Though I would suggest a total weaponplacement revision. I agree with you that as it is now it is difficult to hold any area, tbh there's no reason to hold any area. For example, what would make you want to stay at a certain area? Maybe a strong weapon, a lot of health/suit, an advantage point? <br>
<br>
To your weapon layout, the ar2 for instance is a powerful tool. Now you have a couple of them out there, which makes it <br>
hard to neglect that resource for the enemy. There's no point camping it when they can get another one buy just avoiding you. Same goes with the health which is quite spread out, you could concentrate it on some points adding more 50 hp places. Maybe some more 30 suit places also. SO people want to go there/have to go there when they are hurt. <br>
<br>
With the placement of resources you can control the players, you can control tehm so some areas are worth to use or control the so they have to go there.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>haymaker wrote:</cite> The outside area seems like a place to avoid rather than go collect and regroup. </div></blockquote>

I agree in what haymaker says. If you lets say put 50 to 60 hp out there and keep the smaller amount of health packs throughout the house areas you will make people go the the outside for a quick way to get health. <br>
<br>
Maybe you put the orb away form the ar2 then you have to get the ar2 and then the balls in order to use its full potential. Plus you get a movement for teh players and you get areas to be used or to be given a higher control value. (I know you done like that, it was just an example)<br>
<br>
Now to two items I miss and you might not want but here's my view on it. The RPG and the supercharger. <br>
<br>
The charger, a quick way for health and suit. An item worth controlling and using. If you put one of those in one outside area and like 50 to 60 hp in the other you make them worth going to, worth to stay at and control. <br>
<br>
The RPG. Yeah I know it's not liked by some but, it's a weapon worth controlling. A weapon worth holding, a weapon worth using. Let's say you put a rpg in the basement. There it's not really good to use, this creates a movement. In the house maybe it's not as good either but on the top floor or on the outside areas it will be dangerous you force people to move. First to the area then from it. <br>
<br>
Put a rpg ammo for instance at the top floor where you have a crossbow and you have a nice place to guard the charger if you put one there or guard the health/ ar2 or whatever it might be worth to guard. Now you've greated a "forced" movement form down to top. YOu're controlling the players to move from one place in the map to the opposite. <br>
<br>
A map with controllable areas, but worth moving on. <br>
<br>
I love your map and I see a lot of potential on it. This is a work of art, 5 thumbs up.<br>
<br>
These are just suggestions but more for showing my point of view. I'm sure you can use the examples and think of other ways of achieving the same results if you would like to do it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Gary.  Nutri pretty much does only play competitively, prolly 1% of the time in pubs, but only to make fun of ppl. lol.  but i consider him my little brother and love him as such.  he's really a good kid, he's just.....well, nutri-grain.  <br>
and yes you are correct in saying mappers look for feedback from both pubbers and comp. players.  i know valar likes to have both style players in his play tests.  with that said, there really are maps that dont work for pubbing and vice versa,  i think that's all grain was saying, and a lot of mappers when making a map concentrate on one aspect. i do come to your servers a lot, for the exact reason you stated, to play in a relaxed, fun atmosphere.  BUT there are sometimes when i look at the server browser and see that you have 14 ppl playing in bio, i dont want to join.  which is totally fine, im not saying thats wrong, to each their own.  the point im trying to make, as i said b4, some maps dont work for pubbing and some dont work for comp.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol, no he prolly did intend to insinuate that.  ya, you guys have maps ive never heard of month after month.   i think the comp. player adjusting to the pubs is more than the map, its the style of play as well.  ive pretty much abandoned comp. style for now, burnt out on it.  im starting to adjust to the pub style.  it can be fun as well, its just hard to get that competitive mindset out of my head, and just relax and have fun.  i have really 2 styles of pub i like.  the HCC/EYE servers where i turn down the ingame volume to about 1/4 and jam to music, or i come to the FF servers and shoot the shit and have fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Jake: Yes, you are correct in your assumptions, I am trying to make a map for comp.  I've map lots of pub maps in the past (dm_council_tsgk, dm_freerunner, dm_sadists_pit) and imo pub maps are easier to make because you only have to have reasonable skills in weapon placement.  The challenge comes in comp maps when weapon placement can make or break a map, that is why leagues still play maps like lockdown and caverns because they are very good for comp. <br>
<br>
So in all this is still a work in progress and a learning curve for me, never tried to map comp before so I appreciate all the feedback, I just need time to absorb it and develop my weapon placing skills for comp.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You could make a map called dm_shitville_9000 and put mounds of shit everywhere while scattering weapons around in no distinct pattern and still have people in there going "I LIKE THIS MAP <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">:D ITS NEWWWWWWWWWW!"  All I was saying is that jaeger rc1 didn't play well in scrims/competative play AT ALL.  I usually wouldn't care, but we're using jaeger in the hl2dm:u 2v2 cup, and playing rc1 in the cup would be disasterous.  That being said, rc2 is an improvement in the competative aspect.  There is more hp, and a litttttttttttttle change in weapon placement, but there are still lots of terrible/stupid things about the map:<br>
<br>
- the random props that do nothing but take up space and allow players to trip over (i understand these were put in here for realism...but come on)<br>
- lol, a bicycle<br>
- weapon placement is still pretty shitty <br>
   - there are slams...<br>
   - the smg nades and speed balls all seem to be grouped into one or two piles making it easy for players to go from 0 spam to full spam in a matter of seconds<br>
   - the rpg is WAY too easy to get.  you literally run past it with ur grav gun on secondary and you get it. then once you have it, anyone outdoors is fucked<br>
   - you can't walk into the rpg cage thing...but you can grav stuff through it?  what is the point of that?<br>
   - i would also suggest moving the rpg to an area where you can't automatically use it - ex:  the basement.  if you get the rpg down there (and you have a sound or   something alerting other players, and you make it take longer than 0.0000001 seconds to get) it will cause the person with the rpg to move out of the basement to use it efficiently, and while this person is getting it, they'd be open to close quarters spam and such.<br>
- remove all the dumb little hiding places around the map (especially in the basement).  you can go under the stair cases, you can go into little corners by the shelves, you can get behind some of those big ass generators, etc...<br>
- remove some things in the map that have no purpose other than to create a sense of "realism."  ex:  that little stair case thing that goes up and down in 2 seconds and is just placed in the middle of a floor.  ex2: that crane that is propped up against the wall.<br>
<br>
I suggest you look at a few other competative maps and get some ideas from them.  take caverns for example:  caverns is perfectly laid out so that one side has one set of weapons (xbox, mag) and the other has a different set (ar2 + speed balls).  then there are places around the map for the other weapons (shotgun on both the mag side and the ar2 side, and between both sides), and smg nades strategically placed around the map.  this type of weapon placement causes players to move around the map instead of getting all the weapons you need and camping.  now some people choose to camp on caverns, but when they do they are at a disadvantage, because now they don't have the other weapons that are in the map.  EX:  if a team decides to camp back mag in caverns, they are provided with mag, shottie, bow, and an smg nade, but they are allowing the other players to stock up on ar2 and speed balls.  which will lead to a ball fest in back mag, driving the campers out.<br>
<br>
from what i've seen in jaeger, the basement is the place to be for most teams.  you get the ar2 and rpg, and then on your way down to the basement you get speed balls and smg nades.  this can all be done in about 20-30 seconds and then once you're in the basement...that's it.  all you have to do now is stay in those little hiding places and spam balls and smg nades at anyone trying to come in.  A map like jaeger has very high potential to be a map where players are constantly moving, and the action is constantly fast-paced, but without better weapon placement, and some minor tweaks, this map will become just another camper's dream. AKA: a boring map.</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">i only played rc1 the one time.  no rpg, iirc.  it turned into an orb fest.  a team could camp/hold the basement with the ar and have easy access to the 2 orbs at the top of the stairs in the bicycle atrium.  in fact, i didnt even know there were 2 orbs in that location they were so efficiently snatched up.<br>
<br>
rc2 i've played several times now and its an rpg fest.  it seemed relatively easy to gain control of the rpg area.  one with rpg camps the slow lift end (GREAT field of view into 3 transition area's) while the other camps the opposite end with a mag.  its difficult to defeat that strat with the 4 health packs and 4 batteries right there handy.  an opponent can get off a decent mag shot only to have the guy with the rpg stumble backwards over the health to recover while blowing your ass sky high.  the openess of the rpg area also makes the shotty and orbs inefficient for trying to take control away.  i'm not saying that necessarily makes the map bad... just makes it and rpg control map like LV or Zeta.<br>
<br>
if you decide to keep the rpg where it is, i would remove the 4 hp's and 4 batteries from the rpg area... or at least remove 2 of each.  there needs to be more risk for the rpg, or encouragement to take the rpg out of the area to hunt.  i would also swap the mag in the rpg area and the crossbow at the suit charger.  the crossbow has a slower shot time than the mag.  i dont think the mag up top is much of a concern.  that area with the suit charger is easily attacked with nades and rpg.<br>
<br>
the idea of the rpg in the basement is also not bad.  but i'd put all ar's and orbs futher from reach above the basement level.  if a team gets rpg and an endless supply of orbs in the basement... game over.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi guys,<br>
<br>
Save another release, I've posted what is currently the rc3.  I've noted the feedback, which has been very helpful.  Note the layout shot for the weapons layout.  There are now 2 orbs, one in each corner of the map.  2 SMG Grenades placed individually as well.  The AR2 is above ground as suggested.  Crossbow and Mag are swapped as suggested.  RPG is now inside a fence, entry only by vent, cannot be phys-grabbed from outside the fence.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h249/nebo_01/dm_jaeger_rc30000.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Basement area has been redone to be more spacious, less opportunity to camp, no AR2, crossbow has replaced this.  And RPG is accessible only by ladder upto fenced area (see above shot).<br>

<br>
Fenced area (previously housing the RPG in rc2) has been redone.  Field of view is now not as good, so less camping there.<br>

Yes, I did.  But, really what is the problem with the staircase? It was in a corner, out the way of anybody tripping over it. It just feels really pedantic. The staircase provides aesthetic in a low detail area of the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Some updates to Jaeger.<br>
<br>
11 x Healthkit<br>
10 x Battery<br>
<br>
Due to feedback the map sorely needed more health and batteries.<br>
<br>
2 x 357<br>
2 x Ar2<br>
3 x Crossbow<br>
3 x Shotgun<br>
1 x RPG (accessed through vent - 5 seconds)<br>
10 x Frag Grenade<br>
<br>
Healthkits and batteries positioned outside the building along with AR2, Crossbow, Shotgun and various ammo kits.<br>
<br>
357s and Crossbow inside and nearby the building.<br>
<br>
Inside the building are the mag and crossbow, but the team have to keep moving out the building to get access to healthkits.  Team not occupying the building have the advantage of having better access to healthkits and batteries and AR2, but will have to get inside the building to access the 357.<br>
<br>
Sound good? Maybe more weapons needed as well?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

nice.  I just got a chance to hop around the latest revision and I like it a lot.  I like how you hollowed out the rpg spawn and created the open path to where the shotty would be next to the little elevator.  Seems more balanced now with less smg nades and spawns but I'm still trying to get used to it not having as many like in rc2.  Does seem like its missing alot of ammo and weapons but I guess everything is more spread out and strategic.<br>
<br>
All in all its getting betta and betta lol.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"><br>
<br>
as a side note:  I really like rc2 version for pub play.  I wouldn't scrap that version.  Every version tho, looks beautiful and refreshing.  Its got this kinda sheen to it like Mirror's Edge or something.  Nice work mate.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

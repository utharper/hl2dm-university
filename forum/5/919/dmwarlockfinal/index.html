	<div class="content">I will (hopefully) be posting a newer and updated version later on this evening and would be cool to get your inputs again on the updated version. <br>
Changes you should expect to see are: <br>
<br>
1. S-shaped staircase is now twice as wide and much smoother  this was the maps main choke-point. <br>
2. Underground watery tunnel removed <br>
3. Jumping using the lifts you can now reach greater height without bumping head in ceiling <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised">) <br>
4. Due to popular demand - added a few overhead openings in high walls enabling throwing physics, nades and direct RPGs from one area to another (lostvilage style..) <br>
5. Hill area now wider and added with a new passage connecting it with the S-shaped stairs area. <br>
6. Removed wooden door room near S-shaped stairs <br>
7. Smoothed out the curved broken wall near the S-shaped stairs making it possible to climb on. <br>
8. Stairs opposing the Suitcharger room are now twice as wide <br>
9. A grated crevice in the floor between the RPG area and the Suitcharger room had water in it..water are now removed now and replaced with a bit of grass for performance reasons. <br>
10. SMG nades have been decreased from 12 to 7 <br>
11. Added more xbow and shotgun pickups <br>
12. Added a map Soundscape <br>
13. This version will be testing a possible fix for lift sounds not playing on Linux <br>
14. Add a few Sawblades (Still in testing as Im not so sure the pros it offers are worth the cons for player movements). <br>
<br>
thanks to all who dropped in and played / offered their input. much appreciated!<br>

If you'd rather use it as a TDM map I think you should remove some weapons. Right now it is too easy to get a good one, making attempts to control certain parts of the map more or less meaningless.<br>

Actually, when I think about it, I would suggest removing a few weapons even for ffa play. I think it could enhance the way certain areas of the map becomes more interesting than others. Haven't played it enough to have any specific suggestions though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

NOTE: there is a source bug in both versions of warlock which basically let's you physjump on top of the center building. this bug has been somewhat reduced in 'tdm' but i think it may still occur. in any case, if i get complaints it's an actual problem i will further investigate (playerclip doesn't seem to do the job lol...there's Source for ya...).<br>

how can i tell between the two maps? 1) the TDM ver has TDM prefix and the DM ver has DM prefix. 2) the TDM ver has a tower the DM doesn't.<br>

<br>
I think Octagon and Warlock are both great maps and they do have a different style of play and feel than most of the maps we currently have.  I think both would be fine to play matches on.  <br>
<br>
I do see Fearsomes point about remakes and maps ripped from other games.  We want to see new maps for DM, not rehashed Quake, Halo or UT3 maps.  That said tho, I don't see why reason why we can't use totally new maps that have textures like Octagon or something else completely different from the same old HL textures and designs (how many prison maps do we really need?) that we have always had.  Valar has been designing maps like crazy lately (a ton of maps on the last few months alone) with the thought of bringing a slightly different feel to maps than what we have had.  Its true though it seems that this different style is being rejected and maybe it shouldn't be. <br>
<br>
It is a shame that people are not more open minded to new things.  They resist any new maps and chose to go back to the same old same old because its familiar or they are too lazy to learn a new map.  These are often the same people that complain about the current maps.  Its a no win situation.</div></blockquote>

was thinking ..would there be a need for a CAL version for tdm_warlock? if this is something people are interested in please let know what changes / tweaks you feel are needed and i'll follow up.<br>

mm..i honestly don't see how the hallway in warlock is an issue? its a two people hallway and this fact has been not only addressed in your post para but also in many other places...this is not a problem in any way. please correct me.<br>
<br>
as for another weapon down that hall...what weapon did you have in mind para?<br>
<br>
as for shadows...im not sure how this comes into play AT ALL while ingame,. i don't see how you can have enough time to see a shadow and run get that person...pretty long run in to showrt-a-time?...plus the shadow doesn't tell you if its a clanmate or not ...meh..<br>
ill see if i can do something about it nonetheless. just stating my view - i think its weird that this is an issue.<br>
<br>
props? too few? thought?<br>

para,<br>
as i noted elsewhere...there is one hall that's 2 players-wide in warlock not more. i keep hearing reference to plural and am lost.<br>
as for weapons: u got 1 mag, 2 shotties and 3 xbow in warlock currently.<br>
1 mag creates one control point. more mag will open the gameplay and change it...not saying the change will be bad...just pointing it out.<br>

	<div class="content">More skilled players do not like long or very narrow halls. I can think of 2 in the map on the second level where basically if a crossbow comes down the middle you will get hit no matter what. This is why skilled players dont like it, because no matter how good they move they will most likely get hit so they feel like they cannot be aggressive and attack from those areas. The same is true for not so tight but long halls where if the other guy is good you are going to get hit with a mag. Also small doors  that you come out of have the same effect you are affraid to come out and fight cause you know when you pass through you have a high chance of getting killed. <br>
<br>
As for props. I felt it needed more variety, seemed like mostly saw blades which are hard to see and not so often caught and barrels. Some sculptures probably would be good or other things that would go with the map theme. <br>
<br>
I hated the rocket in the map made little sense and was easy to get if you knew it was there. It was just some random cubby up top. I think taking that same area and making it like a bowl shape up top where you have to throw a grenade in and the rocket gets blasted out in any direction would be a good way to set it up. Then you have some searching for it, and something a little unique. <br>
<br>
On that same note open up the top of the map so we can spam stuff over walls to get kills. That would give the map more options for play especially if someone is camping an area. <br>
<br>
I also felt the weapons were light and would have liked to see it closer to the dm version with more weapons. '<br>
<br>
No mines please. Cant even remember if there are any in tdm version though. <br>
<br>
The last thing was the architecture would have been a little better if some how in some middle area there was 3 levels of play instead of just 2 as in most. give the map more vertical play and create another way to add connections. <br>
<br>
Overall I felt this map was a big improvement over aftermath definitely moving faster in the right direction but some of the same core issues while not as bad stayed like the long narrow halls. <br>
<br>
The important thing is just to keep you mind open some times or many times players have a hard time communicating to mappers what they want or why. Ask most players why they like a certain map and completely ambiguous answers will come back with no bias. Such as its well balanced or it flows well. What the heck does that mean or how the heck do I put that in my map? What drives a persons map choice although it always seems unbias is usually bias people like aim arena cause they have a good mag and since the map has 1 at practically every spawn they dont have to work to get it. At least here you get a good feel that making 2 person wide hallways 4 or 6 person wide halls might help.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

done until now most of the brushwork changes and weapons.<br>
still a few narrow point and props left to do...<br>
<br>
would like to get ppl's thoughts on the changes..<br>
<br>
notes:<br>
<br>
i don't see how adding a third floor is applicable in this map<br>
I have playerclipped the whole map's top. it took care of the "nodraw-hackview" problem but it also brings us back to point #1 - low ceiling and the complaints this map got for it in the beginning. so we'll see how this goes down with playtesters this time.<br>

Actually Valar, I was thinking about it on my drive to work and I might have a couple of suggestions regarding some of the new xbows and shottys being moved or switched and I think you can get rid of some maybe.  I will look through it again later.   <br>

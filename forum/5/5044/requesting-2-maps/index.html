As for the first map, just grab a friend, load up a map with a supercharger and all weapons (eg. ld), tell him to sit where u want, move as u want and, well, shoot first, ask questions later lol I used to do this for shotty practice when I wanted to train my shotty to do more than 100, even 200..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yep. <br>

It shouldn't be that hard to make a sign displaying damage, amirite? Just create an entity with 9999999 health and then tie the difference between max health an current health to a variable that displays on a sign?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The problem with that map is twofold. First, no player ever in competitive play is going to be falling from 300 feet. We don't have competitive maps like that. Second, the rate of speed at which those barrels are traveling, and the distance they are from you, means you have to lead fire way more than you would have to if you were fighting a person from a reasonable distance. In essence, that map trains you to shoot BADLY for competitive play. Maybe its nice for killbox training or something, but its entirely worthless and even counterproductive for what I'm talking about.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Noes. The only entity I can think of that passes it's health value is func_breakable, and the value is a normalised percentage of it's max health. Remapping this back to an integer with a math_remap would give you very inaccurate results.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the logic of how to display an integer / float value on a screen... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">That's why I said that they could and SHOULD be modified, specially the predicting part in all those maps! omg Ofc the dimensions are too big, even for kbx and maybe a barrel isn't even a good replacement for a player body. But it's a start, a layout. As for the first map, plugins can say on the screen how much damage an enemy/npc takes, but not an object. Also how can a simple object teach you to aim for the head, where some weapons do 3xdamage? How will that be calculated, if the results in the first place are inaccurate, as boshed said? I'm on your side here, don't get me wrong. I'm only coming up with solutions, either you take them or someone else will, but no need for such quick dismissions, just more/better solutions..<br>
<br>
EDIT: tbr_bluepuzzle has some player controlled cannons that throw exploding melons, maybe those can be modified to throw exploding barrels</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

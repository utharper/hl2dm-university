<br>
I get the error below:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">"Error writing C:\Users\Javier\Desktop\propdata.txt <br>
(Error: Unexpected end of GCF stream (0 B of 12187 B). <br>

<br>
Which is consistent with the <strong class="text-strong">pale look</strong> (like greyed out) of every file inside that gcf.<br>
<img src="http://z7qbsg.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pX_KsDvhX59TQ0q-RFaYN3S46K8s5bLRhic9siKDaTwqGIbAnHEHFplSe45WEUHWu33PrAwV1G8RUVzENNRfxyPfwto7eE0tI/errorextracting.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>

That is also consistent with the <strong class="text-strong">unfinished progress bar</strong> below too:<br>

<br>
Every time I have opened that gcf I have closed Steam first just in case.<br>
What do you think?<br>
<br>
I have already deleted this gcf file to get Steam to download it, at least 3 times. So this is not helping. In fact I erased HL2DM from that Steam Games window, from the My Games tab, right-clicked on it and chose "Delete Local Content...", and redownloaded it again. <br>
<br>
I'll appreciate any feedback, thanks a bunch.<br>

Which would explain why HL2DM can't find all these definitions. <br>
The thing is, I don't know for a fact that the "half-life 2 deathmatch.gcf" file is supposed to have a propdata.txt file. <br>
Could you (or anyone) check on this please?<br>
For those that don't know:<br>
You can check this using a program like <a href="http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=26" class="postlink">GCFScape</a> or <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/Crafty.shtml" class="postlink">Crafty</a><br>
<br>
The GCF (Game Cache File) files are found here: C:\Program Files\steamapps\<br>
There find a file called: "half-life 2 deathmatch.gcf". Double click it. Once open, use Ctrl-f to search using the word: propdata.txt<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for trying,<br>
<br>
Btw, I finally succeeded extracting the propdata.txt file from the "source engine.gcf" file! I think what helped was doing a <strong class="text-strong">verification of the game cache integrity</strong>, as explained <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335" class="postlink">here</a>. After I did that, I opened the source engine.gcf file and all its files inside no longer looked greyed out.<br>

Ah I see, I assumed you would have already tried validating as thats usually the first thing to try when files go wrong. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
<br>
HL2DM doesn't have its own propdata.txt in it's GCF, it uses the generic one. That doesn't appear to be the one in source engine.gcf as I haven't updated HL2 in months so the files in there are greyed out for me also - but my hl2dm works fine.<br>
<br>
I suspect it uses the one in base source engine 2.gcf<br>
<br>
Also double check you don't have a propdata.txt in your /hl2mp/scripts/ folder as that will override one from the GCF.<br>
<br>
What do you need the propdata.txt for?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi Boshed, I'm glad you haven't given up on me <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
I checked every gcf file and I only found propdata.txt files in the following GCFs:<br>
<br>
- source 2007 binaries.gcf<br>
- episode two content.gcf<br>
- base source engine 2.gcf<br>
- source engine.gcf<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I suspect it uses the one in base source engine 2.gcf</div></blockquote>
Well, I checked all the prop definitions that "<strong class="text-strong">according to the HL2DM console</strong>" were not found in the propdata.txt file (it doesn't say which one though). These materials were:<br>
Metal, glass, Cardboard, plastic, wooden, and stone.<br>
<br>
Here's a strange thing... <br>
This is what I found: Metal and glass <strong class="text-strong">exist</strong> in all the GCFs list above. This suggests that HL2DM is not using the propdata.txt files from those GCFs. Which one then? This is why I had thought that my half-life 2 deathmatch.gcf file was missing its own.<br>
And, these materials WERE NOT found: Cardboard, plastic, wooden, stone.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also double check you don't have a propdata.txt in your /hl2mp/scripts/ folder as that will override one from the GCF.</div></blockquote>
Oh! I am so glad you suggested this! <br>
I found that there was one indeed! WITH NOTHING IN IT!!! No wonder!<br>
Ok, so now I just erased it, and ran HL2DM. SUCCESS!!! YES!! I no longer get those console messages saying it couldn't find blah blah blah... <br>
The funny thing is now, there is no propdata.txt file in the "half-life 2 deathmatch.gcf" file, neither it is in the /hl2mp/scripts/ folder. Then, where is it reading the definitions for materials like Cardboard, plastic, wooden, and stone? <br>
Well now that things are working as they should, this question is not as important, but I wouldn't mind knowing.<br>
<br>
Thank you kindly Boshed for your help and patience <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

So that leaves us with the one in base source engine 2.gcf<br>
<br>
I've just extracted it and compared it to the <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Prop_data_base_types" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline">default list</span></a> and it corresponds perfectly, so I'm almost certain that's where HL2DM gets its prop info from.<br>
<br>
You were getting missing propdata because your empty /hl2mp/scripts/propdata.txt was overriding the one from that gcf. If I'm not mistaken it works like this:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">local filesystem</strong> &gt;overrides&gt; <strong class="text-strong">content packed into the map.bsp</strong> &gt;overrides&gt; <strong class="text-strong">content in the game's gcf</strong> (if it has one) &gt;overrides&gt; <strong class="text-strong">content from the base source gcf</strong><br>
<br>
There are a few exceptions (soundscapes being one that springs to mind, and sv_pure disallowing local filesystem content being another) but that seems to be the general rule.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

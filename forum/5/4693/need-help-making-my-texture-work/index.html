<br>
I wonder if someone would bother checking my files up and help me find where the problem is?<br>
<br>
Here are the files:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><a href="http://snipurl.com/custom_props" class="postlink">custom_props</a></strong> Textures - Put'em in the Materials folder.<br>
This image shows an explanation of what you'll find in the custom props.zip file<br>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><a href="http://snipurl.com/modelsrc" class="postlink">modelsrc files</a></strong> All source files - Put'em in the models/modelsrc folder<br>
<br>
So, if you can make it work, then I'll know the problem is not with the files I'm using. Any insight on what could I be doing wrong would be super.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance guys <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

Why not make a small map (a dev room) put the model and a info_player_start in there, pakrat it then upload the bsp?<br>

you'd get more input that way.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for letting me know about the "dud" PP <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
I just fixed it.<br>
<br>
The reason why I'm not creating a BSP with it is because everytime I attempt to open the SDK Tool it keeps saying:<br>
"This game is currently unavailable. Please try again at another time." <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
It happened since last night.<br>
I am able to open HL2DM and join a game, but I can't open the SDK Tool.<br>
I am not too worried about this now, I'll find the solution eventually. <br>
<br>
For now I want to get this "missing material issue" resolved as soon as possible. But I could use a helping hand.<br>
<br>
I don't know if this has anything to do with it but I've noticed that the VMT file made by StudioCompiler has the 2 types of slashes in the same path address:<br>
<br>
"LightmappedGeneric"<br>
{<br>
	"$baseTexture" "models<strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">\</span></strong>custom_models<strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">/</span></strong>drpeppercan"<br>
}<br>
<br>
I have changed the second one to be like the first, but my model still doesn't show the material in ModelViewer <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
I just thought we couldn't have both slashes in the same path... anyway.<br>

	<div class="content">Ok I figured if I make this more accessible maybe people will help <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
This is what I'm getting presently:<br>
The model loads, but without its texture <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
<img src="http://snipurl.com/mdlvwrmissngtxtr" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Now, this is where GUIStudioMDL places all the files it creates from the modelsrc folder (which is available to you <a href="http://snipurl.com/modelsrc" class="postlink">here</a>). Ignore the "burger" files please.<br>
<img src="http://snipurl.com/modelfileslocations" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
And finally, this is where the textures are located:<br>
<img src="http://snipurl.com/textureslocations" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
I don't suppose there is any point in going through the steps I take to make/export/compile the model as we can see it just fine in Model Viewer. Clearly the only thing missing is the texture. As for how I do it, I make sure its dimensions are by the power of 2 (1024x1024), TGA format. I have used both VTFEdit and Studio Compiler to create it. I have created the VMT from other scripts and have let both previously mentioned applications create the VMT for me. <br>
This is what my VMT presently looks like:<br>
<br>
"LightmappedGeneric"<br>
{<br>
	"$baseTexture" "models/custom_models/drpeppercan"<br>
}<br>
<br>
I don't know what else to mention for now. Should you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.<br>
<br>
Thanks guys,<br>

	<div class="content">Actually, not stupid at all Paradox ; ) We might be up to something here!<br>
It just so happens that: <br>
1. I don't have a <strong class="text-strong">materialsrc</strong> folder (I'm just putting the TGA file along with the rest of the model source files, the SMDs, in the modelsrc folder).<br>
2. I don't have a VMF file either. Only the VMT &amp; VTF. The latter one I create it by dragging the TGA into Source Compiler, then I move the resulting VTF to the materials/models/custom_props folder where I already have the VMT I created earlier by hand (most of the time).<br>
<br>
I guess it would make more sense to have a materialsrc folder too eh? <br>
<br>
Anything you have spotted already?<br>

As I replied to him:<br>
"Both changing to VLG (as opposed to LMG) and correcting my QC file helped already (the folder was called "custom_models", but in the QC file I had entered "custom_props")."<br>
<br>
Btw, while creating my test room with Hammer I realized what the VMF file is ; ) So now I have one. I just don't see what this file has to do with my texture...<br>

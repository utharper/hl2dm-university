The following maps have been tried and tested for over three months now and have received excellent feedback (and server filling up when some of them are on says something).  The concept behind those maps (who are ALL remakes):<br>
<br>
1. No weapon rooms; if they are present they are removed.<br>
2. Reduced size; unnecessary stuff and textures are removed or changed.<br>
3. Easy on the eye; bright or dark maps are adjusted for visual comfort and clarity.<br>
4. Camping spots removed; especially in the bunker where the entire underground tunnel network was deleted.<br>
5. Texture overlap and leakage fixed.<br>
6. 12 spawn points on all maps.<br>
7. Even distribution of weapons and effective weapons close to spawn points.<br>
8. Generally rpg free, but depends on map.<br>
<br>
The basic rule: <span style="color:#800000"><strong class="text-strong">intense action</strong></span>.  That being said, these are the links:<br>

	<div class="content">I've just had a look at the non-killbox maps briefly, and although a seemingly good initiative I've got a few things to comment on.<br>
<br>
I think you should've named the maps with eleastyle as a suffix, e.g. dm_frenzy_eleastyle, following the recommended naming scheme of HL2DMU.<br>
<br>
Generally, they're too bland. Some more contrast between different structures would probably help with both visual orientation as well as avoiding boredom. <br>
<br>
Calling the rpg a noob weapon only shows your own lack of understanding of that weapon. I agree that it can dominate maps if placed in the wrong places, but that just goes to show that the map maker was a noob in this department.<br>
<br>
I'm not entirely comfortable with you placing the ELEA logo in maps by other authors unless you've asked them for permission.<br>
<br>
dm_eleastyle_octagon isn't an octagon remake, but a remake of octagon_v2, which is an arena-style, octagon-shaped map. Popular in the US I believe.<br>
<br>
dm_thumper without a thumper feels a little silly, but apart from that, was it really making that much of an impact on fps or gameplay? I've got a 4 year old computer and never really had any problems with frame rates on any of these maps.<br>
<br>
Sorry for coming off so negative in general. If you feel these are right for you, and seem popular on your servers, who am I to argue. And as I haven't played any of them yet, I can't really compare with the gameplay of the originals.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Reason for this was to organize the map selector in mani.  Now all those maps come together instead of being scattered around,  Used the other way first and then decided to change the order.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Cynips wrote:</cite>Generally, they're too bland. Some more contrast between different structures would probably help with both visual orientation as well as avoiding boredom. </div></blockquote>

Have been thinking about that.  They are kinda monotonous, but I'm not a big fan of textures.  The more the worse as far as I'm concerned.  Exceptions are obviously maps like Warlock that are absolutely stunning and WAY beyond my ability.<br>

Let me clarify - it's a noob weapon in low gravity snipe maps (was referring to our ELEA 2 server where people camp and rpg others to death and beyond).  Fighters there usually have a KD well above 6 and then drop to 0.3 (if lucky) on other servers.  RPG is not a noob weapon when used by players who can also use other weapons and move.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Cynips wrote:</cite>I'm not entirely comfortable with you placing the ELEA logo in maps by other authors unless you've asked them for permission.</div></blockquote>

Absolutely correct.  I do have permissions from many but not all.  I have no real way of knowing WHO made what map as creator info isn't embedded in the vmf.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Cynips wrote:</cite>dm_eleastyle_octagon isn't an octagon remake, but a remake of octagon_v2, which is an arena-style, octagon-shaped map. Popular in the US I believe.</div></blockquote>

Right, there are two different octagons.  Then again, there are two Budweisers.<br>

Reason I kept the thumper name is to name the map original.<br>

Well, only a handful are in rotation.  The most popular is the remake of dm_magnum as shotguns were added for more blasting entertainment.<br>
<br>
Excellent comments and good for future reference.  Mucho grazzi.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Totally get your drift and am doing something about it right now; got Hammer loaded up and ready to fire.<br>

There areTWO rpgs on 7-hour?  I just remove rpgs that are easy to get to, make it noob safe.  If they can't fight and move skillfully, they're not getting an rpg to help'em along.  dm_elea_aim has an rpg that is perfectly noob safe in an aim_arena type of way; I can barely get it.<br>

Don't tell me you believe the Euro Bud and US Bud is the same beer?  Euro Bud (Czech?) is beer, while US Bud is like making love on the beach - 2 fkn close to water.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Original 7hour has two rpg's, yes. None of them particularly difficult to get.<br>
<br>
The rpg on dm_elea_aim is relatively difficult to get by jumping, but anyone decent at grav nading can get it without much sweat.<br>
<br>
With "one beer" I was referring to the fact that I don't really consider the US Bud to be beer but rather water, as you rightfully point out <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">HL2DMU is proud to present a community initiated map contest for HL2DM...</strong><br>
<br>
<span style="color:red">NOTE: Please check these forums regularly for updates on the contest. Although first prize if fixed and we will do our best to leave things as is, rules and consolation prizes are subject to change at any time.</span><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">RULES</strong><br>
<br>
1. Map must be an original work and completed to prefinal level. Map must be previously unreleased and must remain so for the duration of competition. Mapmaker must agree to allow HL2DMU to release their map as part of the winning trio mappack before promoting it publicly.<br>
<br>
2. Mapper must submit .vmf, .bsp, and final compile log for review. Email a link to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7a4bea3b2b6b3babeb997bfbbe5b3bafaa2b9bea1b2a5a4bea3aef9b4b8ba"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="25564c51404441484c4b654d4917414808504b4c534057564c515c0b464a48">[emailÂ protected]</span></a>. Please do not email the files, just provide a URL (filefront etc). You should receive a confirmation email. If you do not, please post on the forums and arrange an alternative method of submission. You are also welcome to submit as much information about the design of your map as you see fit if you think it will help the judges understand the motivation behind your design and the gameplay it was designed to encourage.<br>
<br>
3. Deadline for map submission is October 11th 2007. Maps received after this date will not be considered.<br>
<br>
4. HL2DMU Officials will vote on the final 8 maps and winners.<br>
<br>
6. Any HL2DMU Official wanting to participate must opt out of all judging responsibilities.<br>
<br>
7. Map must be made specifically for standard HL2DM by Valve. It must not be made for a mod based on HL2DM, nor should it be a capture the flag, nokill, or co-op style map (or any other non-standard deathmatch style of play). While team spawns are permitted, they are not recommended.<br>
<br>
8. Map must run on windows and linux servers. If you do not have a linux server to test on, submit your map anyway and HL2DMU will try to assist you with any bugs that cause linux crashes during the testing and judging stage.<br>
<br>
9. Map must be fully packed. The only other files that may be included with the .vmf and .bsp are a readme.txt and a .res file that points to it.<br>
<br>
10. LDR lightmaps are required. Maps that are fullbright or have HDR lightmaps only will not be considered.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">PRIZES</strong><br>
<br>
1. $150.00 US for first place. Winner will be required to provide information necessary to receive the funds (name and address for cashiers check, or a paypal account). Consolation prizes may be announced prior to the deadline, but are not confirmed at this time.<br>
<br>
2. The top 3 mappers will have the opportunity to work with HL2DMU Officials to tweak and finetune their maps on a technical and gameplay level through extensive testing and bug checking. Upon completion to final level, all three maps will be included in a special community map pack.<br>
<br>
3. Winning map will run in the cycle on as many public servers as we can get to support the contest.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
GUIDELINES</strong><br>
<br>
1. The theme for this contest is competitive team strategy.<br>
<br>
2. HL2DMU Offials will review and discuss the following aspects of the map:<br>
<br>
a. Technical soundness, including FPS performance and reasonable file size given the nature of the map.<br>
b. Gameplay, layout, connectivity, control points and flow.<br>
c. Visual appeal.<br>
d. Balance.<br>
e. Overall appeal and fun factor.<br>
<br>
3. Try to make every area of your map count, such as connecting you to another area of the map, being a good area to hold, or storing a useful pickup. An example of something that "doesnt count": a deadend at the back of your map with pistol ammo in it.<br>
<br>
4. Map size will also factor into the voting. The map should be big enough to support teamplay for 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 competition, but not so big that the players have to run around for a while just looking for each other.<br>

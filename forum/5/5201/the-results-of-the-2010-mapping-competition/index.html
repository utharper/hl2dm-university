	<div class="content"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">First Place goes to dm_asylum by Valar. </span><br>
<br>
Asylum is a beautiful, large map with great weapon balance. When playing it, we felt that it was polished, smooth, and had the perfect blend of close and open combat. We're getting together with Valar to improve several areas of the map and then it will be released for the public.<br>
<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Second Place goes to dm_voltage by FENIX.</span><br>
<br>
Voltage is a smaller map suitable for 1v1 and 2v2 play. The centerpiece of the map is an RPG enclosed in a room that periodically explodes. This map element prevents the RPG from being the map's only useful weapon. We're getting together with FENIX to improve several areas of the map and then it will be released for the public.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Third Place goes to dm_gladius by Brunt.</span><br>
<br>
Gladius is a perfect pub map. It is not only beautiful, but the spawns and weapon placement are nearly impeccable. Gladius features a caged RPG in the basement that plays roman horns when taken, and a lion head fountain functions as the map's one super charger. Brunt plans to further refine some textures of the map before releasing it. <br>
<br>

<br>
The two runners-up are Chickenmobile with dm_ssorg and Dallas with dm_metalbase. Both of these maps were strong competitors, but just barely didn't make the cut. We're all looking forward to playing on these when they are publicly released. <br>
<br>
Again, congratulations to our winners and a big thank-you to everyone who entered. This was a hard contest to judge and we're very pleased to start putting these maps in rotation.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Congratulations you guys, especially anhk AKA Valar. Very nice map....<br>
<br>
I really liked both voltage and Gladius. In fact tbh I loved gladius, it has alot of potential brunt to be one of the best pub maps ever made. I will gather up some advice for you. <br>
<br>
$50 to anhk<br>
<br>
$35 to Fenix and his partner<br>
<br>
$15 to brunt<br>
<br>
PM me your paypals please, I will send out the money by the end of the week, probably by Thursday. I have worked out a way to send USD to Russia so no problems there. A big thank you from myself to all you guys personally. <br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. Coax has not been finished yet, as boshed has went missing. Sorry we couldnt judge that map, but hopefully it will get done soon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">congrats Val.  knowing your attention to detail i had to wonder what you were going for with the latin.  seeing as how you used an alias im guessing you were trying to say something like;<br>
<br>
you wanted to see if you could get the top vote thru hard work not because of your name. because if you used your real name nobody would vote against you.  <br>
<br>
well, as i told you a long time ago, your work speaks for itself.  BUT im glad you finally got some reward for it.  i told Valiums i was going to donate something for the winner, but i never got around to telling him what it was.  i was thinking about what i wanted to do yesterday.  my donation is any steam game under $50 you would like.  you name it and ill gift it to you my brother.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks to Conflict and nArchy for their time and inputs during development. These two are priceless.<br>
Big ups to Fenix (поздравления) and Brunt (Love your work m8 you know this! You just keep on going up a notch with ever new map)<br>
Thanks chem. that's very cool of you brother.  but um, my head is so up Valve's a$$ i'm afraid i don't really know other games...i could use some suggestions / recommendations tho <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
To conclude, and i'm not being sarcastic when i say i hope dm_asylum compensates for the sheer crap dm_aftermath was.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>

	<div class="content">These look fantastic guys! Can't wait to play them. Great job Valar, you never cease to amaze everyone with your creativity and map beauty. <br>
<br>
I can't help feeling that dm_voltage is somewhat familiar -  it has a great original hl2/deathmatch charm.<br>
<br>
Congrats on the winners and everyone that entered! It is well deserved.<br>
I know I got what I wanted, such a shame I missed out last time the competition ran. - I really hope this gets people back into playing Deathmatch again.<br>
<br>
P.S. I'm so proud of you Brunt! I knew this had good potential when I tested it with ya.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Does r_drawothermodels 0 remove all the entities? Removing the weapon looks better ofcourse, but the lack of seeing any props or weapon placements on the maps make them look really desolate.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

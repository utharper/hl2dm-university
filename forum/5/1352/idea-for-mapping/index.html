	<div class="content">I have been talking about this with briggs for some time.<br>
It would be nice to have more "quake-like" maps on hl2dm, or more "vertical" ones.<br>
Most maps are mostly on the same height level... or if there is any variation, it's not that much.<br>
Avalon is a great map, and it's a "vertical" one too. Would be nice too see some original stuff made with this idea, cuz it allows nice mid-air fragging.<br>
Other than Avalon I can only think of (maybe a bit) aim_Arena, and then killboxes =/.<br>
Just thought I would leave my opinion to all mappers out there...hopefully someone takes it into account ^^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

that's true ^^.<br>
Having some good jump pads, teleporters or whatever would be sweet.<br>

Ah that's funny, I like that white marble texture and it makes almost all models very visible, except super combine. Spookface is a remake of a HLDM map, which I think had many graphics.  <br>
<br>
I have never liked the industrial look of lockdown, backbone, zeta in hl2dm...I guess I just got sick of it after playing HL2. Avalon is also one of my favorites for looks and concept. Lost Arena is another example of a map I like the look of.<br>
<br>
Different strokes I guess. I still can't get people to like spookface reloaded, even though I have had some of my best 1v1s there.<br>
<br>
Wait, since when do we care what a map looks like anyway?? Onti you should come and 1v1 me in spookface, I'll give you a tour etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He made dm_deudal, and dm_rigormortis....I'll have to take you to his server sometime onti..<br>
<br>
or checkout <a href="http://www.qsextreme.com" class="postlink">http://www.qsextreme.com</a> for screens of his maps. But yes I love all his maps (except the halloween ones, they are fun, but not fun to play for me)<br>

Spookface is awesome gameplay for a pub because there are plenty of weapons and plays smooth from anything of a 1 v 1 to a 12 player free for all...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Although he hasnt been mentioned here, which doesnt surprise me, but if people were to be more acceptant of his maps instead of criticising them like most did with dm_lostvillage_v2 just over stupid things like the color of the roofs and stuff, he would probably be more likely to share these other quake maps and his other, like dozen maps with the community instead of keeping them to inclan use, just because he's tired of peoples bickering over rudermentary things and not giving the maps a chance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

in my mind some reasons:<br>
<br>
1) more shit added; worse the fps  <br>
2) nice looking pointless areas which are pointless to the gameplay and add nothing to the gameplay<br>
3) it's hard to balance.<br>
4) some people are visually artistic people who can easily make very nice maps but don't even know how to play hl2dm at a level above newbie.<br>
5) people who are good at the game don't map.<br>
6) takes a lot of time and hard work<br>
7) difficult to wrap ones head around both concepts and make a map work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't like "more shit added". It would end up like drift, which even in the revised version fps are really low. I'm just saying some nice selection of textures, or even cool custom ones.

same as above.<br>
<br>
There are already good maps out there, both visually and regarding gameplay. So I doubt it isn't possible to do it =/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Onti and Meekle, the question and the answer posted above by you two derives from your own personal view and does not reflect an <strong class="text-strong">objective</strong> reality (if there is such a thing...i think to an extent, yes).<br>
There are some very good maps out there that are both beautiful and play good hence are balanced. the technical statements in your post Meekle are wrong. most things you state aren't so and those that are - can be well worked around.<br>
i happy to think, as i stated before that Caverns is indeed a beautiful map. if you don't think so Mr. author - well that just proves my point. its all about personal preference.<br>
<br>
all in good spirit my friend <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">de_wanda, perhaps the most beautiful CS:S map, but it plays out terrible FPS-wise and perhaps not well gamewise (it's 70MB, so no server is going to play that).<br>
<br>
background_mill, it's not even a map to play on. It's just like a piece of 3d artwork, really.<br>
<br>
dm_peachs_castle, OMG IT'S THE CASTLE FROM MARIO 64, let's play it due to nostalgia rather than due to the map being good or well thought out.<br>
<br>
dm_lockdown, Valve got lucky on designing this, but the contest winners failed with their maps.<br>
<br>
dm_shitbox_with_uber_leet_jumps_balance_and_tricks, a map made by a great gamer with a good sense of balance, skill, potential, etc. But he is too lazy to texture and create actual architecture cause he wants to actually play the game or doesn't want to learn the intricacies.<br>

there are good looking maps, and there are maps that play really good. I just said I like the combination.<br>

King_air is nearly done with basic structure, but I am taking it slow as always. I do not want to rush at any point and come up with a map like ctf_revolution in which one part of the map is well designed and the other is... well... bland in nice terms.

Once people played it and get enlightened by all the engenuity (or w/e you'd spell that) they'll eventually get someone lazy enough to just change textures or w/e and make it nice looking.<br>
<br>
ie: I love lostvillage except for a few things, but it looks horrible, PS2 textures all over the screen with HL1 Grass. But there's a couple of different versions out there. Same for Lockdown.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

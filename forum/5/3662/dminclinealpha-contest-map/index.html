<br>
Overview:<br>
<br>
The map’s primary setting is set in a rundown urbanesque setting with plenty of buildings that can be used for control points and basic cover.  The map’s name comes from the fact that there is lot of vertical elevation involved in here and this vertical elevation really helps the maps flow.  There are many stairways and ramps that you can use to get a higher level against your opponents, but with a cost.<br>
<br>
Gameplay (4v4, Team):<br>
<br>
This is one of the main points in the map’s layout.  While the vertical areas offer much better positions than “out in the open”, being lower in this map usually means getting much more ammo and weapons as there aren’t any on the higher levels.  So while you might be safer taking cover in a building, your enemies outside will have a better supply of grenades and flanking opportunities.<br>
<br>
Good teams will have to balance keeping control of a area while scavenging weapons and supplies on the floor.  Some 4 player teams may have 2 players hold an area while 2 go get weapons and supplies then switch out.<br>
<br>
No control point in the map is “safe” as many buildings have holes in their roofs or have basic faults that can cause a team to easily flank anyone inside.<br>
<br>
Gameplay (1v1, Versus):<br>
<br>
The map is built to be very friendly to getting to places quickly.  While it might seem like a huge big environment, there are many options to getting to point A to point B, some safer than others.<br>
<br>
Like teamplay, players might want to go scavenging for weapons and supplies then take cover somewhere.  Rinse and repeat.  Beware of the differences in elevation, you might have to face a opponent who has higher ground!<br>
<br>
For many of the people who like jumping, the map does have some alternative ways of getting places by careful jumping.  Though a misjump might lead to falling down and taking off some of your health.<br>

POST CONTEST NOTES:<br>
<br>
I had alot of fun making this map in my spare time and I am eager to see what the maps in the top 3 play like.  Any judges who saved their scoresheet on my map, feel free to post critiques or email me your scoresheets if you saved them.  Thanks in advance!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This map is yet another that I thought would make an awesome pub map.  I think it was too big for a competative map which was why it didnt make it to my top 3.  I sincerely would like to see this map finished because the jumps are very cool and overall I do think this map would be alot of fun to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I really like the open-endedness of this. Initial player-less performance seems good too... Jumps and dimensions are all navigable and smooth... Wanted to throw the trash can, why not?... That big ladder is fun-kay man...Interior lighting needs work, as does a lot of the texturing...<br>
<br>
Obviously the map is early beta, with dev textures and missing displacements etc, but it shows tons of promise in the fun department. Keep working on this!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">We playtested this map the other night with 12 players and it plays great!  Really nice layout and the map plays much bigger than it actually is. However, like Haymaker pointed out, there are a few places where the textures appear to be not finished.  Also, there are a few floor areas where there appear to be unfinished "mirror" textures that if you shoot them with a gun it emits a rainbow effect.  None of us in the playtest had ever seen that before, including two expereinced mappers.  It was a truly cool effect but we were speculating whether this was possibly by design? <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You mean the particles that fly out? That happens when you shoot a custom texture without a real "material." The game doesn't know if that "texture" is wooden, metallic, etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">3dsky pls it hurts my eyes otherwise.<br>
could do with some better physics weapons paint buckets aren't a big attack item<br>
the bookcase physics aren't useful either sorry just don't see them being used only ran by<br>
the glass you chose to use doesn't seem to be visible from both sides either<br>
and missing displacements as most ppl have said<br>
<br>
but it has a decent maneuverability setup could be better but its ok</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">congrats on this map, i like the freshness you have, my only criticism would be that for a themed map its slightly unnatural in look. I really like the way you have the layout but would like to see you using more traditional architecture and destroying certain sections to achieve your layout.  <br>
also maybe revise your choice of textures, picking a few core textures helps me bring a map together when detailing it. Great work..  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i don't really have much criticism to lay on ya because i think you've just begun mapping so i can only suggest - READ READ READ. tons of info on the internetz about mapping with hammer. there's lots of links here (check my sig), a lot of tuts on interlopers, fpsbanana and elsewheres. just do some more reading and keep on mapping. this is absolutely wonderful.<br>

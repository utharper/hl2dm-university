	<div class="content">My buddy is making a map in HL2DM that requires a timer that can be started by a player pressing a button, then stopped by that same player pressing another button (the timer needs to be seen by, a 'ref' at best, and at worst, atleast the player pressing the buttons). So far he has had no luck posting in the different map making forums around the web and it was suggested over at the HL2CTF forums you guys might be able to tell him something. Any help is appreciated.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Essentially the player will press a button that will start a timer that will count up from 0. He will then perform certain tasks on the map, and once complete will press a 2nd button (or maybe the same button) and the timer will stop. So we just want to be able to time the players actions then that will help us determine who completed the tasks the fastest.<br>
<br>
ref=referee<br>
<br>
No event needs to be fired that I know of other than the clock starting and stopping. Yes, it would be nice to reset the timer so the next person could start with a fresh clock.<br>

I will ask him to come post.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its going to be a major headache if the timer needs to be tied to a specific player though, is this needed or are you counting on a single player using the timer at any given time?<br>

Rather busy atm, but I'll put together a timer vmf as soon as I can.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

My friend has tried to register for this forum but you have to be activated and it's been a couple of days now, but he's reading what you are saying and I can speak for him for the time being if you need anymore info.<br>

<ul>
<li>Left button starts the timer (also resets it if it has been used previously)</li>
<li>Right button stops the timer</li>
<li>Timer will count up to 999 seconds then reset to 000</li>
<li>Relevant button will be locked when used</li></ul>

Read the README.txt <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
The texture used for the numbers is a 128px x 128px animated texture with 10 frames, you'll probably want to make something that looks a bit nicer than my test texture. More info on making animated textures <a href="http://www.editlife.net/tutorial.php?tutid=43" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline">here</span></a><br>
<br>
It's a <em class="text-italics">very</em> complicated setup, I suggest pulling it apart and looking at every entity's settings and input/output and making sure you understand how it all works before making any changes. You can get more info on the entities used at the <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_entities" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Valve Developer Wiki</span></a>.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Actually, that is not true. I gave you a link on the ctf forums that will accomplish the same thing boshed has done. Only difference is, he was nice enough to make you one lol.

Oh nice, I checked lopers to see if anybody had done something similar but didn't think to look in the portal tutorials. Only one I could find was <a href="http://www.interlopers.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=19883&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;hilit=number" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline">this one</span></a> which is ingenious but a bit er, well ... see for yourself.<br>
<br>
I'm using a very messy bunch of logic_case in my version as I couldn't find a way to pass a counter value directly to an env_texturetoggle frame number, but it appears from your link that it can be done with a material_modify_control. That will really simplify things, thanks <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I've given the text functionality to the <strong class="text-strong">timer_relay_start</strong>, but you can also put it in the <strong class="text-strong">timer_button_start</strong>, since the button gets locked after being used it will do the same effect.<br>
<br>
I also added a separate button for the same effect. So you can see how it's made without having to look into all the outputs from the logic_relay. Not that they are many  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
Play with the <strong class="text-strong">game_text</strong> entity a bit, it is a very simple entity, but also limited in some ways, unfortunatelly.<br>
<br>
This thread helped me a lot since I also needed a counter, but for a countdown, reversed.<br>
Thx to boshed, I got it.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>

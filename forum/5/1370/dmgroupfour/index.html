hi mappers. please fix this map, it always lagged fps-wise <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> i liked it when it was released but avoided it because it was a frames per second mess. it has a rly cool layout. its even named after an awesome Massive Attack song.<br>

	<div class="content">hmm... not much you can do with this type of maps. any map that let's you see other areas around it will have low FPS. Thatâ€™s how the Source engine works. Look at lost_village for example: all areas have great FPS apart from the tank area when facing inward to the map...you see FPS drop. that is because when you face this way the engine draws other sections of the map even though those extend beyond your player's view: the engine still render them. Now look at groupfour. most internal areas you will have a large space filled with props and geometry and have metal grates separating between floors...forcing the engine to renders those rooms for you. not to mention look inward on the map from the water side - you are literally rendering more or less the complete map at that time.<br>
<br>
Might be a good idea to have ppl (given the fact machines are of higher level these days) download and give it a go locally. See how much FPS you're getting (type net_graph 1 / 2 / 3 in your console to see FPS , etc.)<br>
My take it that you would still get low FPS but not necessarily lag.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

this is the author's page.<br>
check what he's saying about his dm_groupfour on the map page:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
" New map that I've been working on. After I finished the principle geometry, my frame rates were crawling at the speed of stop. Thus, I ended up doing research on Hint brushes, and the like, an area of map making I've never ventured. However, not too much of an improvement on the frame rate, spare some inside areas.<br>
Lots of new aestetic experiments I tried out, such as contrasting colored lighting (Red+green, Blue+orange, Green+orange, Yellow+blue), spotlight sprites, etc. Again the only downfall it seems is the framerate, which spikes quite a bit in the outside areas. I have yet to put in weapons, physics objects galore, and spawn points.<br>
<br>
Also, I tried to model the feel of the map based on the feel of a Massive Attack song, titled Group Four. Kinda dark sounding, seems to fit."</em></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yeah Ive been stand-and stare at this one a few times. great architecture. I'm guessing by that quote that the author never explored open areaportals; shut a couple of windows here and there and fill doors with areaportals, the inside would skyrocket. The major drag outside is the water and the amount of detail out there.<br>

BTW...and that's only me...as much as i take pleasure from walking through amazingly large, detailed DM maps i think this is an obsolete trend and maybe about time to move on. as an author of such a monster (hihi) i think, today, that its so much more fun to play smaller and faster maps with better flow and FPS.  this is DM after all...not CO-OP. <br>

	<div class="content">alright.. so as an example if the map is split into 2 separate sections so it's indoor / outdoor .. and there are no places on any areas of the map where you can see outside from the inside (except for the connecting hall etc)  and vice versa fps would probably double. <br>
<br>
as you can see these windows really do a number on the fps.. because you can see into the buildings from way back from the docks. etc.<br>

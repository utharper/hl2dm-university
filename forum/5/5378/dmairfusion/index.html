	<div class="content">A new version which has fixed all the competitive-worthy issues that *could* be fixed can be found right <a href="http://www.liquimetal.com/frank/hl2mp/maps/dm_airfusion_prefinal.bsp.bz2" class="postlink">hurr</a>. <br>
If you opt to download from that previous link you may need to get 7zip to extract it, which can be found <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" class="postlink">here</a>. <br>
You can also get it via fast D/L on either Warfare Arena.<br>
<br>
This thread is now for feedback and such; I am posting this with abnoksious' blessing because he has better things to do like work on this <a href="http://www.worldoftanks.com/" class="postlink">World of Tanks</a> project. It's a pretty neat game. <br>
I'll get more into it when he has finished modeling the American Tank tree. That's right, he is not on a team or anything, he does this all by himself. Abnok is just that fucking amazing. Really. He is. I may or may not be lying my ass off, but you all should be sure to check that shit out and try to get a beta key. My penis is still very small. <br>
<br>
Please test the fuck out of this map. <br>
The changes were all small architectural changes that improve combat in many areas, and no more silly ice-skating glass floors and such.<br>
The other changes I will leave you all to find. Pretty sure you will find them all awesome and think to yourselves that the guy who suggested/thought of them is probably a nice tall drink of water. I am, yes.<br>

	<div class="content">I fiddled around on this map on Warfare for quite a bit and I find that I get faaaaaaar less fps than the previous version. This is most apparent when standing behind the curved wall at top mag or perch mag or whatever you wanna call the spot where everyone camps mag. I lose over 120 fps and it gets quite sluggish. I'm pretty confident this isn't due to my computer but rather a spot where vis-leafs weren't built correctly. The whole map just doesn't feel as smooth as before to me.<br>
<br>
Also, the trigger_push lifts still get 3/4 of the people who go in them stuck near the lip of the exit. This happens at critical times (at least for me) and is incredibly frustrating. <br>
<br>
There are various aesthetic changes that are fairly sweet looking but most of them don't really contribute to anything other than chipping away at performance. <br>
<br>
Newguy, you know I love you, but I think this revision needs a slight revision. Just my 2 cents.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">@VitaminG: Yes, you are correct. My PC does dip to 270 fps at that spot, and considering the hardware I am using on a nearly 6 year old game that is a reason to be concerned. However, FPS was much worse in the 3rd beta layout of this map. All the mapping judges who saw this map know what I am talking about. It was considerably faster than the map is now; there was no downward motion in the hallway that now has the only rpg ammo in it, and no curve was present connecting back-mag to ar2 or mag-pillar to main. It was a smaller, faster, more in-your-face map.<br>
This version still gets world's better FPS than that beta3 version. I then told abnok to take away some line-of-sight to try to make it so clients did not have the draw the ENTIRE map at ALL times. Now the layout is set, and the separation of trench and main/rpg is essential for the team-play theme/strategy of the map. In short, I don't think FPS will get much better. This is going to be a work that abnok shows all his future potential employers, and I don't think anyone should ask him to "dumb-down" this wonderful looking environment for the sake of smoothing it out for a minority of gamers who are using outdated hardware. I will ask him to float the vmf to Valar and other mappers and such to see if a fresh set of eyes can make the map more smooth, and eventually we may see a slight increase in optimization; however, I would not expect too much to get better in terms of FPS.<br>
The human eye can only see about 70fps, and you don't really notice horrible lag until it goes under 30. I love you too G, but I work 2 jobs that are only entry-level and even I was able to invest some money in a PC that runs this map very well with on all settings maxed @ 1080p resolution. <br>
<br>
@keefy: Ah, good, another player who knows that entities are meant to be eye-candy and nothing more. The term you are looking for is making it static or non-solid. <br>
They are NOT meant to be apart of game-play in any way, shape, or form. Sure, that makes it less realistic, but we are throwing 'nades with a zero-point-energy-field-manipulator and shooting orbs made of some dark-matter shit which has yet to be named by human science; so if you want realism, go play a shittier game like BFbc2. <br>
I told him to make all such things non-solid, but he is in fact human and missed a few. It is easy to fix, and thank you. <br>
<br>
As far as that other clip goes, ...nah, that area is meant to allow a player to get nestled into the perfect spot to shot an orb to clear out the super charger area. With it the way it is you can get into position rather easily in mid bhop. Then again if more players want it clipped, it will be clipped. It is just that simple. <br>
<br>
@Maxtasy: Thank you sir, abnok is very concerned about how professional his map should look and will love that you caught that screeny for him. <br>
<br>
About the "lifts" or air-ladders as they are called (and that is what they are called because they were my fucking idea, so fuck you rico/billy): He has made it so the ladder pushes you up, but not really out; the player is now expected to jump out of the ladder area. <br>
I have yet to get stuck myself in all my extensive testing, but please let me know if by "get stuck" you all mean that you're unable to exit the lift on your own and have to spec/suicide out of them. This was a minor change to a very new form of transition. If problems persist, abnok will have to make the force-push actually push the player into the worlds shortest teleport in order to get the fast air-ladder to function properly. Then you wont be able to have that speed in your bhop when you are rushing someone at super-charger, but that would be a necessary sacrifice if clients are getting utterly stuck in the air-ladder itself. <br>
<br>
Thank you all for your input, please keep it coming. <br>
If you all do scrim on this map please record demos so if you encounter a glitch I can see it for myself and send it to abnoksious. <br>
I am particularly worried about a "bad clip" that nino mentioned while pubbing on the map which was near the zero-point. Not sure if it was real or if he was just being retarded w/ a smg nade, but yah, please keep your eye's peeled. Screens and demos will be rewarded with cake. <br>
<br>
Wow, I just went a long time w/out saying my dick is small; glad I put a stop to that else we would have fucking anarchy around here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

All these brush/texture errors happened when he re-made the map and changed the layout to its current form. (from dm_airfusion_beta3 to dm_airfusion)<br>
Considering all the displacements and shit, and the fact he made the entire map in less than 4 weeks, I'd say he did a pretty damn good job. <br>
But yah, thank you all for the screens and the time taken to discover the issues. <br>
Abnoksious will be very concerned with those aesthetics considering he wants this work to look utterly professional. <br>

You don't need more orbs; you just have to be accurate with the ones you get. <br>

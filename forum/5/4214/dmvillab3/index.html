	<div class="content">Hello all here at the Deathmatch University! It's been awhile since my last map update, six months or so, but I have not come empty handed! I was able to use almost every bit of feedback, advice, and criticism from the second version to make this third version, and I feel like it is ten times better for it. I'm hoping with just a little more work, this map will be more for fun than for feedback.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.uploadpedia.com/29KZGCGJNHWU/dm-villa-b3-rar.html" class="postlink">dm_villa_b3.rar - 2.8 Mb</a><br>
<br>
This is currently the third beta version of the map, and I've uploaded it for playtesting and constructive criticism and feedback.<br>
This is a map best suited for anywhere from 2 to 10 players, spanning three levels: basement cavern, villa main floor, and the rooftop.<br>
<br>
To install, simply move the "half-life 2 deathmatch" folder into your ...Steam\steamapps\(username) directory.<br>
<br>
I'd like to give a big thanks to the community here at hl2dmu, and at interlopers.net, and fpsbanana for putting so much time and effort into helping me refine this map. There was a lot to sift through and I wouldn't have been able to do it without you guys.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
<br>
I wanted to credit Bosh and Valar for coming up with the IOs for the health and armor charger lights, they look pretty cool.<br>

Version .3 Changelog:<br>
<br>
*Tripled the size of the existing backyard area, added new building to the main complex for looks.<br>
*Added new cave room, and a new entrance to the caves from the main courtyard to improve flow.<br>
*It is now possible to enter the courtyard hallway through a hole in the wall, to allow players greater freedom of movement.<br>
*Increased the size of the villa living room to ease player movement.<br>
*Fixed issues with small props getting in the way of players trying to pick up larger physics objects.<br>
*Made small touches to layout to enhance speed of movement and ease of movement.<br>
*Raised the skybox, now the grenades shouldn't magically bounce off of the sky.<br>
*Added lighting to darker areas of the map.<br>
*Changed weapon layout throughout the map; most importantly, I removed all but *one* of the SLAMs!<br>
*Made various cosmetic changes to improve visual quality.<br>
*Added clipping in many areas, since there were quite a few problems with players getting snagged on the walls.<br>
*Optimized map for fps' sake: compiled in LDR with higher lightmaps than the last version. Visleafs have been optimized as well for performance.<br>
*Overall map size is now ONE SIXTH what it used to be. I don't know how I pulled that one off honestly...<br>

	<div class="content">Some parts need clipping. i found those during a quick runabout. <br>
<br>
<img src="http://img2.pict.com/26/4d/1e/1002734/0/800/dmvillab30001.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
the corner should be closed together with the wooden thingy.<br>

You might want to clip some of the interior.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://www.pict.com/view/1002760/0/dmvillab30003" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
The part of the L with the saw blades should be widened.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img2.pict.com/72/33/bb/1002761/0/800/dmvillab30004.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
The doorway should be clipped against the wall.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img2.pict.com/d8/5c/df/1002733/0/800/dmvillab30005.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
The hall could be wider and the entrances to the hall should be higher so you can move in and out using strafe jumps with more ease. <br>
<br>
The last opinion form me, no slams! it's a quite narrow map at places. They destroy the flow of the map, when you have to look for slams all the time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Your level of finish here is exceptional, great work there! Lighting is really effective. The new courtyard is a vast improvement. <br>
<br>
I still found obstacles to gameplay anathema to 'tight' maps, mostly sticky decorative objects ( make 'em nonsolid ). Not much you can do about the close quarters but be aware that melee becomes pretty attractive in those situations.<br>
<br>
Also was curious why the ledge by the high curved wall was clipped off, you've even got a little walkway leading to it.<br>
<br>
This would make a top choice for conversion to SP like in that current contest idea. The caves especially remind me of that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

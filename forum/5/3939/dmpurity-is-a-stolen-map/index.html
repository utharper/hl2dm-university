	<div class="content">Ahh the Real McCoy. Topped with a nice VAC ban. who would believed it.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
BTW, (K)rypt claimed in several occasions my issue is with him using "my textures". Well now (K)rypt, even though some of the texture you are using are my modifications of EXISTING ONES - NONE of these textures are mine, my intellectual property or made by me. Unless of course I made CS:S and other assorted mods and I have no recollection of doing so.<br>
So, to put things right - i am not claiming theft over use of textures Mr. McCoy;<br>
My claim for threat is specifically for not only blatantly ripping off designs from several of my maps but literally copying whole parts of brushwork from these maps. This is pure THEFT and to think anyone would support this crap is preposterous (look it up).<br>
<br>
For months on months you have PM me through Steam asking all sorts of questions ranging from how to work and apply textures to models to brushwork to whatthefuckhaveyou so you can go and steal my work to get props for it? then over this forum you tell me to stop being a <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Jew</span> about it? are you kidding me? Have you lost your mind? Mr. McCoy, your pathetic behavior aside, can't you see this has already damaged you and believe you me, Mr. McCoy, it will keep on damaging you more and more.<br>
<br>
You should stop claiming you didn't steal and simply come clean, Mr. McCoy. Best come in nice and say "i'm sorry for being a Liar i will never do that again to anyone".<br>
I can easily prove my case and you know this very well. I have your maps' VMFs and i obviously have mine <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> it is very easy to show how you've copy pasted shit over from one map to another.<br>
Do not be more of a jackass than you already made yourself.<br>

<br>
screens:<br>
<br>
this is from (k)rypt's dm_proto. look at the jumpad on the floor. this is the best pic i found, i don't have this map.<br>

<br>
this is from (k)rypt's dm_devilsgate (released / upreleased / who cares?). look at this bs:<br>

this is from dm_losthope. see where the bs comes from?<br>

<br>
<br>
this is from (k)rypt's dm_purlieu. note how he "happened" to come up with exactly the same balcony as the one in Milieu. gee, what a coincidence!<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/purlieu1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
this is from dm_milieu<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/milieu1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<br>
this is from (k)rypt's dm_purlieu. amazing how he "accidentally" thought of using the exact same fern prop with exactly the same green light with almost exactly the same tone and brightness values to hide ammo...again, just as in milieu (BTW, don't anybody think the name purilieu is a "bit" close to milieu? nah must be me. i should leave the poor kid alone to explore)<br>

<br>
another fascinating coincidence from (k)rypt's dm_purlieu.<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/purlieu3.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
can't be a copy-paste. has to be a different explanation..<br>
this is milieu:<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/milieu3.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<br>
a wall that looks exactly like 99% of losthope with wooden supports from milieu in (k)rypt's purileu:<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/purlieu4.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
and in milieu..<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/milieu4.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
i'm telling you this cannot be it. just can't - from purileu:<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/purlieu5.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
and milieu again..<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/milieu5.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>

(k)rypt's dm_purileu - wooden railing. great job!!!<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/purlieu8.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
ooppss hold it. i've seen this somewhere. guess what map? you got it! dm_milieu:<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/hammeripped/milieu8.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<br>
can't be the same exact displacement punched about a little? dm_purlieu<br>

I'm not even going to bother showing the stunning resemblance between every inch in all the maps Mr. McCoy's "made" during the last 4 months and the ones i have. i'm not going to showcase the textures and designs in purity, proto and all the other pieces of crap he's pulled off. if anyone still has any doubts they should make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. and fast.<br>

	<div class="content">The first thing i think of is the RPG area. You can easily hide there, and the RPG is easy to get. Where you then have the rpg it's really open, the perfect spot for a RPG. This makes it really easy to just camp there lining up frag after frag. I would like to see it maybe a bit cramped pr something that makes it harder to get the RPG. So it's not so easy to get it and hold taht position. <br>
<br>
Also the sounds is cool like the first time. Then it gets annoying, espcially when dude x camps the rpg and you hear it every 20 seconds. If not more often.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">mmm yeah i'm inclined to side with wt somewhat, but only because I haven't seen much evidence of your scenario. The few games I've seen on it the rpg didn't account for a huge percentage of kills, though it was higher in 1v1 of course, in bigger games every time the alarm went off tons of crap went flying into the zone there, barrels nades props bullets...<br>
<br>
The original layout did have a smaller area there and it was suggested numerous times to expand that, adding extra time to the play was a good thing I think. Though perhaps one of the panels could be mangled in such a way that it's harder to fly a rocket out of there.<br>
<br>
The alarm I agree with, though you're the first to verbalise my thought on that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

And every time i died which didn't happen a lot. He could just camp there instead. It's a very simpl tactic and the other team didn't have a chance. Note that it was even teams skill wise. Maybe if you wanna run and gun without tactics the rpg kills won't go up but with this simple tactic they didn't stand a chance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'd thought I put enough holes to hide from a long rocket shot elsewhere. Thanks for your input too btw</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ive only played it once with some ppl, I can't rly tell how good or bad the items/weapons placement are, but they seemded nice to me. The thing I got my attention into the most was the looks. I love the theme and the cleaness of the map.<br>
<br>
here's what I could notice so far:<br>
I agree with the sounds getting a bit repetitive.<br>
The outside area is a completely empty. That's just the looks, indeed, but if you look a little closer it's easily perceivable. Gives me the feeling of "artificial".<br>
<br>
For the rest its an excelent map imo so far.<br>

	<div class="content">I've been on this map in a full server(14 players), and for such a concentrated playing field, the connectivity and z-axis elements make this really fun to play. I don't think that this could be described as a 1 on 1 map even though it's square footage would seem to indicate it. This is a compliment to Hay's ability to see the bigger picture. If there are only two players in the map, than movement is not dictated by survival. Of course you can pick a power corner and take heavy arms potshots at each other. But with a full server load, the map becomes a constant battle for the win. Please swing by the FF servers and give this one a try, preferrably in the afternoons or on a weekend with a large player load. It will make a huge difference in your critical criteria. I for one have seen this map in it's last few beta stages, and it's uniqueness in combination with Hay's subtle mapping mastery make it one for the books.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Visuals:</strong><br>
<br>
Wonderful theme! It would have been very easy to be lazy and make it boxy and plain but the attention to detail such as the cracks, subtle curves and destruction really bring this one alive.<br>
<br>
Sexy lighting and lightmap work, really does feel hot and the bright sun through the alleys between buildings is perfect - not distracting but easily noticeable.<br>
<br>
Great combination of models to make the cool solar panels and the litte combine touches around bring it into the hl2 world nicely.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Gameplay:</strong><br>
<br>
Lunacy. Fast and frantic with very little respite with a larger crowd in, no matter which way I turned there was either somebody to fight or some essentials to gather before somebody else did.<br>
<br>
Some nifty routes around and the tiny ledges and goodies in the windows make it worthwhile for explorers, nice touch.<br>
<br>
As mentioned already the RPG sound repeating gets very annoying, sure you will come up with something to sort that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Overall:</strong><br>
<br>
I've really enjoyed playing it and it's gone down a storm on the S-UK server with many people requesting it. It seems a little small for larger teamplay groups but I'm looking forward to trying some 2v2 action.<br>
<br>
Thumbs up!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">me and el prez played luke and fearsome on it, honestly its hard for me to find something bad about this map.  It feels like its not going to flow well, but once you get going it plays alot like LD (tight areas and a decent amount of props). I love the textures used in the map and the props are very fitting.  Only thing i noticed off the get-go, was only one 30charger (if i'm not mistaken), maybe add another charger elsewhere?  I see this being a fun map to play, and like all new maps, will be awhile before people truly adjust and start to request it more frequently in matches, but it gets a big thumbs up from me <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

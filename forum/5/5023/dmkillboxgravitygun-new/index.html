<br>
For this map you spawn with the gravity gun to start with, its very fun physics madness and up to 16 players. <br>
Also the map is useful for players that want to really improve there gravity gun skill and be a better player.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">About:</strong></span> Below are sub headings about the map and images to make things easy. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Map Performance</strong></span><br>
The map has been heavily optimized because of the mount of physics in the map. <br>
The shadows have been disabled for the physics, and items like suit, heath, stick, crowbar, chargers etc have a fade render setting. <br>
These settings have given the map a huge frame rate boost, so the frame rate stays high all the time ingame. <br>
Also the trap monitor turns off if no one is the room watching it. <br>
The map is very stable and you won’t get lag in any form or crash because of tweaks in map performance, also thanks to map testers.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Wall Curves</strong></span><br>
The bottom walls/light areas has been designed to reflect physics model that hit it.<br>
<img src="http://gtamike.tsgk.com/dm_killbox_gravity_gun_images/gif/wall_an.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Lifts</strong></span><br>
I have improved the lifts in the map the best I can, they are not affected by physics models that go under them and will not go back up right after hitting a physic model.<br>
<img src="http://gtamike.tsgk.com/dm_killbox_gravity_gun_images/gif/lift_an.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Containers</strong></span><br>
People can’t camp and hide in the containers because of a useful button that forces them out after pressed by someone, then you can decide how to take care of them. <br>
In the 2 containers there are health, suit, crowbars and stun sticks only visible/rendered when in containers or very near.<br>
<img src="http://gtamike.tsgk.com/dm_killbox_gravity_gun_images/small_size/camp.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Teleport Room</strong></span><br>
Only small physics (like blades) can go in the teleport room. <br>
You do this by passing them through the blue areas at door way. <br>
The 1st teleport is easy to see, just jump on the box then jump again forward to be teleported, then box behind you will break so no body can follow you right away.  <br>
The 2nd teleport is in that room but you can work that one out hehe. <br>
<img src="http://gtamike.tsgk.com/dm_killbox_gravity_gun_images/small_size/teleport_room.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<img src="http://gtamike.tsgk.com/dm_killbox_gravity_gun_images/small_size/box.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Trap</strong></span><br>
The trap is located in the super charger room when someone is inside the room a green light will turn on from the outside of the room. <br>
If no body is inside the room the outside light will stay red.<br>
By pressing the button the trap will enable metal gates that will lock the player inside of the room. <br>
The player will hear a moving metal sound and then see a solid metal crusher will slowly come down. <br>
The metal crusher will stop at the players head, make a nasty creaking sound and then will crush the player at lightning speed, also play a sound on impact. <br>
There’s another button that does the same thing, it is found in the teleport room with a monitor to watch the player.<br>

<img src="http://gtamike.tsgk.com/dm_killbox_gravity_gun_images/small_size/mon.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">The map is 100% remade/drawn from scratch and stable</strong></span><br>
It has a new name, improved design, layout of physics, lighting, textures, sounds, models, teleports, help text, <br>
smaller map area size, fall damage disabled, shadows, and heavily optimized, the list goes on.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Bigger Pictures</strong></span><br>

This will be for a week to see how it goes, then back to normal mapcycle again with the new map added to list. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool">  <br>

<br>
I was inspired by a graviy gun only server mod in 2006 I loved it and  really helped my skill at the time, also the map had 2 containers with items in and was a white killbox.<br>
<br>
When the server went and that good graviy gun mod went with it. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
So I had to make my own version and learn how to map. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
<br>
So I made my own version and design of a gravity gun killbox in 2007.<br>
A clan liked it so much they hosted it 24/7 just that map in cycle. But a year later the clan broke up and server went to, they stopped playing hl2dm.<br>
<br>
2 weeks ago 2010 I was looking back at the map thinking, you know what I can make this map alot better, cause i've improve these past 3 years in mapping. <br>
(I had to start from some where and improve in time) <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
<br>
So I decided to make the map from scratch and give it a new name and features. I can live my past dream again in a gravity gun killbox. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

I already have a map called killbox_ggun, this is named frustratingly similarly<br>
<br>
Not sure, however, that I ever published it here so maybe it's understandable<br>
<br>
Quick question:  What did you do to make the gravgun-only work properly?  Everything I tried to remove weapons was seriously buggy</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've got problems with the implementation of the custom models in mine, it only really works conveniently if I host it.  Plus I'm a selfish dbag<br>
<br>
it's not that good anyhow, but it's decent for low grav fights especially because I know which weapons are weighted more heavily</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hello all! <br>
<br>
Some people wanted less physics in the map. <br>
So here's a more optimized map version to increase server performance with less physics. <br>
<a href="http://forum.tsgk.com/viewtopic.php?mode=attach&amp;id=7396" class="postlink">http://forum.tsgk.com/viewtopic.php?mode=attach&amp;id=7396</a><br>
<br>
If you want more phyiscs use original map version "dm_killbox_gravity_gun"<br>

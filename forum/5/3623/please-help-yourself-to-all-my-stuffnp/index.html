Looks like he just moved a few brushes around. I had to snicker at the roof texture in the 2nd shot. So the guy is talented enough to claim credit for this but not to align a texture decently?<br>
<br>
Technically his comment about custom content is correct...still If I were you Valar i would get your hands dirty with rotten fruit and post a disclaimer there, or at least insist he put a game_text in the map that states you did not compile it.<br>
<br>
There was a mainsteam rock radio hit a couple years ago by a band that completely ripped off Tool, this reminds me of that<br>
<br>
edit: I just had to bite and have a look around. There's been worse ripoffs in history but not quite as thorough and complete as this. Sadly it seems the guy may actually have a handle on layout theory, though the performance is noticeably worse. <br>

its weird that you said this, because i was actually thinking the same thing.  its like he took a bunch of Valar's stuff from a couple maps, put them together is a horrible manner for no reason.  i mean, i cant really think that is a map he is proud of.  idk.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
and no keefy, there is no way of preventing ppl from decompiling maps. BSP is java based and hack easy for anyone who knows Java...but having said that - there is NOTHING WRONG with decompiling. i don't care my maps get decomp'd (and i know they do more than they're played lol) hell i also decomp other ppl's maps myself. this is part of the learning process and it's a great tool for getting a handle on how some things are done. but to actually copy something off the decomp'd map is just BULLSHIT. you know, i've seen at least 20 maps ppl simply copied off my brushwork but i think the main reason was the mapper was new and didn't know how to handle the tool yet but this is like holly shit. he went too far on this one.<br>

	<div class="content">idk what the mappers "code of ethics" is, i can make an educated guess tho.  couple of points that are on my mind:<br>
<br>
1-i played this map to see if Valar had a legitimate case......he absolutely does.  this is straight up, an obvious rip off of 2 of Valar's maps.  if you have played millue or losthope there is no question that you would have to aggree.  <br>
<br>
2-Did the map testers in question have knowledge that Valar was helping him?  the mapper could have told them that Val was helping him and gave him permission to use those ideas.  if it were me testing that map i would have gone to Valar asked him if that were true immediately.  but, that is because im very very close friends with Valar and I am extremely familar with his work and his mapping style.  i dont know voz or beef well enough to know their relationship with Val.  all i am saying is they may have been hosed here too.  if i wasnt good friends with val and didnt know his style as well as i do and i was asked to play test that map and the mapper told me that Val was helping him, i prolly wouldnt have thought twice about it either.  <br>
<br>
3-does anybody know this guy?  could we ask him to post here saying what his intentions were?  i do know that he did credit Valar and his maps on the DL site, and Val said he is new to mapping, so b4 we bash him, we might want to talk to him.  perhaps he didnt know what he was doing was so wrong. (plz dont jump down my throat on that comment) it's just what is obvious to some, isnt obvious to others.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

While testing it, many people said that it looks like milieu, yeah, from the textures and what not, it's from those maps (well really they are all from CSS) But you can't fuckin jump to conclusion that I copied and pasted it.<br>
<br>
I didn't know I was suppose to ask permission to use CSS textures, Its not like I made the map with Valars textures and/or models. If they were CREATED BY HIM, then i would have not used it at all.<br>
<br>
Is it really Valar.Corporation ? no, I am pretty sure all the textures are from the makers of CSS. Hm, Yes, I am right. <br>
<br>
How do YOU have proof that i decompiled your maps, and copied and pasted, When i posted the map, and was writing the description, I wasn't telling everyone I was COPING those maps, I was saying that i USED them for the textures/models.<br>

You jumping to conclusions just isn't fair at all. - I asked for your help many times, and I thank you for all the times that you have helped me with all yuor knowledge. <br>

getting INSPIRED from someone else's work is a major part of what art is all about. but you take that INSPIRATION and elaborate and morph it into something else. something YOURS.<br>
what YOU've done was far from it. anyone could see Milieu and Lost Hope in your map. anyone could not help not notice the variation on Milieu's name in your map.<br>
anyone can see design ideas not only in dm_purilieu but also in dm_unraveling which has Swot's Lostarena written all over it.<br>
I also hear you were told about the similarity to my maps WHILE playtesting. so it seems you had a pretty good idea how all this was going to end.<br>

	<div class="content">I did not see the map so I can't be sure, but Krypt, if what I hear is correct, and the map you made is basically a rip off of Valar's 2 maps just as Unraveling and especially its predecessor (roundarena) is a rip off of lostarea, then he has a right to be upset.  Maybe you should consider being more creative and coming up with your own material instead of borrowing everyone elses.<br>
<br>
Also beware of the flaming and bigotry policy on these forums.  I think you need to be reminded of this:<br>

Dude, you did copy and paste. There is an entire section of Milieu in the map and also an entire section of losthope lol. You dont deserve credit just because you removed a few brushes, moved some props around, and retextured a few things lol. Even if you did create new brushes, they are identical in size, width, and length. Why even bother? Had I did something like that, I would of just copy and pasted it. Would of saved alot of time considering the dimensions were going to be identical lol.<br>
<br>
The proper thing would of been to give Valar the credit and put your name on the ass end for combining his maps to create yours. Although, you would of needed permission from Valar to use his brushwork in the first place so this is all basically nil anyways.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I downloaded that map while searching for "jump" in the IWU maps list. From all the maps I downloaded with keywords "tr" and "jump" I found some maps that are very well known with totaly diferent names and some of them without the original's credits. I can't remember which ones were, but that's one of them. <br>
Man that list if full of rips from ppl maps, but they are cloaked with weird names or just simply diferent ones...<br>

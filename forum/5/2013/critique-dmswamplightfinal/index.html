It's not possible to work on maps when people say things like it does not have good flow or it does not play well. You have to pick apart what exactly is playing well, what exactly is good flow and how does a map not achieve it. <br>

	<div class="content">IMHO such elaborate maps as swamplight have passed away. the only stock map which suvived and is still scrimed is LD and that is because its fast and instantaneous.<br>
a map can be big and yet maintain pace. swamplight cannot. That's what i think.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The other stock maps arent played as much because most of them just plain SUCK!   Swamplight on the other hand is a nice map and IMO fun to play.  It is one of my favorites.  Try playing a CAL match on it, yea its not as fast paced as Zeta or LD, but its a lot of fun and there definately is a stratgey to it.  I would say yes it is worth an update.<br>
<br>
The first thing that comes to mind is yes, random spawns would definatly be a better option.   Id have to run through the map again and check out the FPS, but if would benefit to reoptimize to increase performance then that would be a good idea also.  There really arent that many slams so I dont think they detract from it, but I dont think it matters if they are there or not.  In general I am not crazy about them.  <br>

	<div class="content">One whole end of Swamplight is superfluous.<br>
The rooms on the right side looking from the RPG, with the AR2, sawblades and charger and the shotty are wasted space and slow the map down. Why is the AR2 there?  A mag should be there.<br>
The shotty room is just fodder for the RPG, so nothing ever happens in there. The catwalk is good for what? With a raging battle for RPG, what are you going to do up there?<br>
Yes the room behind it has another access to main room, but there is already one below near it.<br>
A small window to snipe at the RPG would be cool.<br>
<br>
The weapons lay out has always seemed odd.<br>
<br>
that little Culde sac with the Pickup?!?!?!<br>
<br>
There is a strong RPG and a strong side that is defensible and one that is weak. Even to use the right side means getting weapons a good distance away.<br>
Rebels blend in too much in the darker Swamp area.<br>
<br>
The recessed courtyard outside is annoying.<br>
The flow through most of the map is pretty good.<br>

I'm sorry I can't really provide much info about the map, since I haven't played it enough, but I did like the draft night match we played there as far as I recall.<br>

<br>
has anyone ever tryed to do a match without the team spawns on. it might be a little crazy, but it could be fun. i dont know if it will be better, but we could try...don't just say it sux, i want ld. give it a try...<br>

I don't think anyone has tried to take the team spawn out yet because that might be construed as messing with someone elses map so unless Fearsome has talked to the map maker and got permission to do it, then most likely it hasn't been tried.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Well this was one i wanted to remove at the start of the season.  But after scrimming it and matching on it i remember why i like.  Lots of ways to attack the rocket, and one team is basicly given the rocket.  And combine has to attack.  It's different from other maps.  I like to have different game play in my maps so i kinda cringe at people suggesting making it like every other map.  But if their was one thing i would want to change,  it would be increase the FPS outside. mainly when you get in draw range of the water you start to lag a bit.  This was done in dods for this map that had standing water much like swamplight by just reducing the amount of water, still keeping the same feel.<br>
<br>
This map in my opinion is one that doesn't really work in pubs but is great for teamplay.  I like the slams on it because you can get outside and lock it down with them.  It only has 2 slams on either sides of the map.  That map isn't so tight where it restricts movement.  Were slams would be really bad, like cannon_r1 that map is to tight for slams.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

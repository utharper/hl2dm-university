	<div class="content">Map built by [TF2T]cyn for hl2:ctf back in 2007. Retextured and rerigged for hl2:dm by me. Was just getting back into mapping with this map and decided to see how it plays in dm. Might make for interesting gameplay with the aerial type of gameplay (could be similar to aim, but bigger).  It may need a few more weapon spawns if the map gets busy. Props to cyn for allowing me to bring it over to dm <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

<blockquote><div><cite>cyn wrote:</cite>Vast is a port of the Quake 3 map bubctf1 - The Vast and the Furious. It's a set of floating platforms connected by jump pads and speed pads. Just like in its Q3 counterpart, rocket jumping off the speed pads gives you a huge boost. The teleporter below the flag sends you to the top of the tower. If you slip off the edge near the platforms you'll be teleported someplace safe, but if you go flying you're on your own. There are also forgiveness teleporters - if you fall into the void near the platforms you'll be randomly teleported on top of the low pillars. If you really catapult off the side you still die.</div></blockquote>

<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Changes from ctf to dm:</strong><br>
1 - Obvious changes relating to hl2ctf weapons being in the map.<br>
<br>
2 - Updated textures and removal of ctf decals<br>
<br>
3 - Decided to keep true to how the spawns were and create a base-like map as they are rare in dm. So, combine will spawn on combine side and rebel on rebel side. If there are complaints about this, I'll consider changing it up.<br>
<br>
4 - Altered jump pads to work better with dm gravity compared to hl2ctf gravity. Obviously, rocket jumping isn't the same in hl2dm compared to hl2ctf so use at your own risk <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leaving this version as just a release candidate incase of any issues. I used a different type of packer for all the custom files so hopefully it worked out alright. I didnt bother testing it lol.<br>

	<div class="content">hmm. There are a shit load of spawn points. I've never used teambased spawns in dm before so perhaps Im doing something wrong here. I've got 12 rebel and combine spawns on their team side and then added about 8 player deathmatch spawns on each end for when the server is in regular dm mode. I looked at dm_runoff to see how it was done and it was done this way. Are you sure you guys are spawning in the same spot over and over and not right next to it? The spawns are all real close to each other on the backside of each base. Rebels spawn on their base side and combine spawn on their base side. You should always be spawning by the teleporter with 3 ammo crates nearby or right in front of the actual base. There are 6 spawn points on each side there as well. If there were only 2 spawns on the map, and there were a good number of players, players would be spawning on top of each other and spawnkilling each other by spawning on the same spawn point. Is this happening? If not, the spawns are working correctly. Although, if the spawn points are to bunched up, Ill move some to the upper decks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

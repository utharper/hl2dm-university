to me, judging air and helix was like putting a thick, juicy NY strip steak and a rack of baby back ribs that had been smoking all day over hickory wood all day in front of me and asking me to pick one to call the best.......was so hard. in the final vote i did pick helix but i love air.  i also loved pueblo, IMO the only thing that hurt pueblo was the fact i just wasnt big enough for a 4v4 and that was one of the major judging points, and being true to my judging responsibilities, i had to take that into account.  its still an outstanding map, and TBH i think the idea and environment design were the most original of the final 3 maps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I love this shit man. Oozes with the pro touch all around, could easily be an official map from a similar game. In fact I keep thinking HL1, not just the nicely placed soundwork, it's the whole semi-scifi-speediness in there. Reminds me a tiny bit of Sadist's map Sadist's Pit which is another stellar piece of work. And a few nods to Amplitude as well.<br>
<br>
It's very well thought out. I noticed that the control room kinda favours the blue combine guy, for example, if I speed by and glance in quickly. I like how the supercharger is protected slightly from the 180 deg orb bounce from below, difficult to make a blind shot there. And there are some killer orb shots available, that's for sure. I like the little xbow-fence-cage idea, reminds of the long cavern in Backbone a bit, and I kept throwing the low barrel up to the top one forgetting it was there. Causes me to think a little more at that point. And of course the nade-a-port, nice job there making it a valid working idea.<br>
<br>
As for the 4 shotty's I'm sure gameplay will reveal your intentions there.<br>
<br>
Texturing and lighting are spot-on, some great parts in there, especially through the dark texture zones. Love the ceiling and arch/beam details too, I know it's said that players don't look up, but this shows an attention to detail that is uncommon.<br>
<br>
Really the only thing I can say that puzzles me, and I don't think you had a lot of options here, are the phys prop models themselves...Like I said it feels strongly Black Mesa, and somehow the recycling bin, the table, the white propane bottle clash with that vibe ( the exploding barrels are perfect ). Purely aesthetics. Maybe BMS will ask you to port this to their dm package, it's such a solid map it almost transcends this game. Which is something Lockdown can't say for itself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't think so it would be repetitive since you can mix up the layout of them nore would you have to follow a formula which I don't think anyone is really saying that. My point is the number of weapons in relation of to other is important it really does effect how the map is played. As already been said one weapon alone would be used the most which just limits and confines the gameplay on that map. Good maps are those that have diverse gameplay options allowing those of different styles of play to enjoy the map which this is lacking. <br>
<br>
I'm just worried that we are moving to more shotgun orientated maps than one that has weapons balance at it core. Also keep in mind mag is standard weapon of choice to the community just as much as the shotgun and so there should be more than 1 of them on the map especially if it going to be used as a 3v3 map in leagues.<br>
<br>
what I would of done is replaced one of those shotguns with a mag like there is a area in the middle where there is a shotty but not too far on the other side of the wall there is also another shotty you could easily replace that middle shotty with a mag to improve the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If anything I'd look to replacing the shotty near the rpg with a mag so they're at opposite ends of the map and give anybody light on weapons in that area a fighting chance against a player with the RPG. And possibly move the shotty in the open area elsewhere.<br>

I prefer that weapons are placed where they are <strong class="text-strong">not </strong>to their best advantage, making whoever pick them up wanting to move on. Keep this shotty and move another rather.<br>

I'm sure you will receive tons of feedback over the coming weeks, especially when ppl have actually played a few more serious attempts at clan wars. Be sure to give it time before (if at all) you release a revised version.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Though i got often spawnkilled. and often i was in the situation that i spawned and found no weapon, so i had to go into a fight only with smg. dunno if the weapon were picked up before or if the spawns were too far away from any powerful weapon.<br>
in general i agree with the other opinions that a second mag is needed. but i dont think that 4 shottioes are too much. but maybe delete the rpg ammo 8or is there a special reason for it?<br>

shotgun numbers is fine indeed<br>
<br>
definatley one more mag for sure, the one now is not difficult to get, but rather a nuisance to get off of without falling off, maybe second could be near second level health charger on the opposite side of the map, or right below that in the hallway<br>
<br>
maybe ar2 could be moved to one of the ledges near the smg nade. other than that great map<br>

	<div class="content">I had a proper look at the map and spawns and made overview where they are located to get a better understanding why there was allot of spawn kills resulting on this map.<br>
<a href="http://img3.imageshack.us/i/spawnsh.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/683/spawnsh.th.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
<br>
In general I find that they are bunch to close together a good experienced player would work this out and pouch in areas where they are concentrated mainly the right area and the top center.<br>
<br>
specific spawns I have a problem with centre one which is positioned right in the middle of a door way which is not a very practical place, you should not place spawns where players back is exposed.<br>
<br>
<br>
heres my suggestions <br>
<a href="http://img197.imageshack.us/i/spawnrev.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/7076/spawnrev.th.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
what I done is spread them out and removed some to reduce probability of spawn in that loctaion. I placed a spawn in caged crossbow area and added a spawn to the central area floor. I also moved the spawn next to the double health pack on top of the gray metal box. I also added a spawn in the central area on one of those ledges nearest to bridge.  <br>

anyway hope this helps</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Cartel has made a edit to their homemap after there was complaints that it was too unbalanced. I need some trained eyes to look over it and tell me if it is suitable for a 3v3 for competitive play. I have played it and im not too sure about it so give your opinion your more than welcomed. <br>

	<div class="content">yea the problem with the last one was that the rpg was given to much power over the map. Like there was to much suit or health in the rpg house. Plus as u said having direct access rpg with high ground just made it harder to attempt a attack on the house. Spawn points where not good and the top floor was not used at all.<br>
<br>
with this new revision they added ladder that is slightly out of view at rpg but i believe if u hear the ladder noise u could just as easy curve a rpg to it. They added a new path from the mag that was near the charger don't see what this adds to the map but i guess it so u can attack rpg from a different path. There some vents that have been added which i think is just random and looks out of place.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If we could start from scratch, I hope a majority wouldn't want to allow maps like powerhouse and frenzy. As it is, however, it's not so easy as to simply remove them when they actually being used by some clans. I believe that would just make the things worse.<br>
<br>
But just because there are already some bad maps allowed, doesn't mean we have to let new ones in. The new version seems better than the old but that's not saying I like it. If nothing else, it's yet another version of the map for players to learn.<br>
<br>
Maybe what I don't like with resident is that if you get to the rpg, you're already in a good position to use it. Dominating weapons shouldn't be too easy to get and certainly not easy to take to a good camping spot.<br>
<br>
The new version seems kind of cluttered. Less is more, if you see what I'm getting at...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well I said it on CU that this map is small and its not a good idea to provide launch platform for the rpg to kill guys below. They have provided new areas but as well they have left it exposed to the main area pretty much there is no cover from rpg. The vent that goes to grass area and and main area is a sign of poor mapping their reason for for adding it was to provide a escape route from the main area but u might as well put a hallway than a vent because it likely be killed before u can crouch and sprint thro unless u know who to bhop and fast crawl thro the vent which is very difficult to do if u got a guy shooting rpgs from the top at u. <br>
Anyway map is not being allowed into cu they submitted the map far to late for teams to learn the map. But do hope there is a more sensible version that will be mad of it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
This HL2DM level was designed as a mid 20th century abandoned lunatic asylum, using real locations in both England and the US as reference. <br>
<br>
  The level was built first and foremost with competitive game in mind, featuring close quarter areas and more opened ones, control points and choke points. <br>
It is large enough for 3v3, 4v4 and pubs while fast and properly connected, hopefully to do well for 1v1 and 2v2 matches as well.<br>
<br>
  The layout consists of two main areas connected with a long L-shaped hallway while several interconnections “criss-cross” between the different rooms. <br>
Of the two main halls one contains a Supercharger and is in proximity to several power weapons (AR2 + CB, Mag, Xbow and an RPG in the underground level) however is rather remote by design<br>
while the other main hall contains an AR2 + CB, SMG Nade, a Healthcharger and a Suitcharger in it. The AR2 and CB in the second hall are placed on a balcony, over watching the room. <br>
<br>
  The RPG in this map was designed hard to get while avoiding the use of “punishment” or timer systems; it is simply located at the end of a long underground hallway. <br>
There are two ways to get to it: one is through a floor break inside the Supercharger room, the other is a ladder at the farther end of the hallway. <br>
Two ways of getting out: one is the ladder and the other is prop-jumping back to the Supercharger room. <br>
Unfortunately for the player choosing this option, the only prop available is a prison bed which is poor for prop jumping further enforcing the purpose of the RPG design.<br>
<br>
  The two far ends of the map appear to be mainly connected by the long L-Shaped hallway, however the available interconnections make it redundant, or the REAL “secondary route” if you will. <br>
It does not contain any weapons / ammo you wouldn’t find elsewhere, apart perhaps from the one CB. Other than that, you will find in it frag grenades and a Crossbow. <br>
All pickups in the L-shaped hallway are on its upper level, a Lockdown style catwalk.<br>

I will be releasing the map primarily as a RC version to avoid renaming it as much as possible. Once the judges approve the current version I will post a DL link.<br>

5:42 AM - {EE}FRANK| R.I.P MIKE IN BOSTON: just to let you know..people are saying more weapons and that its wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy to big<br>
6:24 AM - {EE}FRANK| R.I.P MIKE IN BOSTON: we just had 8 players in and it was pretty good...and more people said that they couldnt find weapons that it needed more
</div></blockquote>

Map being "too big" can easily be remedied by a teleport and "needing more weapons" by simply placing more.<br>
let's not let this turn into milieu #2 and get some serious feedback going. i think the map can turn out great IF people give proper feedbacks.<br>

I think he was saying you should move the super charger and rpg so that the map would be a battle for either, so like if you were at super charger, you were risking giving someone else a chance at rpg.

	<div class="content">I finally had a chance to run around in it and here are my thoughts. I agree that the map needs more weapons and ammo. Mainly in some of the hallways. The map does seem big, but I think that it just has big rooms. Like the hallways and some of the rooms are just a lot larger then most maps being played right now. I think this is due to your L4D mapping <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">. Each room is big enough to defend from the hoard lol. I like the map though and I think that it's not a bad thing to be the size it is. It will force teams to stick together more. Adding some more weps and ammo will help quite a bit though I think. I also agree with what New Guy said. You need to give the map "zones" like on Lockdown. Force teams to work certain areas so rooms on the map aren't forgettable. Only problem I had with the actual map was that I had trouble seeing a lot of the weapons. This might of just been me not looking hard enough, but I thought that there were times when I ran over a weapon and I never even saw it sitting there lol. All and all a real doozy of a map man.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I like the map's size too. My only complaints are similar, it needs just a few more weapons. I was also thinking it can be hard at times to find the enemy, is it possible to make make some sort of security video TV in some of the hallways where you could have vision of the bigger rooms or maybe a security video room in that balcony? Also if I had one more thing to say, maybe mark out the supercharger just a bit more? For basically something that can make/break a game maybe make the glow of the supercharger area a bit more marked or something of the sort.<br>

I remember One Flew over the Cuckoos and all those security TV's everywhere that really add to the environment of a creepy hospital, but IDK sort of a ridiculous request to make.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">*More weps/pickups - easy. i'm on it.<br>
<br>
*To put an end to the "omg map is too big" thing.<br>
I've made screenshots of LD and Asylum in Hammer using the exact same zoom value. the maps are COMPLETELY the same size. (same goes for ALL the ROOMS in both maps, Sacrifist  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br>
<img src="http://eyeclan.net/backup/asylum/freaking_ld_and_asylum.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Think about Asylum as a LD cut in the middle and the bottom part pushed a bit to the side, making the general layout wider.<br>
Hope this concludes the map size debate. Asylum is not bigger, its just brighter and ceilings are taller giving the illusion of larger spaces.<br>
<br>
*Love the monitor idea. but the way this engine works is once a player is viewing an ingame camera showing a different part of the level he's in; the game will also render that other part as well as the part you're in at the time. In Source we occlude one area from another to keep frames playable therefore cams are killing performance because we've just stripped the map of all visual occlusion.<br>
Note how in bio and LA swot is using a very low-res cam showing a nothing shot. e.g. what you see through those monitors are pretty much empty areas with no details at all, definitely not heavy traffic junctions, hallways, etc. this unfortunately cannot be worked around. cams are so fucked up in this engine that in fact if you took away the cams from LA, bio and infinity these maps would immediately gain anywhere between 15% to 25% MORE frames. it's that bad.<br>
A possible solution: if you need to know if someone is in a certain room i can do that using indicator lights. i'll just need to know which areas need to be monitored and where the indicator lights should be placed. i'm not so sure this will really do what you're trying to get though.<br>
<br>
*As for the supercharger - could you perhaps explain "mark" a bit more? as it is now: the supercharger has indicator lights in and outside the room and another light above the doorway on the L hallway coming into the supercharger area. so i'm not sure..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i've gone through a lot of trouble removing weps / pickups from the path to prevent xbow shots getting caught in them. seems i've done a good job lol.. perhaps too good?<br>
<br>
Another thing. during production i've gone through the entire map with Con after he pointed out the fact it needed something to pick up every few feet and we've made sure this rule it met.<br>
<br>
So i think it might be best holding off on adding more weps/pickups for now until at least several people who learn the map come back with more solid feedbacks on the ACTUAL amount of wep/pickups in the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 <br>
There definitely is a more spacious feel and I like that. There are enough choke points and interesting areas to keep things going. Obviously it needs maybe 6 or more players to cook, but that's cool. When peeps started joining Warefare it cooked. <br>
<br>
I wasn't sure about that teleport in the vent shaft. Not a big deal. It's nice to have some indication that a tele is there. Oh, and I did get stuck on someone who was camping that little cubby where the info_teleport_destination is located. I'm pretty sure there is a push to help prevent that, but it happened anyway. Might have been bad timing on my part. xD<br>
<br>
I thought it was kinda weird that we could shoot rpg out of the center grating in the rpg area. I suppose that's intended to give rpg a chance to get out.</li></ul>

Frankly the 3v3's on asylum_b6 didnt go well for draft. The map produced the lowest scoring 3v3 rounds since I can remember. Quite simply...<br>
<br>
Hallways were too narrow, it was too easy to camp in RPG at the bottom, me and blas would sit there picking people off for almost 5 minutes straight, its almost impossible to retake the lower RPG if the camping person has good aim. The same complaint could be made for zeta but there are many more entrances to RPG to rush and retake it, there are only two for asylum, very small entrances you have to climb down or crouch into to retake the area. The time it takes to crouch or climb down to the area leads to an easy pick.<br>
<br>
It was a little too big overall, opponents had trouble finding eachother, and by then most of us knew the map. IDK quite honestly I don't foresee it in league match 3v3 unless the size is reduced, and major revamps are done with the RPG area.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I meant the upper hallways above the RPG. It's too easy to pick someone off from RPG area because of how narrow they are. It's almost insta kill because they have so little space to run around with.<br>
<br>
Also teleporters throughout the map *may* help, but I think you just need to resize it IMO. Also more access ways into the RPG could help also, but perhaps widen the grates so I can't camp off to the sides of the RPG lower area without almost any risk to myself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you have mag in the RPG area and ur just camping; well I mag you back, shoot bolts and bounce them since it's narrow and easy to do, or throw hand nades/orbs thru grate.  You cant throw hand nades thru there right now but I believe valar's going to make it so you can in the final vers.  Don't tell me you can't be magged back either like you know it for a fact.<br>

I personally loved the way the map played, and how in the hell are low scores a bad thing???  The map gives you a lot of breathing room unlike almost any of the other comp maps these days.<br>
<br>
And also since you're down on the bottom with a mag, well fuck I'll just come down there from the entrance that's right by the RPG spawn and attack you that way!  And it's not like the people HAVE to try and kill you down in RPG area either lol, hell I'll just go charge up some 200 get orbs and smg nades and play it slow.<br>

what i think should be done is the competition organizers, like in previous years, should see the map through until it's reached a desirable state.<br>
i don't believe there can be a one version that will please all but most definitely we can fix the major problems and fine tune the others.<br>
<br>
My thoughts at this stage (please comment):<br>
<br>
1) map size. i don't honestly see how we can remove 30-50% of the map without basically ruining it. on the other hand, a system of teleports can be easily done. this will make the map a lot faster to move through and essentially smaller.<br>
2) RPG - the initial idea with the RPG was while you still have an RPG in the map it's not as dominating as it is in other maps. that idea failed because it was poorly executed (the grate issue) so the question is:<br>
do we keep the original idea and make it work or - we can choose to open the RPG, adding more access routes to it.<br>
regarding the grate: having players and physics go through the grate you might as well simply remove the grate altogether. i'm not against the idea, just clarifying. is this something you'd like to see?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No matter what you do to this map it won't be high scoring map like bio and I don't see how that should be the mapper's problem. It just means that CU system on the overall winner just limits the map that would be used in league by the teams. It does not mean at all that it is not a good map or suited to competitive play. Just saying<br>

I don't think you will have to remove 30-50% more like 20% should do it. What I found was when playing it was that most of the action what taking place in the prison hall and away from that giant hall. May be try and trim away areas that see less action and try and focus around the prison halls. I do like the map for it breathing room but it so easy to sneak up on people especially with no sound when bhopping. <br>
<br>
On rpg don't remove the grate good thing about the grate is that is forces you down a channel to get the rpg rather than just dropping onto it. But if you want to increase access to the lower tunnel I suggest you make a small hole in the grate to fall through in the second grate away from rpg. As well it either make it so both rpg and grenades can go through grate or not at all like caverns.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

In the RPG area there is a connector of solid cover ceiling, the area between the two grates where no one could get me and I had the RPG BTW.

<br>
When I camped there I didn't die once for over 5 minutes. I shot one person trying to climb down the ladder with RPG, shot one person two times trying to crawl through the jammed doorway and did not encounter any effective SMG nade use that could get near me camping in this spot.<br>
<br>
IDK we had 7 players in the server that night (one spec), not a single person wanted to a second round on it. I think it needs something, but as it stands its not going to be a map chosen by anybody at this point because we also found it to be low scoring and boring.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
When I camped there I didn't die once for over 5 minutes. I shot one person trying to climb down the ladder with RPG, shot one person two times trying to crawl through the jammed doorway and did not encounter any effective SMG nade use that could get near me camping in this spot.<br>
<br>
IDK we had 7 players in the server that night (one spec), not a single person wanted to a second round on it. I think it needs something, but as it stands its not going to be a map chosen by anybody at this point because we also found it to be low scoring and boring.</div></blockquote>

I'm sorry but i just don't get it. first <strong class="text-strong">you</strong> gave the map 1st place at the competition <strong class="text-strong">you</strong> hosted, then <strong class="text-strong">you</strong> <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=5258&amp;p=73502#p73502" class="postlink">praised it here</a> and <a href="http://www.clans-united.net/index.php?site=forum_topic&amp;topic=7731&amp;type=ASC&amp;page=2" class="postlink">on the CU forums</a> to no end. But then, you play one real match on it and all of a sudden you bury it without second thought. wouldn't it make more sense to give some more serious <strong class="text-strong">constructive</strong> suggestions instead of this once over?<br>
I don't mean no disrespect but i just don't see the competition board being professional about it. You wanted new competitive maps and you've found the one you guys felt it was the best. now, it's time to fine tune things. No winning map has EVER released without constructive help. None. I shouldn't be running after the board for inputs for 2 weeks and then get this. That's just wrong.<br>

I think walking around a map and having a close look by even a experience gamer would not give a idea on how well it would play out in a match. speaking more my self I do like it I found the breathing space quite refreshing to collect my self and then go on hunting and making my way to places of action. <br>
<br>
I list what I think can be improved as said it just need streamlining no drastic changes.<br>
1. As valium said there is a blind spot in the tunnel. You could solve thing by connecting the two grates as just on long curved grate. (keep in mind I am not a mapper not a clue how easy this can be done)   <br>
2. Make it so no rpg or even grenades can go through the grate. I have changed my mind on this since I believe this will give incentive for the player to get out of the tunnel to use rpg. Plus looking at the grate it makes sense that a rocket should not go through it.<br>
3. Add a hole in the second grate as mentioned in my previous post.  <br>
4. working on this one....<br>
<br>
Problem with this map is it is complex and it does take time for players know their way around a map. hl2dm players are too used to simple big open spaced maps. give it time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm a strictly competitive player, I can offer advice in the way of how it played, but as a non-mapper I can't really give suggestions on how you can fix them. I did advocate the map to be played, but now that its been played it didnt pan out as well as the map ran when we did loose scrims with no serious consequences to them. I also disagree with airfusion being more complex, the map is almost entirely in the open, you have vision of your opponents almost at <span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span> times during scrims/league matches. With this map so far the vision is not there, its more of a guessing game where they are and where you guess they are I found the opponents where never there, thus the low scoring.<br>

You have to realize that players are not familiar with the map still. Im sure Valar will need to make changes, but you guys should really give this one a chance to grow and work with Valar to make the map more streamline to a competitors liking.

I need constructive criticism not rating.<br>
As an admin you should be able to handle someone being honest. In all previous mapping competitions the judges, AFTER calling the winners, went ahead and made sure all issues and bugs were fixed and ONLY then released the map to the public.

ahh now i see why it's so problematic. So it not individual bars the game treats it as a mesh. Okay now I understand if you prevent rpg you have to stop bullets, well in that case leave it as it is by preventing bullets and no way to shot the guy in the tunnel there is nothing to prevent a team from gaining a lead and then camping in the tunnel covering all exits seeing out the rest of the game. I do find this strange I swear there are maps with grates that allow bullets but not rpg emm octagon springs to mind near the pipes ar2. <br>
<br>
On the map being complex it is I would compare it to powerhouse which is a in door environment which does take time to know the layout of the map. Reason why I said it is complex is that you got three levels in the map the tunnel,ground floor, then 1st floor as well the you got small rooms that fairly close together as well as interconnecting corridors. Problem is a player can end up circulating in a loop if you miss a exit which is what happened to me in 1st round.        <br>
<br>
what would help is to post a top down view of the map and please label out key point of importance like rpg, chargers, and teleporters. From there I and other would have a better idea of the layout of the map and see what can be done to improve the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I used the term "mesh" as to describe the entity in Hammer - Displacement, as oppose to Brush - a Solid.<br>
The RPG shooting through the grate is fixed by creating the grate from brushes instead of a displacement. once this is done the rule regarding the shoot-through metal grate / bars texture will set in and nothing else will go through besides bullets.<br>
This will reinstate the original idea where once you've gone down to get the RPG you will have to get out since you can be shot at from above. You can of course shoot back but anyone risking going down there doesn't do so just to have a shoot out at a disadvantage point.<br>
<br>
Back to the topic of map size:<br>

There are several ways in which you can cut down size or work around it but at this point i'm far from certain this is even called for.<br>

Usually I agree with the things you say Chem, but all this talk from a person who AFAIK doesnt even play hl2dm anymore, nor did you even try this in a match yet. Why don't you actually try it in a real match before you talk about it. There can be low scoring maps that can be intense, but this map did not draw any feeling of intensity for any of us that match. There were no areas that any of us felt drawn to dominate, the opposing team didnt even need to come kill me at RPG, they just stayed away and won anyway without the RPG. Typically in RPG maps you should feel compelled to dominate or retake the RPG area but the map was so big there was no need to.<br>

wasnt a shot at you Val.  and yes, you are correct in saying i dont play much any more.  prolly 45 mins in the last 7-8 months.  i took a break cause i was taking programming classes and just didnt have the time.  now i have just been into other games.  BUT with that said, i love this community and would never just totally take off.  ill get back into playing at some point.  the game is one thing, and the ppl here are another.  i have a lot of close friends here and care about a lot of ppl.  valar is a very close friend of mine and it just drives me insane when he gets shit on.  he submits a map to the contest, gets first place and tons of praise then after one week of draft he gets a bomb dropped on him.  im not gonna go into this schpeel again, we have all heard it.  and this isnt just about valar, its about everybody that tries to do something for the community and gets the shit end of the stick.  take dallas for instance, he tried to run a league for us and got nothing but headaches.  we distroyed CAL, yes i know it disbanning was out of our hands but in all seriousness that was just like somebody dropping a missle on the titanic an hour after it started sinking.  holy is trying to put together a league and has to spend countless hours researching hacks because we cant even be honest with each other.  is gotten to the point where its more than "this is why we cant have nice things".  we almost at the "this is why we cant have anything".  whatever, i have to go to work and really dont feel like pointing out more examples, we all konw what they are anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Usually I agree with the things you say Chem, but all this talk from a person who AFAIK doesnt even play hl2dm anymore, nor did you even try this in a match yet. Why don't you actually try it in a real match before you talk about it. There can be low scoring maps that can be intense, but this map did not draw any feeling of intensity for any of us that match. There were no areas that any of us felt drawn to dominate, the opposing team didnt even need to come kill me at RPG, they just stayed away and won anyway without the RPG. Typically in RPG maps you should feel compelled to dominate or retake the RPG area but the map was so big there was no need to.<br>
<br>
I hope b7 is released before the next draft starts,maybe you can join us to actually see what we're talking about.</div></blockquote>

<br>
you had one round that was low, and the next was a little below average.  If you are winning in powerhouse and lose the rpg, you don't need to goto rpg<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't get the stance you are taking, you know Valar is willing to work with anyone to improve his maps.  He can't just throw in the towel and say it's to big though,  that thought really got to valar.  I know I get pissed when i spent a lot of time working on something and someone comes along and just says what i spent months on is shit and I should give up.<br>

The second round you saw was caverns, we had a unaminous vote of 6-0 to not play it a second round. My anger was partly directed at the 10+ people who complained to me that night of how bad it played yet no one else is here offering advice of why they thought it was bad.<br>
<br>
Part of my critique was echoing the sentiments of these ten people, too campish in many areas, low scoring, RPG was too easy hold ect. Like I said though I'm done giving advice, if no one else is going to come and try to offer advice and consti is the one advocating leaving the map basically as it is minus the grate change then leave the map as it is and be done ^^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I love it cause this map (and ethic) i get like 35 fps (10 fps more than usual) and theres a lot of flow in the map. IDK why people complain about it, its not THAT big, its perfect in my opinion. And if people are annoying by the rpg thing, maybe you could make a normal asylum and a rpg one but idk. People were complain about the lack of kills in a scrims?<br>

49 - 59 seems ok no?<br>

	<div class="content">Just ran around B8 Valar. Nice work. A few notes (without screenies because it's Friday and I must do some stuff). In the shower room, there is a crate <br>
which is halfway melted into one of the benches.<br>
Also, I don't like that the benches have collisions turned off. I would put player clips(like over the lockers) so you feel like they are there, but don't impede.<br>
Next, the target decals......Many of them disappear into the walls a bit. Could use some tweaking.<br>
And the sprite plants.... They just seem to be unnecessary. As you pass a few of them, they rotate unrealistically into the walls and half way disappear.The map would not suffer a tick without them.<br>
And, in the shower room, and the other big hall, I feel like there is some z-axis which could be taken advantage of, but again, that is just my opinion.<br>
And finally, there is a second floor with a bunch of doors on either side. This whole corridor seems a bit anti-climactic. I was walking around and I remembered some old comedy movies where they  were chasing each other through many doors in a hallway and where they would come out did'nt make any sense(<a href="https://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/benny-hill-hallway-chase/6784b9453f3f25a1871b6784b9453f3f25a1871b-203481023359?q=Benny%20Hill%20Hallway%20chase&amp;FROM=LKVR5&amp;GT1=LKVR5&amp;FORM=LKVR" class="postlink">http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/ ... &amp;FORM=LKVR</a>, but it was funny(I know the video was a poor choice, but you have no idea how hard it was to find an example!). How about a series of teleporters which would accomplish the same thing? Could add some flavor to that area.<br>
This map is, as are all of your maps, stellar, and with a little tweaking could be freaking awesome. Remember, I bow to your mapping skillz, so don't be upset by my opinions, because that's all they are.<br>
I would play this as is anywho!.<br>

	<div class="content">that's fine man. i always appreciate your notes. however keep in mind this map is not necessarily a pub and is focused on competitive more than ffa, as such there are some excruciating tradeoffs  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> .<br>
all is different not in b9 apart from the "second floor with a bunch of doors on either side" which i assume you're referring to the curved hallway. firstly, it doesn't need to be climactic it needs to follow a simple function and that is to connect the two parts of the map as fast and efficient as possible. if you're referring to its visual aspect, then i'm more than opened to suggestion - please, feel free hitting me with your ideas.<br>
also, z axis i can take advantage of in the RPG and Locker rooms - how so? you don't explain.<br>

	<div class="content">The RPG-ammo hazard did not work. <br>
I hit the switch the purposefully tried to go into the fan; I got sucked up and stayed against the fan for about two seconds but did not die. <br>
And the shadows you were going for did not work either <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
Granted I only tested it once, it still will need some tweaking, however the concept turned out a lot better than I originally anticipated; it's just  a bit buggy at the moment.<br>
<br>
I still think the maximum number of indestructible props should stay at 7.<br>
With that at 7, the number of volatile (explosive) props should be 5-9, as well as the non-volatile should be in the 5-9 range. <br>
Considering how big and drawn out this map is, both of the indestructible prop values should be more 7-9. <br>
<br>
This map has a good original theme that seems to be an amalgamation of caverns' RPG vs SC and lockdown-like aesthetics, only Valar seems to want both sides to be balanced in terms of weapons and spam. Combine that with Blur's idea of making the armor and health on the RPG side harder to gather, and thereby making the RPG harder to camp, and I think we will have a very nice competitive teamplay map. <br>
Too bad the game is dead and broken.<br>
Since Valar seems to be making a map that has the resources, weapons, and props split down the middle, the indestructible props placement should slightly lean toward the SC side to balance the 300hp opportunity, and the volatiles should lean toward the RPG side furthering the idea of it being hard to camp and control. By "slightly" I mean to suggest the SC side have 4 props, 4 barrels, and 5 boxes, whereas the RPG side have 3 props, 5 barrels, and 4 boxes. <br>
<br>
I really hope you decide to stay within those ranges, Valar, and if people say an area is too "barren" you try rearranging prop-placement rather than shoving more in there. <br>
If people say an area "looks" barren and "empty" I am sure you can conjure-up some spectacular eye-wonder that does not interfere with game-play. <br>
This map is now loaded with weapons; the 3 mags and 4 bows do raise and eyebrow but are balanced on both sides, and this makes the map much more viable for a 4v4. <br>
The room where you added the 4th bow may need its ceiling raised to make the room 35-50% taller; I foresee vertical combat being awkward, but that remains to be seen. <br>
The 5 orbs work, if blast wants more I'll fucking stab him. <br>
<br>
All of this needs a fuckload of playtesting though, and whatever the overwhelming ideas turn out to be are the ones you will have to defer to and accommodate, Valar. <br>
It's still an awesome map, well done once again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If possible please play it on draft and to outside-of-the-league scrims because that would help nailing everything in a matter of days.<br>

What the fucking cunt-shit? <br>
<br>
Marking the spawns visible is the best and FASTEST way to get feedback on them, and it makes it easier for people, who are already resistant to change, to learn the NEW map. <br>
<br>
But sure, right, yeah. <br>
Make it harder for new players and old-schoolers alike to get up to speed on this map. <br>
<br>
But sure, right, yeah. <br>
Make it so you have to no-life and practice a map in order to learn the spawns and nuances and see how much more growth this game will experience; we all know no growth will happen whatsoever, but digging the hole even deeper just does not make sense. <br>
<br>
But sure, right, yeah. <br>
Slow down both the process of this map getting better as well as players getting better at it .<br>

Just made sense to have them in front of you in order to see and analyze them rather than having to open up hammer to get a broad/objective look at them and how they should be placed. <br>

It would have made the feedback on Boshed's Helix go MUCH faster with the judges just needing to "map dm_helix" it rather than play a scrim or suicide a lot and hope the randomizer BS got them to every spawn-point within a reasonable amount of time. <br>

*Ahem* - "Not."<br>
<br>
Clearly you have not played huge nerds such as TLC and Poor_Billy as much as I thought you have; either that, or you wore that cute fitted hat a bit too low on your brow when you play/scrim and are unable to see wtf is happening right in front of you.  <br>
<br>
Spawn camping is not wrong, for it is deathmatch. People did it in q3; people do it in this much less balanced POS game. <br>
Thing is, in LD and LA you cant have line of sight to a whole lot of spawn points at one time. <br>
I am not saying their spawns are perfect, but they are pretty good considering what is there to work with. <br>
<br>
I have no expertise on spawn points. <br>
If I did I would rant about it like i do everything else with an authoritative attitude. <br>
It's the 'roids that Alex says I am on, I guess.  <br>
<br>
But I did tell Valar to put the icons on the map in order to speed up feedback on them. <br>
Feedback from intelligent competitive-oriented people like Ko-Tao. As well as people that know some kind of shit on the subject, but also others who potentially could have very valid input but do not want to open hammer or nerd-practice the map. <br>
I also told Valar that the competitive community would likely cry foul at the idea, and he may need to take them out. <br>
And it seems you/they did, and so Valar was forced to abide. <br>
<br>
Oh, and by-the-way, so long as a mapper is still around, a map is always in "test" stages. <br>
People will continue to argue about this map. Then they will come to a collective decision and opportunities will be there for Valar to improve upon his map. <br>
<br>
With that precedent, let me make my case:<br>
<br>
The reason I am arguing to keep the markings in the map is so that nerd-ing/nolife-ing is not rewarded with bow kills on spawn points. The locations of spawn points is inforamtion that should be disclosed to every single player as fast as possible, for it levels the playing field (albeit very slightly) for everyone involved. <br>
<br>
It's basic shit, these spawn points. <br>
Why should teams have to put in extra hours of scrimming just to have the ability to learn basic shit? <br>
People will know the spawns regardless, and you cant stop them from "camping them like crazy." <br>
The question would be: how long it would take for all players to learn this information? <br>
<br>
I say, FuckingRightNao.<br>
<br>
With the icons present, the more talented team will still win the match, and it is open for anyone and everyone to have the ability to exert their control of the map by raping the spawner. <br>
TLC has not played asylum as much as I, and if he is able to kill me, he should be able to immediately look at a spawn while restocking health/armor/ammo and have the opportunity to rape me as I rush a respawn in an attempt to 'nade him and finish him off. <br>
Just the way it should be. <br>
<br>
Deathmatch - do you get it?<br>
<br>
The aspects of a "pr0-style" game that players should be expected/required to practice is how to control a particular map, advanced movement and speed, aim, and proper placement of spam. Why the fuck do you have to add in spawn points to that list? <br>
It already takes enough of a players time to become proficient at the qualities listed. <br>
All this in a game that is NOT competition worthy. Lawl.<br>
<br>
I still do enjoy the "barely positive" aspects of hl2dm, but an exciting and balanced version of it will not happen on this engine. <br>
Perhaps not in this community either.<br>
<br>
The spawn rape will happen regardless if their is fucking icons on the spawn or not; it's just having them in there makes it fair for nerds and non-nerds alike. <br>
<br>
If you do not like spawn-killing Dal, please put a TF2 logo on your hat and move on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

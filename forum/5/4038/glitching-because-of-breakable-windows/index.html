	<div class="content">I used to have this problem, maybe a year ago.  Then I moved house and got a different connection.  Not saying that is the issue, but i can't honestly say what it was because the problem simply disappeared over time.  <br>
<br>
<br>
These are a few educated guesses:<br>
<br>
- I could suggest using a different window texture.<br>
- Maybe edit the glass texture .vmt and remove the $surfaceprop "glass", or change it to $surfaceprop "nodecal"<br>
- If it is a LAN server, change to internet server, if it's a windows server, change to linux.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">this could be the same problem that fearsome ran into when he was making one of the lockdown revisions. It related to the way he set the breakable window in hammer if I am not mistaken. He then found away to fix it, Im not a mapper but you might be able to figure out what he did by looking at the windows in lockdown_r2, r3 and r5 and see what the differences are, or if someone knows they can post it here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

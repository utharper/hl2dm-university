Well, I see a prop lover feeling the lack of props in the map. I personally don't mind much, barrels have been useful on my last fights there, but now that I think of it, all the props in that map end up breaking... it's a one chance shot...<br>
Maybe something more "solid" could be added.. not much though, as it was said the map is small and even more with the teleport.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i am not a fan of a map riddled with props. an even balance of shit to throw around is fine by me. i like the fact that a prop can be an equalizer in times of desperation, sure. the gravity gun is OF COURSE what makes this game. <br>
it takes a certain type of map though, to get away with not having alot of shit to toss around. lostvillage and lostarena are really great examples.<br>
<br>
i like the balance alot of the good maps in dm have. some are mag fest, some are cball fest, some are throw props around fest. usually the throw props around fest is an after thought though, the way i see it. for example, your playin it out with a dood, going back in forth in a tight situation. you unload on your weaps, choosing the ones that fit the area and situation the best, but your opponent keeps pressing on. it isnt until one of you find that lone radiator laying on the ground, followed by a well placed toss to the others pinky toe, turning around the kill.<br>
props can also make this game super unpredictable, one of the many reasons why the loyals keep coming back.<br>
on maps, weapons spawn in the same spot. nothing really changes with that, but solid, indestructible props can change location. your hopin down the mag-hall, only to find those little shards of rock you usually find only in the lockdown bathroom being hurled at your dirty rebel skullcap.<br>
gameplay elements like that make the use of props cool. theres seriously a spot for every bit of em.<br>
every map should have em, just in moderation. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

True, lostvillage (especially when played without rpg) caters for people who want to 'strip down' the game, making it more suitable for their style of play. Seems to me this is often players with a CS background, and they probably feel more at home in maps with a layout like lostvillage. They're not used to weapons like grav gun and rpg.<br>
<br>
If we want to get even more people over from CS, these lostvillage type of maps are probably good for us. Not saying lostarena is one of them with teleport and barrel, but the lack of props (and rpg) and the general layout should make if popular amongst CS noobs as well as die hard HL2DM fans.<br>

<br>
I do agree with a you a bit, but why not throw in a couple persistent props, so that the CS:S folks can experience getting bashed in the face with a radiator in an environment that seems somewhat familiar to them?  Easing them into the game is cool, but showing them how to not piss on their leg is a bit much, IMO.  That being said, I love the way crates break...and even more when a face other than mine causes them to shatter =).<br>

Yeah, agreed, it's always a balance.<br>
<br>
And although there are the CS-map conversions they're not anywhere near being as common as lostvillage and lostarena.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

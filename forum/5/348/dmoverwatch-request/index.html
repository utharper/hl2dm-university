	<div class="content">could someone skilled at mapping do a "revised" ( or whatever) version of overwatch. I would love that map if it had more suit, health, weapons, and was a bit more balanced.<br>
So, would anybody do me the favor of making a new version of dm_overwatch =D ?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">adding items and weapons is very easy.  (assuming there are no problems decompiling  and recompiling this map it should not be a problem for anyone to do.)<br>
<br>
I rarely play overwatch so I by no means know the gameplay and flow of the map well.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps you or someone who knows this map inside and out could explain what needs to be added / changed?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I actually like the current version because it plays so differently than other maps, you really gotta work hard to keep your health up.<br>
<br>
I think the plan is to make a fixed one for CAL, but that will just be bug fixed afaik.<br>
<br>
Every modification of overwatch I have seen has ruined it. A more balanced pickup layout might work, but it would have to be well thought out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Same for me.<br>
It's true that you gotta work hard to keep life up. It's much harder than other maps in that sense.<br>
I don't mean to fill the map with lot's of stuff, just as u said, to fix it's problems, improve fps, and just fill it with a bit more life, and maybe more weapons.  :roll:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i always wondered how two dm_overwatch maps put back to back  or one reversed with the rpg facing each other, might be cool for team play.  The version with a charger and 357 on the top feels so wrong. One whore for the next at least the rpg runs out quick.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Before / If i fix it for CAL, ill take a vote and see how many competitive players want it upgraded with more pickups, altered props, a supercharger etc., and how many just want the bugs fixed with the rest left as is.<br>
<br>
Tbh, the map doesnt see much play anymore except on low-skill pubs, and thats not due so much to the clipping errors as to the fact that far better control map options exist, such as zeta. A full remake might be just what overwatch needs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

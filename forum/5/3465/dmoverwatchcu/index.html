	<div class="content">what we done map is similar to lockdown and that been edited countless times. As far as overwatch which same as lockdown comes from single player should be fine to edit since all we doing is giving it extra pair a legs to run longer since in its original states it dyeing with all that's wrong with it. As I see it we don't need to ask permission if it comes with the game especially when the material it self is recycled stuff it owned by the community that plays the game and im sure valve has no problem with that.

<br>
sry val miss your point. I fully agree with other maps such as you do should not be edited with out permission it did not come with the game and can not be claimed as property of the community. Adding maps to cu that has that been edited with out permission is not added to the maplist and thanks for jelly for informing that the mapper did not, we have replaced it with the original in the maplist. We are not responsible if a mapper don't ask permission and do not support it by not adding it to our map list.<br>
It clearly against our rules to add maps that have been edited with out permission.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well that more of a saying we use in aesthetics in design. If the shape looks like crap you might as well start again.<br>
<br>
But this is a map and its more of a point of performance and functionality than looks. So in that sense polishing as you delicately put it does not apply. Because in any design there always room for improvement when it comes to efficiency where in this case of a map would be said playability.<br>
<br>
You may hate and I my self have no fondness of it but it a classic iconic map of this game just like lockdown it came with the game and will for ever be associated with it. So no harm in improving a map such as this, anything would be better than the original state it was.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i personally don't hate OW. i think improving it is next to impossible and given the way it's designed it can never be optimized. but, having said that, anyone who's trying to improve it is obviously trying to do good so that works for me m8.<br>
As for me, i was only wanting to make sure we're not looking at a new wave of custom maps rip fest in CU to which you kindly replied back is not the case.<br>
after that, the comment about Build New Maps...comes from the heart and wasn't intended to offend you, CU or any anyU else...just my personal opinion we, as a community, should move on and abandon the old comfortable pile of stock maps/ old HLDM revisions and look at the sheer volume of new works made in the last few years for HL2DM by HL2DM players. a lot of work has been done here and people insisting on playing old, outdated, hardly ever optimized for online play is verging pathetic. and i know you'll agree with me here.<br>
NONE of the old maps would have passed ANYONE's judgment as a new map TODAY. be it the lack of optimization, unbalanced gameplay, or simply the fact the amount of mapping and game errors in them would be enough. this goes for all maps done until the end of 04 including stock maps and maps that won Valve competitions. two maps only stand out in this list and they are LD and Avalon. both have great gameplay but suffer from major design issues and are laden with errors. apart from those there's Lost_Village which is an old revision. i personally have nothing against it apart from the fact its old and has better alternatives out there. that alone warrants reevaluation. and if that's not enough i'll say it again - this same exact map, presented this day would not have passed anyone's judgment. so this is also a question of making a good call when looking at a map be it old or new. that's up for grabs really.<br>
Again, not to offend or dismay anybody but truth to be told : this game has evolved through the years by people playing it and those people found and developed new ways of playing this game. all this has to result in a shift of style in mapping and maps designs. That shift has already started and is evident in many newer maps out there.<br>
<br>
I'd appreciate this message finds its way to the CU community. perhaps some will find is refreshing  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

Wouldn't bother wasting your time mate. Too many people there who are convinced that we should adapt to the faults of old stock maps.<br>
<br>
This is what a player said about the CU edit of dm_overwatch:
<blockquote><div><cite>[SA.fr]_kevinz wrote:</cite>
You don`t edit them to simply remove bugs or to improve performances and nor because it is players request to edit them, this is not true. You edit them because you`re bad players on them, it`s too difficult because you don`t even try to learn how to play on them. This is pathetic thinking at his best. Not something a good or sportsmanship player or team would do.</div></blockquote>

As far as I know about 6 spawns have been added and the spawn directly below RPG (near the 2 smg nades) has been removed making the chances of being spawn killed reduced which is probably the best you can do with this map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm seeing a lot of maps recently and most are from beginner mappers and wanted to throw a few minor tips for them in the hope it will help them grasp some of the ideas in level design...<br>
<br>
1) Most importantly - THINK ! THINK ! THINK ! Think BEFORE you start working. Think WHILE you're mapping and THINK HARD when you THINK you're done with the map: what is the gameplay like? What is the movement flow? DOES it have a gameplay? DOES it have flow of movement at all?<br>
<br>
2) Realism - Even Killbox which are not "real" venues can and should LOOK realistic. this is very important as we may find that even if it has nothing to do with gameplay the LOOK of think makes one FEEL something. you either FEEL you're in a room, hall, corridor, hangar, warehouse that makes sense or you don't. The scales of things are a factor or RELATION. e.g. the relation of a catwalk to the walls and floor...the distance from them. a longer catwalk can be wider than a shorter one and so on...things can be made to make sense to one eyes. Many times the use of textures are a map's bane...or a map's highlight. Depends...how much THOUGHT went into the process.<br>
<br>
3) Thinking - many times beginners and advanced mappers a like fall in the deep pit of their Thinking process. Many times one would be so involved into the process or in love with the design of him map that he may lose sight of the OVERALL point of view.<br>
So - Thinking - means, looking at things in a broader sense. sometimes, looking too close at something makes you over focused on pettiness, or feel something is out of place when in the broader sense it isn't. so always see things of a broader / or higher standpoint.<br>
<br>
4) Design should always follow a Function - what is this item doing here? Is it a design (detail) item? Is it a gameplay related item (weapon, ammo, catwalk, piece of floor, door, hole in a wall etc..) ? What does it do and how easy it is to use it? How fast can you take advantage of a lift if it's crammed behind two thousands props or walls...<br>
<br>
5) All maps have choke points - better decide where YOU want your choke points and not let Chance call the shot. a Choke point can be a door connection to an important part of the map. a spot that holds a powerful weapon like a MAG or RPG, a combine ball spawner is a known choke point in killboxes for example. an RPG spot is usually a choke point in ALL maps. Think about the construction of those areas. How fast and how easy it is to get in and out of.<br>
<br>
6) Lighting - Good lighting makes a map playable and easy on the eyes and it doesn't matter if the lighting scheme is rather dark, heavily lit or mildly lit. <br>
Two most important things you need to keep in mind about lighting: A. Lighting exist to enable people to SEE. And B. Lighting makes people FEEL.<br>
Lighting that is laid out too evenly throughout a map or a certain area might feel a bit pale and not interesting. On the other hand, patches of lighting many times feel and behave more realistic.<br>
<br>
7) Spawn points - spawning a player in the middle of a heavily battled area is not too clever as ppl will die as soon as they spawn, making your map less cool for people to play. always better to find a shaded, protected or semi protected spot for a spawn point. Also mind where you player is facing. Don’t want to have them spawn facing a wall or window <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
9) Cubemaps -learn about them and use this wisely. Cubemaps imitate real life in the sense of light transition and reflections to and on the player. a good placement of Cubemaps determins how realistic that aspect of your map is. Also, many textures have specular features and reflect light, many models do also...a map without Cubemaps will show all those as ugly silver-grey. Unattractive, boring, not professional. Use cubemaps.<br>
<br>
10) Inspiration - if you run our of ideas: LEAVE. Don’t rape the map. Look for inspiration on the net, in other maps...in dreams and in movies...Creativity is an elusive power. Be nice to it and it will be nice to you. You cannot command it or foretell it. Doing so will only render self-beating and thoughts like: "ah crap, I’m no good at this. I better stop".<br>

	<div class="content">Holy Cow, now that's what I'm talking about.<br>
Here I found what I couldn't find in the common tutorials out there.<br>
Anyways, I'm gonna rape my map and start from zero, but THINKING more instead of doing anything and trying to "patch it up".<br>

	<div class="content">Ok so I have been drawing out an idea for a map on paper.  And I have been looking at it and THINKING, adding, changing and looking at it and thinking some more, etc.  Its a classical style map, so now if I wanted to start trying to build this in hammer, what would be the best way to start?  At one end then go across the map or (this would be more logical to me) start with the center structure and expand out from that?  I suppose it varies depending on the map?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think that's more a matter of what you think in person, what suits you best. But what I do when i'm mapping, is that I start by making the walls, floors and ceilings etc. I get the map area finsihed first. And then i work from level to level. If I have a level that's my center or so to say ground part. Ie not basement nor 2nd, 3rd floor etc. <br>
<br>
When I got the maparea limited by it's walls I start by adding details. Doorways, windows, stairs, ladders and so on. <br>
<br>
After I done that i can start thinking about the weapon placement, spawns, props etc.<br>
<br>
Now you have a perfectly playable map gaming wise. Maybe it makes your eyes bleed.. I would like to add that having some diffrent textures and some simple lightning should be added just so you get a feel of a map and not a fullbright stone brick map.<br>
<br>
You're ready for playtesting. When you think you're done with tweaking, make it nice. Lightning and details.<br>
To do it after the tweaking is done you might save some time by not doing something you won't need. Maybe you want to add some extra parts etc and they don't fit in and you have to re do all of your work :/<br>
<br>
That's my few cents. I'm not so experienced but this is how I work and I think it works just fine.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

On top of what Valar has posted, read and understand this, it's a must for anything beyond aim_arena :<br>

In it you'll find a great many tips to avoid having a poorly-performing map. For example, you asked where to start building; bear in mind that it will keep your vis cuts cleaner if you can build at least some of your divisions along the highlighted 1024 lines. And I remember something about a weapons bug in hl2dm if your map has an accessible area at 0 0 0</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

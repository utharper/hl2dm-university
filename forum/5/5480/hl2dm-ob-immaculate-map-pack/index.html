	<div class="content">Since all Pre OrangeBox maps look and perform pretty bad and many are broken or half broken (not to mention not making ANY use of the slew of new features in the current engine) i've decide to take on a project of revamping and re-compiling all stock and custom maps and release in several map packs.<br>
<br>
The custom maps i will include will initially be those <strong class="text-strong">i</strong> think should make the cut and <span style="text-decoration:underline">i'm opened to suggestions</span>:<br>
<br>
If anyone thinks a certain map should be included in the project please post the name of the map and if info available; the author as well. if i don't have that map it will be up to that person suggesting it to provide a DL link.<br>
Some maps will not be included in this like Octagon for example for technical reasons - i just can't be arsed with such a huge although amazingly done map.<br>
I want to make it clear this project does not regard or claim authoring rights or claim permissions. in simple words - i don't care about permissions since i'm not going to put my name in anywhere or benefit from this other than enjoy them on my servers. the idea is to have a working set of maps that are making full use of the current engine and that are compatible with it as well as removing any broken entities / functionalities from maps that didn't make the port in one piece.<br>

So are you just going to fix the ones that dont work at all?? I would think you may have more issues then originally be decompiling some of them, but most maps do well with a decompile. Im just curious what your actual plans are. You just planning to decomp and then recompile, rebuild cubemaps and make sure they work? Or are you planning to decomp, optimize it more, fix lighting and other obvious issues, recompile in ldr and hdr, rebuild cubemaps, make sure it works, then re release?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think its better then overwatch, but both are terrible. Btw, Im well aware you can just decomp it with vmex lol. I assumed you would ask him for the vmf though. Isnt he still in tsgk? After thinking it over, Id rather work on my map then mess with caverns lol. I will help you out with some older maps though if you want. Optimizing, fixing lights, cubemapping and recompiling isnt that big of deal. I do worry a little for you though, as some of those older maps are not optimized for shit and wont compile well unless you damn near rebuild them. Ive decomped older maps and was amazed they would even compile lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im not surprised. You are like me when it comes to mapping. You cant handle seeing shitty brushwork, errors, leaks, and other shoddy ass work. Everytime I decomp an older dm map to look at it, it rather has tons of things that make me cringe, or it was done by someone that knows wtf they are doing. In dm, the better built maps (that are played a lot) are rare imo. So, yes, you are going to have your hands full. I'd love to split the load with you on this, but I just dont have the damn time to help you out much right now. Best bet is to start with the most played maps and go from there I guess.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Would be cool if someone could make biohazard run for everyone asap as it's an often played map in Europe at least. Can't live without mah biohazard <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">At first I was a little hesitant about the size, but it seems to play well even with just a few people. Unfortunately, I don't have many playing minutes in it so I'm not sure about being able to get the rpg that easily. However, what little I did play won me over hands down. I really like this map so far! Quality Valar work! Good use of the Ravenholm textures. They seldom feel out of place or repetitive. All parts of the map have their own unique feel. Maybe except for knowing which side is which in the central room. There are a few things there so you can orient yourself there, but I wouldn't mind something like a decal on one of the walls.<br>
<br>
I saw two places where it looked like textures high up on buildings were lacking. No biggie though. I can show you if you don't know where.<br>
<br>
My biggest issue is maybe with the spawn points. I think you would see a lot less spawn raping if you put them in more hidden places. Even if you say that you'll be running with spawn protection anyway, I say that with hiding spawn points you will see fewer newly spawned players standing around waiting for passers by to turn their backs... This would also make the map more playable in tdm without further modifications.<br>
<br>
Besides that, I would prefer if you kept to the HL2DMU naming scheme as in dm_bloom. What's the story behind that name anyway?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">hi there valar, nice looking map you made. have played a couple of times on the map now and i have a few little comments about it.<br>
<br>
if a player dont like the prop_fhysics ,he can throw them out of the game by throwing them over certain parts off the house buildings on the side off youre map. i tried it and i dont believe they are comming back in game.(no teleport trigger above the building side i think). mayby putting a clip above the buildings?? .<br>
<br>
and the central room looks/feels a little bit strange. i get the feeling in that room that it had no funtion in relation to the building or reality. diffecult to explain but the room looks unreal to me.<br>
<br>
 i played there with a few players and i noticed that most players dont go below the buildings. because its a big map those hallways under the ground are mayby to much space.<br>
and i think a little less wood texture there would brake it up more(also the central room has alot off wood texture).<br>
<br>
and as said by cynips more spawnpoints to prevent spawnkilling,it happend to me a few times allready with a few players ingame.<br>
<br>
but overal a damm nice map, good work valar.<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">thanks for your inputs.<br>
<br>
this map has been playing now for a few days. <br>
both the basement and the main big room hold most of the game most of the time and seem far from redundant. altho the main room can sure use some orientation decals. very true.<br>
<br>
a few ppl who complained the supercharger is too fast. will be change to a normal one in next rev. <br>
ill sort the props clips. very true that and thanks.<br>
<br>
ive heard a few ppl saying the map is "way too big". which is really strange as bloom is not big in any sense. its not even half the size of LD and swamplight and is smaller than LV.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral">  btw, none of them actually played the map.<br>
<br>
about the sawblades and the two big blades...dunno...so many ppl are loving them and yet ive got 2-3 ppl (bhoppers) who really dont. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> so its a bit puzzling.<br>
<br>
also, para...i've repeatedly asked ppl if anyone was getting any FPS lag and found none.  goes for 3-4 years old systems !!!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The temperature monitor says its not an overheating issue but it has been a while since I cleaned the dust out of the box.  Im going to try that and if that doesn't work them im gona pull one of the cards out and see how that goes.  Funny thing is that its not happening all the time.  Its possible I got a card that's failing.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, I didn't actually say more spawn points, but better placed. It's true that more spawn points would also help with spawn killing, since you'd have less chance of being by any that you can see. On the other hand, it will <strong class="text-strong">not</strong> solve the problem with spawn protection. If a spawn point is openly positioned, it will take some effort to get out of sight of someone that has spawned there and just is waiting for you to turn your back.<br>
<br>
So, lots of well positioned spawn points <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
Other than that, I think there's been some really good feedback coming up here. I agree with most of it.<br>
<br>
As far as gameplay taking place mostly indoors, I can't tell. If that is the case I'm thinking it is due to the orbs, smg nades and props you can find there (as well as the charger).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

agreed with that. we played there and some players have said that. when you are in battle and you think you can pick up a sawblade/proppelor and it turns out to be static ,you lose. most players getting confused off that.  <br>

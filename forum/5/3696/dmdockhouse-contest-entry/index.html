	<div class="content">Here was my entry to the mapping contest: dm_dockhouse<br>
<br>
I tried to keep it into some of the themes that you would typically see in the HL2 world. The main issue the judges had with it was small size and lack of areas to fight in.<br>
<br>
Here's a few screenshots, the rest can be seen and the map can be downloaded at:<br>

Absolutely gorgeous and impeccable detailing. <br>
If you're planning on ever mapping for L4D (when SDK is released) you could turn this into one of the areas in the campaign. super scary.<br>
in any case, it's a perfect 1v1 for hl2dm. <br>
<br>
10 out of 10.<br>

	<div class="content">You've got a good handle on hl2 mapwork. The execution is excellent, could be a chunk of SP hl2. GREAT detailing, little touches like the fishnet and the blocklight boat shadow really stand out. Add in the poor framerates though and I'd say you've got more work to do.<br>
 <br>
Big laggy water is usually a nono, but that's not the major cause of bad frames here. Going spec, the void outside the map is sky blue which I've seen on other badly performing maps. Dunno why that is. I checked with wireframe 3 and you have TONS of optimizing to do here, I'd say you could squeeze quite a bit more out of this. As it is you have no prop or item fades, no hinting or areaportaling. I can see everything from everywhere which is gonna be tough to fix given the layout. You might have to resort to occlusion in some spots as well.<br>
<br>
I'm glad that this competition has attracted talented creators like yourself for this game, this rocks for the 'immersion' factor imo ( good sound work too btw ). Keep it up!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">if i'm not mistaking; the void is in fact the fog and if anything, can only reduce lag and up frames = performance. also, there isn't anywhere to areaportal here unless it's an opened one which i would bet won't do nothing.<br>
hinting - no doubt. speaking of which - read the bible <a href="http://rvanhoorn.ruhosting.nl/optimization.php" class="postlink"><strong class="text-strong">HERE</strong></a>. <br>
maybe also try turning more brushes to detail and defo as hey says - fade distance all your props, weapons and ammos.<br>
btw, just a thought, but i would try actually relocating ALL the water over to the skybox and restrict player access beyond the edge of the dock.<br>
<br>
and again - one of the best maps made use of stock hl2 materials and what's more important - Storytelling.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

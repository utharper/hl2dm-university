	<div class="content">This is the first map I've released and I've been working on it for a good few months now, after months of procrastination since beta 5, I've finally dusted off the final version(which I never actually envisioned happening). It's a medium/large map with a somewhat symmetrical layout.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You can grab it here:</strong> <a href="http://www.filefront.com/14189859/dm_kowloon.rar" class="postlink">http://www.filefront.com/14189859/dm_kowloon.rar</a>     &lt;---- <strong class="text-strong">new bsp</strong> updated with proper cubemap files.<br>
<br>
The previous beta versions had been posted around on some other community sites but I saved the final version for here  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
<br>
The name doesn't actually have anything to do with Kowloon, or the walled city of kowloon, the map started out as a map on the rooftops of that city but it eventually changed to what it is now, though the name stayed the same.<br>
<br>
I don't really have any clue as to how to organise some sort of a play test session so if somebody could pretty please push me in the right direction i would be very grateful.<br>
<br>
If some of you guys could download it and check it out I would be above grateful, thank you and enjoy!<br>

	<div class="content">I'm impressed, Really very nice job man. Okay first thing, you should clip the stairs so you get a ramp out of player clips. That makes movement easier. I guess you should come up with an idea to make it ahrder to get the RPG also. I don't have much time really. I will look at it more closly later. Just a few tips here. More will come.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The only things I see bad in that pic are the mattresses. They are really worthless in a dm environment. Other then that, I think the room is big enough to hold that many props. From the screens, it looks like a very nice map. How it plays, only time will tell.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Thanks for all the positive feedback so far. I don't mean to sound too ahead of myself or what not, but if the map is put into circulation on a server I'd really appreciate it if you could quickly PM me the ip address so I can play a few games there myself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 If I can't rename it, then I guess the only option is to not run the final version of this map on the servers, as there are many players our there who downloaded the first version of this map with the name "dm_kowloon" before the second version of the same name came out.  I'll see if this final version is still causing issues, and if so, I guess I will have to roll back to the pre-final releases. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You could just go  back and look for the most recent working version and try again.  ...and include _r1 or something after the map name so we know which version is which. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I just had a little run around on your server and to get the cubemaps working properly you can do it all yourself. If you don't want to use the dm_kowloon.bsp I uploaded you can just copy paste it and rename it to dm_kowloon_r1.bsp and then build the cubemaps yourself.<br>
<br>
That way everyone can play by just downloading that bsp from your server - and more importantly I won't have to upload another bsp to a bunch of sites  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
<br>
If you don't know how to create cubemaps you just open up a match with yourself via the "create server" option and then just type buildcubemaps into the console. The cubemap files will then be embedded into the bsp and you need just to restart the game for them to appear as planned.<br>
<br>
Anyway I hope I made sense and thanks a lot for hosting my map, I'm sure you know it means a lot. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

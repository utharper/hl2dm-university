	<div class="content">Hello ! =D<br>
<br>
With Cartel, we started to take dm_resident as homemap, we found this great !<br>
We are in div. 2 on CU and we wanted to take this as homemap instead of dm_lostvillage.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, CU admins didn't let us having dm_resident so the afternoon they said "No !!", I started Hammer (that I didn't started for ages) and started to edit dm_resident. I made lots of versions (nearly 15) always asking to my team mates what to do anymore while testing new version. After lots of version, I said "Yes ! This is our new homemap !" so I posted it on CU forum but I forgot a quite big leak that eGz' Warez fixed. Now the final version is here, DM RESIDENT R1.<br>
<br>
Now, after three months and half playing it. I bring my mod_map to you ! =D<br>
<br>
What's news since the original dm_resident?<br>
<br>
-Useless physics removed<br>
-A secret room<br>
-New weapon placement<br>
-New health placement<br>
-New respawns and 2 respawns deleted<br>
-Some new ledges<br>
-Ledge above de magnum room deleted<br>
-Door and windows are bigger<br>
-Chimney is bigger, you can now jump into this one and make some new tactics<br>
-New camping point for new tactics<br>
-More powerful light 'cause of a light problem in the d or e version (Fixed to realistic light)<br>
-Game flow is now good and you can jump through the map fastly<br>
-Nodraw texture to have a better file size (original : 4069Ko; pro with out nodraw : 5500Ko; final version : 4349Ko) and better FPS<br>
-Etc..<br>
<br>
This map is more competive and you can make more and more tactics on. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sure you want some screens! =D<br>

yes it is.<br>
solution - use the map protector (<a href="http://eyeclan.net/eyeden/hl2mp/maps/protector.zip" class="postlink">http://eyeclan.net/eyeden/hl2mp/maps/protector.zip</a>) plus there is a second protection method.

Hello Reaper47,<br>
<br>
Sorry, I didn't contacte you before.. I was in a fast spirit mod to edit this great map to a competitive one for CU andI  finished it just before my Girlfriend came for 1 week and just before the end of homemap choice on CLans United. ^^<br>
<br>
Plus this map is old (2005) and when I sought who did this map, I didn't find anything. =s I hope I didn't make you angry and you'll enjoy this map modification. =)<br>
<br>
Cynips, I'm agree with you but perhaps it makes the game faster. =]</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No harm done, darkhead_. I had a run through your edit, and most of the changes seem very logical to me.<br>

Please don't publish the map only under your own name, though, and give credit when uploading it. This would be the mother-link for info:<br>

	<div class="content">Granted, I'm sure it contributes to somewhat to balance out the otherwise dominating rpg. But why did you decide to move the two orbs away from the upper room?

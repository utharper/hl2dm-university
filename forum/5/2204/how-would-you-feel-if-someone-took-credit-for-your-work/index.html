I know it would piss me off. I try to give credit where credit is due. For example, I'm working on a map that has some prefabs from fpsbanana. I did nothing but download/copy/paste. I feel that I need to give credit where credit is due, so I'm adding game_texts so the player knows that Beef did not spend 4 hours making a prefab replica of York Tower -- Greyfrog Designs did.  And so on....<br>
<br>
Now, check this out.<br>

Seriously, WTF.<br>
And we all know and love (or hate) Singe's maps.<br>
<a href="http://singe.telefragged.com/hl2/maps/" class="postlink">http://singe.telefragged.com/hl2/maps/</a><br>
<br>
I emailed Singe, so he knows. But I'm curious about what the community thinks about this? Fellow mappers, let your voice be heard!<br>
Oh, and you non-mappers can probably say something too. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
I know this is not the first time, or last time something like this will happen. But it's annoying and stupid. Why take credit for something you haven't done?  <br>

Maybe they're doing some cleanup. I'm not the only one who noticed they were ripping off. There were numerous messages left for them on their forum about the maps.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
I visited Singe's website again, and he did update his site so it clarifies that he is not associated with that "clan," or whatever they are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I occasionally remake older maps and have been reprimanded (and justifiably so) for slapping our team logo on the walls.  Problem is that I can't do anything about that now since the maps are already out there.  It might be a good idea to have a map maker directory in the Uni where you can find the author behind any particular map.  Naturally this has to be a central page, not forum posts.<br>

<ul><li><strong class="text-strong">EXAMPLE</strong><br>
MAP: MAPNAME<br>
AUTHOR: MAPPER 1<br>
REMAKES: MAPPER 2, MAPPER 3, MAPPER 4 etc.</li></ul>

Take dm_magnum, a map that I've made 2 versions of.<br>

<ul><li>MAP: dm_magnum<br>
AUTHOR: gDawgg Moose<br>
REMAKES: [ELEA] Smacker Vino (dm_eleastyle_magnum, dm_wiremagnum)</li></ul>

I embedded this information in the map text so it shows on the screen in-game; still, there are other maps I've remade that I have no CLUE who made and would really like to find out so I can give credit where credit's due.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

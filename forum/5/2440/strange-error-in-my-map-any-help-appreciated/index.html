	<div class="content">OK, so I have nearly got my first proper map to its beta stage (so close now^), but I'm having a really strange error with the map when testing it......all my entities and func's work perfectly well for a few minutes, then, for some reason the func_doors in my map stop working, and players are unable to pick up any of the weapons and health in the map, they just behave like objects. <br>
<br>
When running my map on a self created server i usually get a crash shortly after this happens, with the error "ED_Alloc: No free edicts", though I have read in other help forums that this means there are too many entities....but in the compiling text it says i have used far less than the maximum number of entities allowed. (also when running the map on a normal server there are no crashing issues , server or user side)<br>
<br>
I have done the usual forum scanning to find any similar probs but so far I cant find anything, i just wondered if any of the experienced mappers here may have encountered anythin similar, or have a inkling as to what is causing this....<br>
<br>
as always, any help is much appreciated, and if anyone wanting to help feels they would need a look at the map themselves, that is better at directly analysing map errors via console or w/e then I'll happily provide it.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

	<div class="content">I am not a mapper, so I am not really qualified to comment, but I did have someone tell me something about maximum entities once, something about it being fine when editing the map, but when you run the map you can go over at some point during the round because the items that are repawning add to the count...or something like that?<br>
<br>
Anyone else know more about how this works?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Here's the link to the .vmf<br>

<br>
and here's a link to my custom textures so the whole map isnt just a mass of pink and black squares ^(as pretty much every texture is custom)<br>

if there's nething else you need then just ask. also, appologies if my mapping is sloppy by your standards!<br>

Material not found!: /BRO_21-ICON - missing a custom texture<br>
ProcessBlock_Thread: 0...1...2...3...4...5...Brush 295748: WARNING, microbrush<br>
Brush 295714: WARNING, microbrush<br>
then it proceeds to show you all your "CONTENTS_SOLID" brushes. this means you have a leak. a major one and definitly a brush mess.<br>
further down the log you see models sticking outside the map borders.<br>
and then you have 13529 numportals. you can't have that in a map. this is way too much than what you should have. for reference - 3000 numportals is too much.<br>
then this:  "WARNING: Cluster portals saw into cluster" this means you got illegal brushes or brushes colliding with other brushes. bad.<br>
<br>
pretty much every aspect of your map has errors in it. <br>
<br>
It always comes to mind when i see new mappers making huge, overkill detailed maps - wouldn't it make more sense to start smaller? and learn while working ?<br>
<br>
ill look at the vmf.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

And ofc everything starts small, i didnt set out to make an overly complicated map, but I got my basic theme idea and ran with it, thought, 'it'd be nice if my map had this' , found a tut, made it, added it, etcetc and it soon became quite complicated, BUT I think my map has potential with this theme etc so I'll attempt to fix the problems rather than start from scratch, atleast to begin with <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> ^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

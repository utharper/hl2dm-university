	<div class="content">So I've been toying with the thought of making really detailed maps for hide and go seek fun!<br>
Unfortunately, Im a craptastic mapper and dont really have the time to make such a map.<br>
The idea started after me and LukeGT and a few others were messing around in maps like dm_island17, dm_powerhouse, dm_steamlab, dm_runoff and a few other huge maps with alot of non-player clipped areas that make it fun for playing hide and go seek. <br>
For the most part, you wouldnt have to actually make a map for hide and go seek as there are so many huge maps with poor player clipping in them that are good enough.<br>
<br>
However I'd love to see someone just make a map for just the occasion. Tons of non player clipped areas and alot of detailed architecture for hiding on, behind, and around.<br>
<br>
Anyone up for it? I mean...surely it wouldnt be too hard....just pointless. lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Some of the S-UK maps are perfect for hide and seek. <br>
<br>
I think you'd like Castle for all it's secret hiding places, it's pretty big as well. Babylon is rather nice as well. All would be decent for hide and seek.<br>

	<div class="content">I've stated this several times on here, I wanted a newer version for myself. Other's asked for it, and the map got around. A new version wasn't needed, I wanted a better looking version, that's all. The changes, such as the doors being gone were suggestion's. I didn't want to change the map at all myself, aside from giving it a new look.<br>
<br>
If people like it, all the better, if not, I don't care.<br>
<br>
This is the problem with remake's , and exactly why I have abandoned quite a few map's. People will alway's bitch, or complain that it's not exactly the same. Even when it is, ppl gripe that it's larger, ect. My remake of lockdown, dm_lostvillage 3, and dm_revolt are all done, but because of the mindset in this tiny community, they probably never will be released.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">oh ok.  I didn't really study the map.  I thought since you stated above that a healthpack was added on the catwalk that maybe other things were changed on the map too, like in the previous version v2.<br>

Nice job on the remake.  I like the look. The fps around a lot of areas like the tank area are better in your version.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I tried to change as little as possible, as far as entities go, and brushwork. Some things couldn't be helped. For what I set out to do, I'm happy with it, and ty <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

@ biotaw, only suggestion i have is add a screen OnMapSpawn reading "ARE YOU SITING DOWN?"<br>
@ everyone else. even if not for its looks this version has WAY better FPS than any rendition i've seen to this map. BigUps. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

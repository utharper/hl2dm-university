	<div class="content">Howdy, dm_stad is my map that i made for the mapping contest. its main focus is around fun gameplay with "jump-ramps" at the courners that send people flying like in quake 3 arena for example. feel free to tell me what you think about the map if you try it out.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.map-factory.org/half-life-2/deathmatch/dm-stad-1320" class="postlink">http://www.map-factory.org/half-life-2/ ... -stad-1320</a><br>
<br>
So, the idea of dm_stad ("stad" means town/city in swedish) is that some sort of company drives around in their big trucks from town to town, killing the locals, and setting up deathmatches for people to watch and bet money on. <br>
They have put up fences to keep the combatants inside the "arena", and in this case they have put these "jump-ramps" at all 4 cournes of the arena to crank things up a notch, BAM!<br>
The combatants are the locals, that weren't too old or too young to fight (notice the tags on each house front door), accompanied by the winner from the previous town this company visited. I call it "Deathmatch on Tour". The trucks can be seen outside the map where there's also some grandstand for the spectators.<br>

idea, very elegant. LOL Deatmatch on Tour, one of the many nice little touches that show<br>
attention to detail in making this, like the hopscotch decal. This is one of the most<br>
realized maps I've seen for bringing a theme to. For some reason I keep thinking Sunnyvale<br>
Trailer Park.<br>
<br>
Minuses: The layout works but seems a tad repetitive; borderline performance in more than a<br>
couple of areas; stairwell is much too dark ( I know it fits the theme but no good for<br>
gameplay ); white texture bug on the bbq and concrete block model; can't shoot through the<br>
hedges; some details should be non-solid for player movement.<br>

Oskmos, phong-shaders are not supported under ep1 engine (thx to boshed for the insight and link <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> )<br>
best edit those lines out (add a  //  in front of the command) in the VMTs they're in and release along with any other fixes (if you're intending on doing any bug fixing that is).<br>
i'm DL'ing now. but looking at the screens this is WOW. very L4D. very interesting. and as haymaker pointed out - you're an interesting mapper we would sure like to see more coming from you in the future. Great job.<br>
now lemme go DL and hurry back to trash you're work. just a sec.<br>

And about the Phong-shaders, it works on my computer, and my laptop, and every other computer i've run this map on. they added phong shaders for episode 1, and then after that they updated all games previous of ep1 with the same features, (HDR and phong-shader etc...) And that bug with the props turning white is really wierd, its only when the props are standing still that they are white.<br>
if more people report this error, i guess i have to edit the .VMT but i've already uploaded the map <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>

About the lighting in the staircase, im gonna leave it pitch-black, to much work for such a small thing, and i dont really see the problem, i kind of like the gameplay that occurs in there. kaotik and intense <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> and a nice contrast to the, sometimes, long distance combat found outside the house.

I've put the weapons fairly close to the jump-ramps (located at the courners next to the smg1-grenades) and the crossbows on top of the center-house to make people use the ramps. So placing more weapons down by the houses would make it less important to use the ramps, so im satisfied with weapon placement.<br>
<br>
Here's a map i made that shows where all pick-ups are located except for some slams thats inside the center-house (the map shows the old version without the pine trees. And i think the placement of frags is still the same)<br>

<br>
well if someone wants to put this up for a public-server with many players, you can allways use 'weaponstay'. I'm satisified with wepaonplacement. I want to make people use the ramps as much as i can without making it obvious. So splitting up the crossbows would work against that goal. But hey, the .357 is far away, and that can be used as a sniper of sorts <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>

For a pub map it doesnt have enough weapons also having 2 crossbows right next to each other is a bit odd.   Ask Valar how many times he has had to adjust weapons in a map.  LOL!  Adding a couple of weapons and healthpacks etc would be a pretty easy fix.  Its disappointing that you are unwilling to change it  because it would be alot of fun to play.  As it is, I probably wont run it because there just wont be enough weapons in a pub atmosphere and that will kill the fun on the map if people cant get a weapon.  Oh well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think there's enough weapons, the map may look big, but its not, so you'r never far away from weapons. And with the ramps you can basically get any weapon you want with-in 10 seconds from spawn. We have played this with like 8 poeple in it and the lack of weapons was never a problem. If you still think there's a lack of weapons for public servers, just use weaponstay. The map is finnished, i wont go back to change anything, im as satisfied as one can be. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Paradox wrote:</cite>having 2 crossbows right next to each other is a bit odd</div></blockquote>It increases the chance for a crossbow to be avalible for pick-up for those who get up there.

You may be wanting that, but in practice a lot of the time jumps/pushes result in the player being an easier target while in the air for a good mag user. Plus there's fall damage as an annoyance. There's plenty of maps out there that fall prey to this ( I made one of them ). As a player I would probably avoid using them as a destination constantly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I liked the theme.  To much repetition though,  and you can get lost and never find any weapons from spawn points.  Biggest drawback that I found was the RPG is easy to get and then you can get on a jump pad that leads to another jump pad.    Not to mention that the pads have all kinds of pick-ups nearby.  So for a pub, that is all you would need.  Grab rpg, jump in air, Rain down the Rpg and smg_nades.  If all of the pick-ups were moved away from the pads it would be a lot better.  making the rpg in a house with a hole in the roof and the only way to get it would be to jump in the middle.  So you have no fast track to the pads would go a long way also.<br>
<br>
These pads are fast enough and at an angle were you aren't gonna mag them down easily.  Speaking of mags, they would be a lot of fun on this map, but good luck finding one.<br>

	<div class="content">Hey Oskmos,<br>
<br>
You seem to be quite an intelligent person so i'm going to go ahead and tell you what i think without sugar-coating it too much <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
if you're mapping for yourself that's fine and you're right not to take any inputs or even care what people might think of your work. BUT, if you're mapping for people to play your map my advise to you is this - put your ego aside and LISTEN to what people tell you. You don't have to swallow every but you have to take it into consideration, try to understand if there's a reasonable input here of just BS from someone who doesn't know anything about anything. filter but don't block.<br>
<br>
I know many will disagree with the following but this is what i think. personal opinion:<br>
<br>
My mapping philosophy for what its worth is that the people (who are actually going to play my map) and i are ONE UNIT. <br>
And as a ONE UNIT, the people and the mapper work TOGETHER on making the map a success. in other words; you NEED people to HELP YOU make a GOOD MAP. Open up to input; not only this is the correct way of creating for public but also because there is no way around it.<br>
<br>
I know how it feels to not win and you think How could they NOT see how amazing my map is (and i'm being serious) but this is exactly the path we take as creators; not always do people feel the way WE DO about our own creations.<br>
<br>
I truly hope we'll see more stuff coming from you. You've great talent - hope your ego can help it and not hinder it.<br>

	<div class="content">I think that the reason for my maps beeing so different is because im doing it wrong <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
I consider my self an environment-artist and not a level-designer. So when im gonna start building a map, im thinking about how the map will look, and what setting it will take place in. Not about layout, ie for dm_stad, i wanted to build a map of a small swedish "stad" (city). this way of doing things often makes my maps really different, and most of the time it works really well.<br>
Not once have i made any large change to my brushwork after the map has been playtested. But im not totally oblivious to what would play well and what wouldn't. But im just telling you, i basically build maps to make them pretty.<br>
<br>
So i guess thats why my maps are so different. When it comes to dm_stad, i didn't want to listen to the feedback and make a map like all the other maps out there. I'ts like there's a right and a wrong when it comes to how a map should be like, and how the different weapons should be placed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I liked the city aspect of it.  I dont have much of a clue on how to make maps. I have however played alot of maps and I do have an idea what makes a map a good/great map and what makes a map fun.  I really dont believe it would take much to make it into a great map.<br>
<br>
As far as not winning, well there were 22 maps and it was a really really really hard choice.  There is alot of great material here and to be honest it is more important to me that we get some great, fun new maps to play on for both pubs and for competition and honestly IMO the pubs are more important because we all start out as pub players whether we are willling to admit that or not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

there we go! I have not tested the weapon layout with more than 4 people so I dont know how it will play. If anyone of you do play it on a crowded server, please let me know how it plays.<br>
<br>
So the changes are:<br>
<br>
-RPG is in the basement of the center house<br>
-Staircase has been lit up and widened so that you can jump from the top floor all the way down to the RPG<br>
-smg1_grenades has been removed from the ramps, 2 has been placed where the RPG used to be and 1 on top of the 2-story building in the center<br>
-More weapons!<br>
-And some new deciduous trees</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

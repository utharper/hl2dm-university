Its a lot brighter than my usual maps, which is bugging <br>
me.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>

-I'd like not to have "invisible walls" ... maybe make that part player clipped but remove the walls...<br>
-I'd like the teleport to teleport grenades too (telefraggin!)<br>

<br>
that's all I recall lol<br>
now, I reaaaally liked the map, I think it has great potential, there are few "futuristic" with height differences maps out there, so it is great to have another one.<br>
Freaking cool and creative stuff like those round doors or whatever I may call them, the electric ladder, the on/off switch when shotting, etc.<br>
<br>
Remember this is just my personal opinion, you can take it or leave it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">, I just think that with the right changes, this could be a great addition to hl2dm maps.

Where are the invisinble walls?

will do

sounds good, ill try setting the lift in the center to jump speed

hmm, there is 1 physics, the shiny orb held in place in the center of the map, press the left button to release it. <br>
it also acts as a health and suit charger when you carry it.<br>

	<div class="content">haha you quoted my stuff as fearsome's &gt;.&lt;<br>
invisible walls are the "border" walls of the map. the part where you see the 3rd skybox but can't get ouside, problem with that is that it interferes with gameplay (you can explode stuff on the walls, bounce props, use it for grenade tosses). Not that it was bad to do that, but that would be ok if there were actually walls in there, if the map "seems" to continue, I don't like smg nades exploding without any aparent reason in the air, or grenades bouncing ;o<br>
<br>
oh remembered something else.... not a huge fan of the light blue link that pops up on my screen from time to time, it distracts, but that's up to you ;o<br>
if you do consider removing it, maybe try something like a trigger to get those messages, kinda like in aim_arena_reloaded. You make sure to have like an "easter egg" on your map as the credits, while not bothering players. :]</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think that has an easy fix, you should not use the "CLIP" tooltexture but the "Player Clip", if not, it's bouncin' against the 3D skybox, that would mean to put the skybox far away and put a player clip in the borders of the map, the nades and stuff will fly away but the players will be kept inside.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

im concious of adding to much more detail, as you say fps will suffer. but i know what you mean <br>
theres a few areas i left blocky becuase of that concern.<br>
When you say bridge do you mean the circular glass bridge?<br>

it was clipping becuase that is the skybox boarder, i used a 3d skybox to creat the illusion of space, but im gonna try extending the real skybox further back (hopefully fps wont suffer for it)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you see closer in some VALVe developed maps for half life 2, and deathmatch, they have lots of "Trigger" brushes and such, I believe these are for loading the rest of the map when the player goes trough a door, hallway, etc, so the FPS don't suffer, a good example is the first trainstation in Half Life 2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
If you see closer in some VALVe developed maps for half life 2, and deathmatch, they have lots of "Trigger" brushes and such, I believe these are for loading the rest of the map when the player goes trough a door, hallway, etc, so the FPS don't suffer, a good example is the first trainstation in Half Life 2.</div></blockquote>

kind of but not quite. the running in Single Player can andure lower FPS rates because processing and memory wise it has a lot less to do. the story is quite different in Multi Player. the whole FPS equation is a whole different story and affected by other element than just the graphics demands of the map.<br>
For the same reason... the whole idea of areaportals and occluders which you'll find in abundance in Single Player maps doesn't work the same for Multiplayer. entities which blocks visability (of models, entities as well as whole areas) are being processed in realtime. meaning they burden the CPU and RAM all the time! even when they're not used!<br>
<br>
Triggering parts of the map in Single Player is actually loading a new map altogether. for the player that's merely a continuance of the chapter he's in but not for the game. this of course, cannot be done in Multiplayer.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, there is no avoiding planning out your maps with Optimization first and foremost in mind.<br>

	<div class="content">tried it, liked the changes, just some questions and stuff.<br>
<br>
-There is kinda a way to change the teleport destination or something like that, I just know I kept shooting those "yellow squares" and the teleport showed different images, and the blue health thingy drops o.0 Would you mind explaining that to me?<br>
<br>
-The jumps pads are cool and make the game faster now, but I would try adding one on the back part (since you have 2 on the front close to each other).<br>
<br>
-How do you get to the upper part? O.O only way I could was using the jump pad and nading myself ;o<br>
<br>
-There is (as far as I tried) one of the corners where you can stand over it, dunno if it was intentional or you just didn't notice...<br>
<br>
-Barrels are nice, maybe add one to the jump pads part? imagine a mid air frag with that <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
I would try using a sawblade (not much, people whine about them) since it's one of the few props I think fit the style of the map.<br>
<br>
-Maybe you could use some custom textures or props?<br>
<br>
-oh and .... dunno how the blue health thing will be in a match ... it is endless right? maybe you should limit it, otherwise people will overuse it...<br>
<br>
-respawn is 100/30? D: any special reason?<br>
<br>
-I'd like to try the map without fall damage... see how it changes...<br>

the yellow squares release or constrict the orb + there is a camera attachec to it.  chuck it in the air and watch the screen... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
*the image on the upper is kinda a bug, it should display the same image as the monitor in the courtyard but instead only changes 1 image at a time after you look at the main 1 and go back to it.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>0nti wrote:</cite>-The jumps pads are cool and make the game faster now, but I would try adding one on the back part (since you have 2 on the front close to each other).</div></blockquote>
i did consider that but i wanted to keep some movement restricted to encourage encounters. i may try it in the next beta version.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>0nti wrote:</cite>-How do you get to the upper part? O.O only way I could was using the jump pad and nading myself ;o</div></blockquote>
i phys jump using 1 of the small radiators or smg nade it as you did. there is 1 spawn point up there  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

sounds good<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>0nti wrote:</cite>I would try using a sawblade (not much, people whine about them) since it's one of the few props I think fit the style of the map.</div></blockquote>
your the 2nd to ask, i may add 1<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>0nti wrote:</cite>-Maybe you could use some custom textures or props?</div></blockquote>

hmm<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>0nti wrote:</cite>-oh and .... dunno how the blue health thing will be in a match ... it is endless right? maybe you should limit it, otherwise people will overuse it...</div></blockquote>
i am keen to see how that works in a match. One of the buttons releases the orb and the other will snatch it away from whoever has it, so hoarding wont really work? <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>0nti wrote:</cite>-respawn is 100/30? D: any special reason?</div></blockquote>
hmm, no<br>

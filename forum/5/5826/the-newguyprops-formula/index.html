	<div class="content">All simple shit, and it fucking works:<br>
<strong class="text-strong">NewGuyProps</strong>:<br>
let pT = Prop Total <br>
let p1 = Indestructible Props (gay shit) <br>
let p2 = Non-Volatile Destructible Props (boxes) <br>
let p3 = Volatile/Explosive Destructible Props (barrels) <br>
let sT = Shotgun entity Total<br>
pT = p1 + p2 + p3  <br>
p1 = Range : {(sT) : [(1.25*(sT))+1.3]}<br>
p2 = Range : {[((0.8)*p1)-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*p1)+(1.3])}<br>
p3 = Range : {[((0.8)*p1)-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*p1)+(1.3)]} <br>
(**p2&amp;p3 range's are to w/e the whole integer value is; i.e: 5.9 = 5 and 0.9 = 0; no rounding needed) <br>
It is recommended that you use volatile props around control/vital areas (SC, RPG, ar2) and use non-volatile destructible props in areas of spam gathering to slightly ostracize the smg_nades and orbs. <br>
This way a map has that gravity_gun driven feel to it and does NOT have a lot of BS props in the way fucking up combat and such. <br>
You try to spread the props you have within this formula, not just spam them everywhere like in Lockdown. <br>
<br>
The map is then balanced between engaging-props and clutter. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Current Map examples</strong>: <br>
dm_airfusion_final<br>
pT = p1 + p2 + p3  <br>
p1 = Range : {(4) : [(1.25*(4))+1.3]} = {4:6} ; currently 4.<br>
p2 = Range : {[((0.8)*(4))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(4))+(1.3)]} = {2:6} ; currently 5<br>
p3 = Range : {[((0.8)*(4))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(4))+(1.3)]} = {2:6} ; currently 5<br>
pT = 14 <br>
<br>
dm_minelab_rc3:<br>
pT = p1 + p2 + p3  <br>
p1 = Range : {(4) : [(1.25*(4))+1.3]} = {4:6} ; currently 5.<br>
p2 = Range : {[((0.8)*(5))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(5))+(1.3)]} = {3:7} ; currently 6<br>
p3 = Range : {[((0.8)*(5))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(5))+(1.3)]} = {3:7} ; currently 6<br>
pT = 17  <br>
<br>
EDIT: dm_asylum_final (...please, Valar?): <br>
pT = p1 + p2 + p3  <br>
p1 = Range : {(5) : [(1.25*(5))+1.3]} = {5:7} ; currently 7.<br>
p2 = Range : {[((0.8)*(7))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(7))+(1.3)]} = {5:9} ; currently 9<br>
p3 = Range : {[((0.8)*(7))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(7))+(1.3)]} = {5:9} ; currently 8<br>
pT = 24 (suggestion) <br>
<br>
EDIT: dm_rapidfire_final <br>
pT = p1 + p2 + p3  <br>
p1 = Range : {(5) : [(1.25*(5))+1.3]} = {5:7} ; currently 6.<br>
p2 = Range : {[((0.8)*(6))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(6))+(1.3)]} = {4:8} ; currently 7<br>
p3 = Range : {[((0.8)*(6))-(0.5)] : [((1.2)*(6))+(1.3)]} = {4:8} ; currently 8<br>
pT = 21  <br>

The ranges are for the mappers themselves to decide, and even such a small change can effect the flow and feel of a map to a very high degree. <br>
The spamming of props was Valve way of forcing people to see how gay their new physics system was, and we saw. <br>
<br>
This formula helps for a standardization for gameplay that the majority of competitive hl2dm players come to expect from the environments they play in. <br>
And yah, both caverns and lostarena are outside of these ranges and I guarantee they would BOTH be more playable if they were within the newguy formula. <br>
No map should have 0 indestructible props just as it should NOT have too many. <br>
Having such a wide variance between different environments of the same game is just fetal, benign, and unprofessional.  <br>
<br>
This formula takes the wide-open and complex creative task of what to do about props in a mappers environment and breaks it down to some kind of sense of order and reason.

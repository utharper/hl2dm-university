	<div class="content">Hey all,<br>
This is my first map so I hope you like it. Map has 10 stages and 2 bonuses (when you finish can take special color GGun) and 1 extra bonus (with special GGun too) and one door at ENDZone for restart.<br>
EndZone and last stages (Surf stage with water part) not finished and bonuses not finished too. Other stages are finished and now working on detailed same with StarZone.<br>
<br>
I am Looking for:<br>
<strong class="text-strong">-BetaTester's so who is interested to write into the topic.<br>
-Server where can test map.</strong><br>
(Of course all BetaTester's and ServerIP give into credit's.)<br>
<br>
Thank You<br>

I think the map is hard and also needs instructions in some levels, also there's a deal with uppercase letters in map names on linux servers? idk<br>

	<div class="content">well so far someone said laggy map (i think he had low fps or sumthin tho i didn't encounter this pb) and the rest... agree that it's hard! also, why sv_airaccelerate 1000? this makes it hard to land on small pillars.<br>
ur stage numbering is kinda off, i just counted every doorway:<br>
first level ok, 2nd is for skate? if so, v hard; i find 3rd useless, no dm map has that, even tho i've seen jump maps with that section, one map makes it bypassable; 4th is cool if i weren't annoyed by high airacc causin trouble right on the first landing.. 5 makes no sense; 6 is also useless and used in v few jump maps; 7 is a pita, fun but hard and u could also separate it into 2 air control sections ; 8 is ok, even tho havin the ground beneath you crumble as u strafe jump from it can be annoying and never used in a dm map <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> yet<br>
so.. if ur gonna change acc just for the air control parts and surf, then i suggest do a separate map. normal jumps and maps are with stock settings <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> the ideas are new and fun, tho. textures/mapping bla bla is ok too (from my player opinion.. as a noob mapper, id make a few changes). I also liked the super ggun and the trail <img src="http://i30.tinypic.com/efxxx.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
for more trail ideas pls visit bouncyball coop server lol 94.75.238.251:27015<br>
But change the name capitalization, I think on Linux causes trouble and might even give missing map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Honestly I think you should think your maps to work with default settings. I don't see any point in training in a map if it will not be useful in practical gameplay.<br>
<br>
I think the map is better looking and more coherent than most new jump maps I've seen coming out, but 1000 airaccelerate is plain annoying, imho.<br>
I know that default settings are a bit limited in some ways, but people also are aware of what they can and what they can't do in default settings, since they are used to do this stuff in other maps, and this is where non-default stuff will be a bit out of context.<br>
I'm not saying it's bad, just that it isn't very practical. <br>
<br>
So, once again, the map looks kinda nice, like Ade said, it needs some kind of instructions in most levels, but in overall you're doing quite a nice job and it has quite a few nice ideas.<br>
<br>
The only things I hated in this map are <br>
<br>
- The airaccelerate setting (and if any other not default), makes it very hard to stop at small platfoms, apart from detering from a player's jumping sense.<br>
<br>
- Level 3 bars are cylindrical. I had tried that already in a map I was making and I noticed that if you happen to land on the closest "edge" of the bar you will be proppelled upwards, and it will prevent you from going through the next bars. If you happen to land on the furthest edge you will fail to jump, probably. This makes that section suffer from inconsistency. The way I solved this in my case was to place a square player clip around them.<br>
<br>
- Level 6 speed-crouch stuff has been proven to be a lot inconsistent in Vino's maps. It will work for some players, but will never work for others. First time I tried it I got stuck halfway into the low ceilling. Had to noclip out of it. And I'm one of the people that it doesn't work for.<br>
<br>
- Level 7 is impossible for me with my low sensibility. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> Personaly I will not change sens just to be able play any map. I also think it's a bit frustrating to be sent back to beggining after doing 1st part and failing the 2nd...<br>
<br>
I think that's it. <br>
Anyway, good luck with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: Level 5 doesn't work well, I guess. I was never sent high enough to be able to bhop over the watter walls, if that's it's intention.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If I wasn't waiting for you, and if I didn't know the server was yours, at the time we were there, I'd go off as fast as them. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

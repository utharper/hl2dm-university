	<div class="content">This is beta 1 kids. Not much wrong with it other then the black on the sides of the roads which is caused by building the displacements in the older hammer and not rebuilding them in the orange box hammer lol. Ill probably rebuild them later. Got to much on my plate at hl2ctf to deal with redoing them all right now. Oh and the sawblade cant be picked up....oops. Other then that, its good to go. If you have suggestions feel free to let loose. I went with a theme of the village now being controlled by the rebels.<br>

So basically you said that the map has aesthetic appeal, but the layout was killed. <br>
This was not a map called dm_lostvillage_r5 or someshit, it was fairly obvious that Sac used a similar layout but transcribed the dm_lostvillage as we know into a ctf envriorment. <br>
He spent his own free time porting the map, making very brilliant custom textures, even making realistic displacements in the soil. <br>
<br>
When environments transcend platforms, (such as a q3 map to hl2dm or in this case hl2dm --&gt; hl2ctf) *good* mappers recognize that the size and scale of a map's layout must be mended and amalgamated to appropriately fit the new game it is being played on. <br>
This was one such case. No "killing" occurred.  <br>
<br>
Your "killed it" comment came across as belittlement, for that is why Impala dicked on you for "insulting" someone who is contributing free time and skill to a dead video game. <br>
<br>
You are entitled to your opinion, and you seem to have a hard time conveying it in English. <br>
From what I can tell you still have a negative attitude towards the layout edits. <br>
Impala was telling you to fuck off with the curt layout opinion, since its a creative work that someone put a lot of effort into. <br>
I fucking agree. <br>
<br>
If you don't like a part of the map, be proper and explain your opinion fully to the mapper. <br>
But as you said, you don't care; therefore you won't "admonish" Sac because of the apparent not-caring. <br>
Quite the dick move.<br>
<br>
Impala was not "abusing" you, just letting you know that your behavior was not conducive for a map release/feedback thread. <br>
You were ignorant as to what Sac was trying to do with lostvillage, and now are abundant with arrogance when your asked to elaborate upon your "douchey" analysis.  <br>
<br>
Learn your shit, brah. My dick is small.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yea there are like 3 or 4 different pines in there but there is a lot of repetitiveness. I went quickly through that part lol. There is fog on the map, its behind the trees though. Most of the lighmaps are scaled at 4 on the walls that have light cast on them. When things settle down over at hl2ctf and I get a decent break, I may come back to this one and pretty it up even more. I only worked on this map for about 20 hours or so.

Things that should be fixed/changed:<br>
<br>
1. Remove the ambient sound.<br>
2. Saw Blades should be able to be picked up.<br>
3. Kind of by tank where you added all those boxes where the one box and orb used to be, the smg ammo is half way into the ground due to displacement, it can still be picked up, but it needs to be raised higher.<br>
4. Make the benches in the classroom in rpg house suit charger non moveable or able to be picked up by the ggun, they block doorways and its really annoying.<br>
5. I would really like to see a ledge added back from back mag house to rpg house again, from the top, it's another way to get to rpg so players arnt just looking bottom back or from the front.<br>

I think I need to go over how to determine if a map is good or bad for FPS. It is lower then the worst CAL maps in their worst areas.

Very true.<br>
As for whether it’s easiest to judge FPS when you have a computer that is not on extreme ends of the performance spectrum...here is my take:<br>
I have a very good machine and specs (single GPU, no SLI) as my main game and editor PC. I also run the game on another machine that is 2 years older. When it’s 50 FPS on the old one is about 80 on the new one. The best FPS I get on the old one is around 150 while its verging 300 on the new one. Confused?<br>
One thing I’ve noticed (and if anyone here made the leap from a 2006 rig to a 2008 rig they will back this statement) is FPS can lie. Meaning; sometimes you see 60-50-40 FPS in some areas of a map and it's all (all = vision + your player movement) running smooth regardless, while in other cases you can see 120-130 FPS and the map is literally quaking in front of your eyes.<br>
This means that sometimes the strain on your machine is not the FPS but other elements and aspect in the map you’re in. examples: the debris mound in LD connecting the AR2 room and the hallway. Standing there and facing inward. In the direction of the shotty..you get poor FPS however movement is cool. Lost_village standing in the tank area facing towards the far yard opposing the tank you get poor FPS however movement (though definitely not perfect) is still decent. The lost village example is different for low-end machines. You WILL feel the sluggish behavior around the tank area as oppose to the LD case.<br>
It’s not always the values you’re seeing that sets the playability of a map or an area in a map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I haven't had a chance to run around it, but the visuals scream MGS2 like it's nobodys business.<br>

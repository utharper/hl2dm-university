	<div class="content">I have made this new map, its already been tested alot of times in private play test<br>
and over 80 public games and is now in its final release version.<br>
<br>
I guess I just never got round to posting about it yet!<br>

<br>
- An immensly tactical style of play.<br>
- Players spawn with ar2, mag, shotty and crossbow. Also +15 suit so a crossbow wont kill you in one shot.<br>
- Ammo stash in the middle of the map, suit around the outsides on the ledges which are harder to jump to and orbs placed around too.<br>
<br>
- As the name might suggest it would involve orb spamming, this is not correct.<br>
If someone is trying to spam them alot it is not that hard to frag them while they are doing it.<br>
<br>
- A great shot of someone firing the rpg from the floor to the upper wall.<br>
<img src="http://hl2dkm.co.uk/pseudonym/files/dm_orbzone_screenshots/dm_orbzone_rc70009.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
- General overview of the map from on top of a cube.<br>
<img src="http://hl2dkm.co.uk/pseudonym/files/dm_orbzone_screenshots/dm_orbzone_rc70003.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
- These triangular shapes on the left, which are at all the sides will deflect orbs so you can be accurate and get some good rebounds.<br>
- The metal panel in the floor is a bounce pad for getting on top of the cubes.<br>
- You can use the green alien logo in the corner to get an instant hp boost of 100hp and create a manical laughter sound. handy<br>
<img src="http://hl2dkm.co.uk/pseudonym/files/dm_orbzone_screenshots/dm_orbzone_rc70006.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
- When players cross this central square, a short siren alerts players that its been triggered.<br>
 The force field moves aside slowly and you can access the teleporter to either of the outer edges.<br>
 the force field then closes over again and can be retriggered once its closed.<br>

<br>
I would seriously like this to be considered for use in competitions and leagues.<br>
Try a 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3 on it. It works very well, it also is frantic fun with 8+ players for hectic games.<br>
<br>

I really dont think that a person has to stick to one style of maps and stick to it, i've been trying my hand at a whole range of styles.<br>
<br>
Plus whats more important, brushwork or gameplay flow. Id say gameplay. and those that have played it agree. not to say that this isnt a simple map to make.<br>
<br>
Then lets look dm_killbox_kbh_2 (the most played map on consortium) thats simple. could be made in less than 15 minutes. but thats not the point, is it.<br>
<br>
The point of this map is for fun not to compete for who has the prettiest map.<br>
Like valar said, its not a competition (or a place to degrade each other)<br>
<br>
Its a map which plays fast, tactically and is fun. try it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I am sure you put a lot of work into the map and Ill admit that for a killbox/arena type map it certainly is different than almost anything I have ever seen so kudos to you there.  There are people that love those kind of maps and it may be a lot of fun for them.   <br>
<br>
However the reality is that it wont make a good competition map, at least not for what this group considers to be good for competition (more structured, with good flow).  You might try to find a killbox/arena league/tournament and show it to them.  They might be more willing to try it for competition.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Paradox,  I wasn't 100% on the types of maps that competition organizers were into, I play dm fairly well, but do not do big leagues. Thank you for clearing that up. <br>
 <br>
The Argumentalizer,  You haven't even played the map. How can you say what its flow is like. Surely you have heard the phrase don't judge a book by its cover? :) <br>
 <br>
Yes, as a mapper i can admit that this map is one that doesn't require much skill to build, however it actually does have very good flow and by being able to see your opponent through the cubes means you can be very tactical about your movements and how to counter theirs- this in turn leads to a high frag count and very fast gameplay.<br>
The dimentions of the blocks allow for bhopping inbetween, and on top of them too so you wont abruptly bump into something.<br>
<br>
I have played on this map in over 100 public games now, and have always found it to have fast gameplay and good pacing regardless of the amount of players. Be it 2 or 16.<br>
 <br>
You cant just judge a map on looks, simply because mappers like Valar, Pigpopper etc produce visually stunning maps which have good flow. The design of this one may not be as high res, but if you actually played it with anyone rather than just sitting at your pc putting it down based on some screenshots you would see what ive been trying to get across.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I also read that you spawned with magnum shotty and ar2: this comes to me as more of a 'dm_blades' more than anything else, where if you have good aim you can own the shit out of every1. <br>

You are a complete and utter waste of time and space. and personally if i knew you in real life, i would not want to associate with you.<br>

Hl2dm has been fighting to win back approval, ratings and whatnot. and i used to admire the hl2dm university. However i do not anymore, there are very nice people here who i speak to, like and get along with such as valar, pig popper, chicken etc.<br>
<br>
You on the other hand are doing nothing for this place except bringing it down.<br>
Shame on you and shame on your mentality.<br>

Do you (and all other hl2dm uni admins and members alike) actually think that having such a rude, sociopathic and calculating nasty person in theri mitsts is helping the community or game whatso ever, i think not.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now i am being blunt and moreso completely honest when i say this, you spoil the valiant efforts of the people who i admire for spending hours and weeks of their time making this place and the community grow.<br>
<br>
Why dont you just leave, go and troll at the face in the mirror. perhaps then you may get the responce you deserve.<br>
<br>
I dearly hope that when people read this, that even if they dont have the guts to admit they agree. that they can take on board what i have said here, and perhaps learn something from it.<br>

You've got to either ignore it, roll with it or get eaten alive.<br>

Yes there are many that do love this game and are trying to support it any way they can, but they are a small percentage of the overall number of FPS gamers, unfortunately.  It is shit on by people that play other games, particularly those that play CSS.    Those same CSS noobs come into HL2DM expecting to PWN everyone from day one just because they can get a few frags in CSS.   When they quickly learn that isnt the case, they just claim the game sucks and go back to CSS.  <br>

<br>
I hear that, and feel it too. and its a massive shame that this intensly fun game is being pushed aside.<br>
I truly love playing hl2dm and am quite addicted.<br>
<br>
I tried to come and present a new map seeing as i assumed this was the central place for the community to try to grow. and it is.<br>
<br>
I was completely shocked at the rudeness of some of its members though, yes ive been online long enough to know that there are so idiots out there who love to start flame wars. and i will never be defeated by them, nor will i take it to heart and get upset.<br>
<br>
Instead of actually providing constructive feedback, or even being freindly in the slightest i was truly shocked at the rudeness of some of the replies. namely The argumentaliser. I guess thats where he gets his name from.<br>
<br>
If thats the way that people get treated when they actually do something good by trying to map, socialise and contribute then what hope does it have?<br>
<br>
I am not upset at his words, nor am i offended personally. life goes on without having to worry about people like him.<br>
<br>
QUOTE: "Yes there are many that do love this game and are trying to support it any way they can" <br>
<br>
and i am one of those people, but comments putting people down like argumentalisers are just going to make people not want to come and contribute in the future.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Pseudonym thinks he has a good map that is fun to play that is his opinion.   Im sure there are some people that would enjoy his map.  <br>

Argumentalizer has his own opinions on what he thinks is a good map.  Orbzone doesnt fall within his critera for such, and Im sure some people agree with him.<br>

	<div class="content">Releasing this map is fine and dandy and I would of ignored the thread completely after looking at the screen shots, but you talked about it being used for competitive play. This made me feel that you thought you made something worthy of that. My opinion was solely based on the map from a competitive map stand point and the fact that it could be built in 10 minutes or less by a skilled mapper. I also don't like seeing mappers waste time with maps that are made for a specific crowd, like the puzzle maps. This map, to me, fits the bill and does nothing for the hl2dm community. This is my opinion and I feel pretty much the same way as Impala. Sorry, somebody has to be honest with you or you will never improve.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thank you miss chicken, as you are the only person (on here) who actually bothered to try the map and come talk to me rather than just judging by looks <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
I admire this and you for that.<br>
<br>
<br>
I also completely think that its possible to be a fan of puzzle, dm, jump and fancy looking maps with no real gameplay all at the same time. You dont have to be limited to one genre of enjoyment.<br>
<br>
For example, i like jumpmaps, combat maps and stuff like dm_amsterville (which doesnt play too well but is really fun to explore).<br>

It may make them more defined, it may not.<br>
<br>
The central teleporter takes you to two different places- on either side, and it alternates so once you go in it its destination changes until the nexttime.<br>
It takes you to a corner top on the opposite sides of the rpg cubes.<br>
<br>
Ive used pickrandom and pickrandomshuffle before but as this only has two different destinations it was quite simple. Thanks for sharing a link anyway though</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I haven't played your map in a vs yet, but I do think glass walls still involves tactics, since a player's sight is limited to a certain cone and even if he sees the enemy, the map can become mazy like and you never know when he's gonna pop up. I had in mind such a map a long time ago, with semi see through glass or even distorting glass if it were possible. I also think people that say this or that map could take 10 minutes to do should really start mapping and see how many problems you can encounter, beginner or advanced. Stop being ignorant and stop exaggerating. And I'm rly sry that people judge by looks first and then decide whether to play it or not.<br>
<br>
As for map types, I'm proud to say I tried them all and I like or even love them all, even the mad style of zombies type of play (except ctf, not enough maps, too many mag whores etc). I had a really long period of co-op also and may I say, puzzle and coop (and definitely ffa) can also be competitive and even good for practice. Like solving problems, teamwork, shooting mid-air antlions with xbow, escaping an antguard in coop, or do mad jump levels in puzzle, and some tbr puzzles have levels for grav nade and fast nade and pistol aim (u get higher and higher by constantly turning and shooting some barrels while in mid air ofc - awesome but hard) etc. Oh and I'd love one day to learn to surf right and why not, finish all the jump maps out there lol<br>

While we are at it, I've got a couple of questions<br>
<br>
How do I attach toilets to walls?  when I make a setting for "minimum force to override", it is unmovable by the ggun until something else knocks it.<br>
<br>
With a trigger_multiple, does a player have to enter it's area for trigger it, or can it just be around the area that the spawn in?  for example, if I were to make a giant box around the whole map would that work to start the trigger?<br>
<br>
If you've got a custom model in your map, how do you make it force the client to download it on a server, rather than have a big ERROR sign for them?<br>
<br>

You have to either use a plugin to force the download ( not recommended ), or you need to pack the custom models into the bsp file.  <br>

Tick the "Motion Disabled" and "Enable motion on Physcannon grab" flags and untick the "Generate output on +USE" flag.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Tranthor wrote:</cite>With a trigger_multiple, does a player have to enter it's area for trigger it, or can it just be around the area that the spawn in?</div></blockquote>

All depends which output you're using, ie OnStartTouch fires when a player moves into the trigger, OnEndTouch fires when a player leaves the trigger. Test 'em out and see which one gives you the effect you want <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I am not 100% sure as I am learning hammer as well, but if you build a box around each with a trigger brush then set the trigger to do whatever you want when someone hits the trigger.  The problem is, it will do it everytime someone hits the trigger:  ie even players walking by.  <br>
<br>
I am not sure you can do what you are trying to do, unless you build little chambers off the main box and have your player spawn in the chambers.  Put the trigger at across the entrance and when people leave the spawn chambers it will fire.  You can put some sort of one way force field at each entrance so that players can only go out and not go in.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
so, if I make small boxes set to OnEndTouch over each spawn, it sets everytime you walk through it, so I've gotta move the spawns.  Why didn't I think of that in the first place?<br>
<br>
For some reason, when my player_weaponstrip fires, nothing happens.  The trigger multiple is definitely triggering it, but it won't take away the weapons.  I think I can probably debug this though.<br>

	<div class="content">no. nope and naught.<br>
think of ep1 Source as a small child with comprehensive dysfunctions. most of what you're trying to do will bug out online and that's a fact. including your weapon_strip.<br>
anything that moves or has to do with moving will most proly fail online. this is one of ep1 Source's weakest points. leave it. trust me.<br>
try to lower your expectations of what HL2DM can do for you code wise and keep praying for the OB port.<br>
<br>
best thing for you to do about the having only some weapons and some not is this:<br>
<br>
put a point_server_command in your map and name it (for example: jonny)<br>
put a logic_auto in your map and go to its I/O and do the following outputs:<br>
<br>
1)<br>
<br>
OnMapSpawn<br>
Jonny<br>
Command<br>
sv_cheats 1<br>
<br>
2)<br>
<br>
OnMapSpawn<br>
Jonny<br>
Command<br>
ent_remove_all weapon_smg1<br>
<br>
1)<br>
<br>
OnMapSpawn<br>
Jonny<br>
Command<br>
sv_cheats 0<br>
<br>
do the same for other weapons<br>
<br>
to give the players weapons:<br>
grab this rar, unpack, open in hammer and modify the game_player_equip as you want. make sure to trigger it OnMapSpawn using your logic_auto - <a href="http://www.eyeclan.net/backup/player_equip_prefab.rar" class="postlink">DOWNLOAD</a> <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2 important notes:<br>
1- you'll see in this prefab also a trigger giving players weapons and a weapon_strip - i suggest you ignore those. as those as the ones that bug out online.<br>
2- the game_player_equip is edited in SmartEdit</strong><br>

	<div class="content">actually, every time I've been playing dm, I've been testing various beta versions of my map with friends, and also some random people who show up, on a listen server.  So far, no bug issues.  And everyone likes the giant melon.<br>
<br>
And actually, if I try it your way I wouldn't need to add any weapons; just remove smg and nades.  might be worth a shot.  You say it will perform better?  I suppose there also won't be issues when other players re-pass through spawns.  Right now, I've raised the spawn points off the ground so they will usually only be passed through if it's low grav.  And if you do go through a point again, it's only an issue if you are holding something at the time.  But i'll make the next version with your way and test it. <br>

edit: with the logic_auto will I need to put a "delay after trigger" for the ent_remove_all weapon_smg1 and then another longer one for sv_cheats 0? like, 0.1 seconds or something?<br>

you have two option really- either remove the weps using the logic_auto &gt; point_server_command<br>
or just put these cvars into your server.cfg<br>
<br>
these command are called upon on each map launch they work on the actual server. so it's beyond players' spawn to mess up / bug on. and yes, far more stable than using entities performing the cvars on-the-fly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">never had any problems in my beta7 version, where there was a small trigger_multiple around each spawn point which was raised above the ground to decrease likeliness of crossing it again.  Maybe you just need to make sure triggers are big enough to envelop the whole player?<br>
<br>
I think i want to try a logic_timer, and if that fails also, I will have to do it your way with the boxes.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help everybody</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This was a request made by my good friend and brother {EE}ζђΞMìζλ|ßůЯИ» to make him a Castle map.<br>
The project prolonged and stretched for ages on eons for many reasons but come now, having a life and artistic qualms aside, it's back under my Hammer and soon we shall have some betas up and running. Wo0t!<br>

Some screens for your anticipating pleasure in the meantime:<br>

The only possible problem with visuals may be that the map could be easy to get lost in for first-timers.

	<div class="content">It actually looks pretty sweet. On top of that, I like how it's like you're fighting on a real high castle, rather than on a killbox. Perhaps falling out of the castle = fall death?<br>
<br>
The only problem I can see relating to visuals and not how pretty it is is the silhouettes. On the second picture, the stairs seem to blend in with the walls, which may be a strainer for some of the older players here. However, the lighting and shadowing seem to define the architecture in the other screenshots well enough.<br>
<br>
Some ambient sounds would be killer for this map. Perhaps like a bell that periodically rings or sounds out whenever a certain weapon/door/item/whatever respawns.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">- added a balcony in the center of the castle. see 1st pic.<br>
<br>
- added a second main gate on the other side of the castle. see 2nd pic <br>
(this is the best pic i found that shows the area, though not an outside view)<br>
<br>
- added a rooftop sentinel room on the second most highest tower so it's not sniper alley anymore.<br>
<br>
- changed all the gates and doors with more authentic ones.<br>
<br>
hopefully i'm starting to get the flow work nicely having added the above so things should move faster from hereon.<br>

P.S. sry i didn't bother with screens this time lol.<br>

having said that - Chems castle is a major project and has been for well over a year. this is mainly a pub (FFA) map and as such it will be released. no ETA. but release it shall because i love the map, i really love chem and i'm a HL2DM diehard for life.<br>

I understand what you're saying, Val.  We have plenty of good maps by you and others that have been recently released and what ends up in tournaments?  The same old maps.  It's one of the things that pushed me to quti playing.  People are so damn afraid to step out of what they feel comfortable playing that this game will never progress into anything more than a lovable turd.  It's a shame all the time you and others spend making, testing, re-working, re-testing to put out such nice maps and it ends up going to waste.<br>
So if I were you, I wouldn't feel the slightest bit of remorse.  If L4D is providing the appreciation you need, then go for it and don't look back.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, this is a very interesting thread!!<br>
<br>
Thanks Chem for pointing out that [FF] is by far one of the most active clans in HLDM! 175 members, of which 62 are still very active in the HLDM game speaks for itself. I can't speak for other clans, but I can adamantly state that in [FF] our members truly appreciate and thrive on the new maps that are built, such as those that have been built and featured within this web site. <br>
<br>
I also believe that sometimes we get caught up in over-analyzing map quality to be honest.  Our criteria for a good to great map?  Does it have good performance , good connectivity, decent weapon and health placement and above all else.......is it fun to play!!  We continue to conduct monthly map tests, and we continue to have "fun" scrims with other clans.  The work that Valer has done, as well as all other mappers is truly appreciated within the [FF] ranks. I personally try to rotate as many new maps in the [FF] map cycle every 4-6 weeks as possible.  I rarely run the old default maps, unless it is by special request. <br>
<br>
So, I guess what I am saying is that whereas you may not see the appreciation for all of you mapping time to the level that is justified, at [FF] we have 175 members who thank you from our hearts and hope that you still find HLDM mapping enjoyable enough to continue!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

that was actually Dallas who said that, but i absolutely agree with him.  FF hands down has the best variety of maps in any server.  some IMO are too small for the 14 ppl allowed in, but for the most part, like 95% are great.  great ppl too. i love playing there when i do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hello all at HL2DMU, my name is Kyle and I am currently working on a finalized version of my first DM map, dm_villa. I've had a few people recommend that I upload at this site for some good constructive criticism. Currently this project is in its second beta phase, and I'm working on a third, if not final release.<br>

<br>
A small villa built into a tall cliff-face. Below it, there is a cave system that connects various points throughout the map. Gameplay is multi-level, and fairly fast paced as this is a relatively small map. There are multiple routes to all locations in the map, and every hiding spot is exposed from at least one angle, meaning that the players must keep on their toes at all times.<br>
<br>
This is a map best suited for anywhere from 2 to 8 players, spanning three levels: basement cavern, villa main floor, and the rooftop.<br>

jk of course lol <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
anyway, had a look. man wow what a beautiful work. reminds me a lot of dm_balcony in the sense of the careful attention to details but also in the sense that it's very much a pub map rather than a competitive one. <br>
<br>
my notes:<br>
<br>
quite a few too narrow paths / doorways - that's a given.<br>
some patches here and there of lack of light - can be fixed of course: add lights next to those.<br>
cubemaps aren't built on the LDR version mate?<br>
i would consider looking into some hinting, portaling andadding fade distances to props to help frames.<br>
<br>
Again - REALLY amazing map. and all stock materials!!! WOw i salute you! fine fine work.<br>
hope to see more beautiful dm from you in the future <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

	<div class="content">Hi  klyemar, i was up;loading the map and noticed that it size was around 48mb Oo<br>
very surprising for something with no custom content, a typical custom texture map is around 17mb.<br>
I then started a compile process thinking it would be a quick job and think i found the reason, your light maps are set very low, between 2 and 4  on almost all surfaces. <br>
Im gonna do a compile using 16light map scale, imo you'd do better to just pick the high detail areas for such low light map scales, such a large map size will put ppl off downloading.. fickle beast that they are <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
hit me up on steam when you online<br>
<br>
there's a interesting blog on teh blackmesasource site about using lightmaps if you can find it.<br>

	<div class="content">Very nice, attention to detail, realism in the house, clever use of increased lightmaps.  A superb effort to create a pretty little hideaway for deathmatch.  Only some minor issues I thought - <br>
<br>
Build cubemaps 256x256, as you have some very nice detailed areas to reflect on your windows.<br>
For me, I thought there could be a larger back garden area, to provide respite from the narrow corridors, which I think are very good because they induce a feeling of suspense, but variety is the spice of life.<br>
Finally one idea I had which could increase the kill rate on this map is a doorway between the two corridors in the picture below:<br>

	<div class="content">Perfect! This was the kind of feedback I was hoping for, very specific.<br>
<br>
I'm going to fix the lightmaps, I was hoping they wouldn't be too much of a burden but you're probably right. I downloaded the .bsp you uploaded Popper but I'm going to have to wait until tonight to give it a look through.<br>
<br>
I've had a few people mention the brightness of it, I think I must have my brightness set way high. I'm going to run through with my brightness lowered to see if that makes those dark spots more evident. I think in the future I'm going to just compile it in ldr as well to boost performance. I love the pretty graphics, but it's probably not doing people any favors.<br>
<br>
Another thing that I'm thinking about adding is a wide open room where the big doors in the courtyard are. It will be a storage room or something of the sort and will extend to the lower level hallway as well. It might be hard to explain but it's pretty much going to be three stories tall, this room, and it will connect to the roof and the basement as well. I don't know exactly how it's going to look just yet but I think having another wide-open space will be a good thing. I think expanding the backyard would be an improvement as well. I want to make it bigger and add some interesting cover.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">We play tested youre map yesterday on our server with a few players. And i/we must say its a very nice looking map. We have some points to mentioned , some are allready said but i shall give all the points we have.<br>
<br>
-To low fps on many parts off the map. i have a gforce 6600 (256mb) and at some parts it dropped to 15/20 fps. Even the guy with the newest card had to low fps on most parts of map.<br>
-The 2 pieces off rock on/through the roof does not fit in the map. Its looking strange how and where they are now. Replace the rock with a chimny or something.<br>
-In one off the cornes on the roof youre displacement does not fit against the wall next to it. Theres comming light from the back off youre rock now.<br>
-More open space in the villa. Its a bit narrow and only hallways in the villa.<br>
-Less smaller objects/ phycics in the villa . To much rubble now.<br>
-less slams. Its gonne be a slam party in the villa.<br>
- Mayby the skybox ceiling a bit higher. You can bounce frags on the ceiling to the other side off villa when you are on the roof.<br>
-More our personel point is that the appartment models in the 3d skybox looks out placed in those mountains. it does not fit the feeling you get in that mountain villa. Mayby just some trees/fog in there.<br>
in a other post off hl2dmu member screenshots will be placed.<br>

Overall its very good done.alot off good reactions off the players who where ingame.<br>

<br>
1. the slams are a bit over done i think a little to much people will get irratated by it. i like the idea  but just leave 1 in and make sure to put it down stairs to move them around the map to get them.<br>
<br>
2. some brushes are not connecting each other and looks weird its possible that you crash in heavy combat if you look at it. the game can be a pain in the ass i have a screenshot so you can see it. behind the tree <br>
<br>

<br>
3. that rock on the roof isnt realy nice there for 2 reasons i guess its a prop static if you touch it some times you bounce away realy annoying. i think like bunny said a chimney or somthing would be awsome <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
4. some places fps drops bad in the suit charger balcony at the smg nades dunno it just feels wierd. i only played the 17mb version maybe the 8 is mb is better <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> but i dunnno what it is<br>

	<div class="content">yup the FPS issue, i had that too.  on well built maps i get atleast 300, i think i was getting about 200 on yours but it dropped way down to 30 in some spots.  <br>
<br>
i would take the slams out.  get one player who's a dick and setting up slams everywhere and that match is done.<br>

By fast ladder do you mean the ladder brush?<br>

I'm officially back to work as of now, just working on a lot of the clipping issues right now, but because of all of the terrifically detailed feedback you all have been taking the time to give me I have a feeling that the third version will be <strong class="text-strong">drastically</strong> better in overall feel, look, and performance.

Im guessing they are just ladders made from brushes at a particular angle that causes the player to move up them quickly. I had to use them in cp_warpath and avanti for tf2 because tf2 doesnt have ladders. They dont do any good towards how a player looks going up them, but they get the job done in a tight spot where a ramp is impossible. Valve really should of went with the CSS approach towards ladders in hl2dm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well I've been knee deep in the muck for close to a week now and I've made some progress, at the expense of some blood, sweat and tears. I wanted to make an update, not only to mention what I plan on adding to the map, but I wanted to open myself up to any suggestions that anyone here might have. I don't have any competitive DM experience, just casual, which is made apparent by the cramped quarters of this map. That's why I'm overhauling three main portions of the map. <br>
I'm making the back yard wrap around the corner of the building, and now the yard will connect to the main entrance and front gate which is under construction right now. This frontal area will effectively triple the size of the back yard and add some realism to the map.<br>
I'm also planning on expanding the caves below the map and the area connecting to the man-made tunnel connecting the stairwells. If it works well, I'll have a large room accessible via the large double doors in the courtyard, that will connect to a similarly large storage room below. If it works properly, I will be able to add much more area that will be easily accessible.<br>
<br>
Enough rambling; I want to know if there's anything that more experienced DM players would like to see added to the map. What do most of you find fun in a "fun" map? What do you find frustrating in a map that can be easily avoided? I know I'm asking a lot, but I feel like first and foremost, this is a very collaborative process and more than anything I want to make something that I'm proud of that you would all have a blast playing as well. If you're able to take some time out to help, I would be most appreciative!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
Soon I'll have some pics to post, once I fix the huge gaping hole in one half of my map.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well, most(if not all of us) know how to bhop really well and we like to be able to do that to move around a map quickly.  if i recall correctly this map didnt give much space for this.  you can pretty much remove all slams, in competition play nobody uses them.  especially in a close quartered map like this.  if any of us join there during a pub match and ppl are laying slams all over the place, making it even more impossible to move quickly thru the map, 98% of us are going to just leave.  make the rpg accessable but not so easy to get that its whored, and dont place it in a spot that is the center control point on a small map such as this.  that will make it very easy for a good player to just camp there killing everybody with the rpg and not even have to move to reload it.  also on a small map like this you might want to limit the spam pick ups, that will hurt play aswell.  <br>
<br>
thats all i can think of ATM.  "what makes a map fun"?  ask Valar, he will tell you that you never know which maps will be successful and which wont.  plus from the get go of the map design you really need to decide which crowd you are catering to......pub style, KB, low grav, CAL, 1v1-----4v4?   as almost every mapper will tell you its pretty much an impossible task to cater to all of them, just doesnt work.  <br>
<br>
good luck with your map bro</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
- You got some unnecessary, narrow 180° U-turns that require too much turning around. You should shorten those and maybe turn them into wider 90° corners instead:<br>

<br>
- People will try to climb the ladder from this (wrong) side:<br>

How about turning the postion of the ladder by 90° (clockwise)?<br>
<br>
- Super-unimportant eye-candy issue: You can change the x-alignment of each stair's texture to make the pattern less repetitive:<br>

	<div class="content">I have to agree with Jake_brake. The problem could have been server side, butit does'nt happen in any other maps that I know of, and I can't think of a cause, but barrel explosions really lagged up the server. My only other suggestions would be to maybe expand the mid(ground)level outward in at least two directions. The map has a cramped feel to it. As far as quality of construction and build, it's really very nicely done. I admire your attention to detail, and for a first release, this one definitely stands out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

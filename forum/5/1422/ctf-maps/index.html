You've already got Revolution, 2Fort_R1, and Terminal_R1. Connectors can easily be votemapped into in the HAX server, as Neolinkster suggested. As for R1 maps, you're missing Warpath and maybe Well_r1, I don't recall if we ever released that.<br>
<br>
As for competitive CTF (good luck in your attempts to revive it), here are my opinions for each of the maps:<br>
<br>
2fort classical (b8b)<br>
The biggest complaint with 2fort was its stalemates. Unless one team was significantly advantaged or played a much better game, chances are that the scores will be stuck at 0:0. And even if one team did manage to cap, the strategy pretty much shifts to a full-on 5-man defense turtle. This is complemented due to the rather defensive architecture of the map (at least in TFC you had concs and other crazy jumps), fast weapon spawn times, and poor weapon placement (RPG and orbs in basement and spawning with 2 SMG nades, are you kidding me?).<br>
<br>
2fort Cartel (ctrl1)<br>
It uses fast times so you're guaranteed 100 armor, but it removes all the spam together. I'm pretty sure this would be much more accepted than b8b amongst euros who generally dislike spam. Still somewhat turtlish, but it's manageable.<br>
<br>
2fort Revised (r1)<br>
I believe this version CALLS for the most teamwork, strategy, and coordination to be successful. Everything is on a slow timer, so dying actually matters. Your team must choose how to handle their base's resources carefully, and defending consists of more than just camping your basement because the RPG is under the bridge and the orbs under your stairwell, two generally unseen places in b8b and crtl1. Health and armor is scattered around, so you may want to consider those when playing on defense as to starve your enemies of resupplies in your own base. The crossbow becomes more useful in this aspect as well. Although this version may be the most "competitive", it was generally disliked amongst clans who really enjoyed the fast-paced, spammy action of b8b.<br>
<br>
2Fort Sniper<br>
No.<br>
<br>
Avanti<br>
Avanti is pretty much a spam and speed test of orbs, RPGs, SMG nades, and bunny hopping. Even then, Avanti was pretty fun because there are almost never any stalemates and playing defensively was tough once you ran out of ammo. Despite not being included in CAL CTF (or so I recall), I think this kicks the bucket out of other CTF maps for competitive play. And no, Avanti is not really a CTF map, moreso as TFC.<br>
<br>
Bedroom Warfare<br>
I never liked these rat CTF maps, but I have not a big idea on how it'll play out competitively. The fast respawns, easy access to spam, and the huge size without any speed boosters kinda leads me to a negative opinion of this map.<br>
<br>
Connectors<br>
Connectors wasn't included either in CAL CTF, but it's definitely better than, say, 2fort sniper. When played with SLOW respawns, there's some possibilities for resource management and whatnot. Flag running isn't impossible either, but it can be either a cakewalk or rather tough depending on the enemy's defense. With that said, I think connectors can be quite dynamic.<br>
<br>
Lockdown<br>
Wtf.<br>
<br>
NFS<br>
I do recall that NFS was rather spammy with SMG nades. If it was edited with spread out weapons/items and such (and given more than one texture), I think this map would be very good for teamplay. Otherwise, it's meh.<br>
<br>
Outlaws Sanctuary<br>
Never seen this one.<br>
<br>
Pedestal<br>
No, not for 5v5. 2v2 at most.<br>
<br>
Portal Storm<br>
Never seen this either. Is it Tenshi's map?<br>
<br>
Revolution<br>
Kind of a disaster unless everyone knows the map and knows how to use the speed tools. The different CTF flag system allows for a dynamic offense/defense play. There's some resource management to be considered as well due to slow respawns. I think Revolution can play out as a skillful map if everyone knows it though.<br>
<br>
Rock2<br>
Absolute turtle fest. Fast spawns, RPGs, smg nades, orbs, it just doesn't work out.<br>
<br>
School<br>
Remove the spam and it'll be a solid map. In it's current state, it plays out like 2fort except better. The flag room is a clutterfest, but it's easier to get into and out of, and the map doesn't have just one chokepoint.<br>
<br>
Terminal (r1)<br>
Think of 2fort r1 and Revolution put together. It allowed for a dynamic offensive/defensive flag play, even some hide and seek, and a lot of resource management with each different path providing something useful.<br>
<br>
Warpath (b4b)<br>
Spam spam spam, rocket rocket rocket, bunny hop bunny hop bunny hop.<br>
<br>
Warpath (r1)<br>
Same to a lesser extent, except it's actually possible to push on because of resources, spawn time, and lack of spawning with RPGs. Also, it allows for some strategy involving weapons, a detpack, and turrets.<br>
<br>
Well (b3e)<br>
Remove the damn RPG on the roof, wow. It kills the map. Without it, the map plays like a better version of 2fort b8b cause it lacks insta-SMG nades and whatnot. Without the RPG, Well is the least spammiest of Kusa's maps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

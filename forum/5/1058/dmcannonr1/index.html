	<div class="content">The same guy that made dm_scepter and dm_amplitude recently made a map called dm_cannon.  Well it didnt work.  It would load onto the server but the clients would get a missing map error and get disconnected.  <br>
<br>
I emailed him about this a couple of months ago and after a couple of different revisions, he now has a version that works!<br>
<br>
I loaded it to my server and had a look around.  Like his other two maps, the architecture is awesome and the map is quite maze like.  But there are lots of weapons, health and suit in the map.  Overall I think its another great map.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have reported back to him that this version was a success and told him that he should load it up to fpsbanana as soon as he can.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I will answer this question at some point but its fairly long, I have been meaning to get a write up about what is looked for and avoided in a map for CAL.  <br>
<br>
As for amplitude. <br>
The first season of CAL we went looking for maps and scepter came up and led us to amplitude. We found out they were both made by the same mapper and he was willing to work with us to make them better which included extra clipping, removing mines, making those 10 hp health packs into 25 hp packs or condensing 2 into 1. And other minor things. We did not want both maps since both are similar in architecture and play style. We want the league to have a unique selection of maps which complement different play styles. <br>
<br>
We felt Amplitude was the better choice because the rocket was down low where it was weak rather then up high, and it was big enough to handle all 3 leagues. However at the time the 1v1 admin was really heavily into arena maps and didn't like anything much bigger so amp was left out of 1v1.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">To extrapolate on fearsomes comment, maps of all shapes and sizes were available in season one of the 1v1, including several as large and rambling as amplitude. Most saw little play, and many of the matches that were played stagnated into campfests that ended with 1:0 type scores. The majority of the arena maps had the opposite problem, too much nonstop action with little to no strat or thought involved, and as such both types of map have been mostly phased out of the league (aim arena being the exception due to its massive popularity, as it has been chosen and played almost as much as all other map combined during every season).<br>
<br>
What the 1v1 division looks for in maps now is a balance of strategy, reaction, movement, aim and spam, with good flow / layout and a size to match all of the above requirements. The ability to fix or edit the map if needed is also a weighing factor, as is the potential for a long-term, high skill ceiling regarding the maps gameplay options.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Now who was I telling 1-2 years ago that CAL needed to put aim arena in CAL 1v1??</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Who are you talking to? I'm not even running this contest and the judges will come from every clan there is in hl2dm (from $w to emO to Xs to LsD). Do you think I'm really going to donate $75-100 with only one person in mind? I mean really, I'm not going to donate my time and my money to make some sham contest, I'm doing this because I want to see one or two last great maps for this community.<br>

I have no idea where all this hatred is coming from? I'm offering my time (which I have barely enough of anymore) and my money and I get a whipping for it?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I deleted some of your post to highlight the irony...I am doing my best to promote the game, I am running a league, convincing people to come back to hl2 or play it again and the person who bashed me here without care to facts was you, you called me a dumbass. All the maps being played now (LA,Caverns,Airfusion and Mileau) in CU are the result of map competitions with the exception of LD_R5. That was only season 1, other newer maps are being floated around now.<br>
<br>
You again preach against things you just did, starting a flame war and calling me by a derogatory reference and that you're tired of a community of talk, well here I am, offering action, offering money.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">I personally believe that the dm community can be ressurected partly by new maps.  BUT - not by new maps which are unused.<br>
<br>
Valar is correct in what he said - it is through careful observation of useful tools such as tsgk's consortium stats that I <span style="text-decoration:underline">know</span> that old maps are still played more than new maps in general.  New maps have become popular too however.<br>
<br>
So, what is the solution? I say in principle a contest is good.  The contest I want to see is a rules of submission controlled by the public.  The public (which is roughly the readers of this forum, however I think through the steam community such a contest can be spread accross) submit what they want from a map.  This can be in terms of:<br>
<br>
Looks / atmosphere - (more L42D equivalent looks, Dm is looking dated but with good mapping you can still produce an amazing looking map that will match the latest games).  I know this because vtfedit can produce textures without loss of quality by using the correct filters.  Default filter will produce jagged textures.  Better filters will produce great quality textures, although these will increase bsp file size.  However I think that this is now less of a problem because of better internet connections.<br>
<br>
Gameplay - The community know what they want.  I will stick my neck out and say that honestly I don't think a team of judges who can design their own rules and judge to their own standards can benefit dm better that the community.  I say this because the mapping standards of a team of judges does not represent the community as a whole, it never can.  This does not mean that the judging team has bad standards, it may have great standards but it is the community who can contribute varied and representative requests for new mapping standards.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So this is how it can be achieved:<br>
<br>
Introduce the mapping contest idea to the steam community.  Invite the community to participate by requesting how they want new maps to be like.<br>
<br>
Then the mappers who entered make their maps.  <br>
<br>
The mappers submit their maps and post them anonymously to hl2dmu.  <br>
<br>
The community is allowed instant access to the download site once all maps are submitted.  This way dm is benefitted more quickly right?<br>
<br>
The winner I think is of no consequence.  You could judge by which map gets the most downloads, or features on the most servers, or is played by the most players.  This is not important.<br>
<br>
What is important is that dm benefits.  A download site filled with all the submitted maps on a level playing field, available to the steam community, which despite its problems is an efficient way of bringing millions of players together.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I get it Sadist, I'm trying to say I want these maps to be incorprorated into CU eventually, all of them whether they win or lose. Winner designation will only guarantee high traffic for your map and a likely place with many teams as their new designated home map. Judges wont be able to put their wants ahead of the map makers nor the community as the judges only get to see the result of what you wanted at the end, the only input they would require of you is if we agree there needs to be vital changes made if you would like to see your map come into serious consideration as a potentially winning competitive map. If you dont want to budge on changing it then leave it, we may select it anyway in a majority.<br>
<br>
The ONLY rule of this contest is the map has to be competitive in nature, because CU wants to see competitive maps only, and so do I. I'm not disagreeing with the rest, I think its fairly easy to make a forum about what people want to see in maps, and I can do that in CU before we commence the contest. I think interest is gaining here but its not quite enough yet, 5 map makers so far expressing interest...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok then we are agreed, the CU forum on feedback will provide an outline for desired styling of maps (THOUGH I REALLY DOUBT KILLBOX WILL BE THE DESIRED STYLE  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> ) . Also agreed on 10+ mappers being required, standing at 5 right now. Though I said Sunday will be my line drawn for this thread I can extend it a few more days if say we have 8 mappers on Sunday night, we can wait a few more days for those last two. <br>

I will only put up forum map feedback when we get the said number of mappers interested.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Oh god what have I done, I was really hoping to have someone else organize this... Yeah if I can't find anyone else to organize it me and you will setup a steam page, we'll just be intern admins until we find an organizer anyway if we get the mapper requirements. (still praying someone wants to step up for us).<br>

I will say that HL2DMU will not be running any further mapping contests for the game. This decision is based on the impact of previous contests and the amount of work involved in coordinating the contest. If someone on the forums wants to arrange a contest of their own, that is fine with me, I will even provide a private forum for the judges. It will not be an official HL2DMU event however.<br>
<br>
Regarding active admins here at HL2DMU, I think we do have some active admins here. I actually agreed to promote other admins who have shown interest. My apologies to those people, I keep getting distracted by other things. I do have some IRL stuff going on, and I am involved in other games now as well. This does not mean HL2DMU is going anywhere or that I will not return to play, but it does make it hard to put the same amount of energy into the site as I did previously.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

that was exactly my point.  it seems rediculas to have a community mapping contest that focuses on league play comp maps when, 1: the last contest was based on that focus and seems only one of those maps is being used in league play.  2:much more ppl are playing pub maps now, if this is truly a contest to bring the community together dont focus its intent on league maps.  3: the past has proven the new maps dont make it into the leagues anyway.  4: many more mappers will get involved if the maps are pub style, and the contest map pack will be much more successful.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Every single map that has a download link and is non-killbox or non-fort was allowed to be used in CU, all you have to do is suggest it with a link and it will be put into the database. Furthermore just because ethic is there doesnt mean anyone will pick it.<br>
<br>
@ CHem, every contest has produced a map that has and is being used in leagues. I am not going to donate $100 dollars to see it go to a killbox or pure pub map plain and simple.<br>

Also valar for all that BS you preached about not starting flame wars, you throw up sarcastic remarks about my intentions of donating $100 dollars from my own pocket for somehow a malicious intent is ridiculous.

I don't make shitty maps like wall-marts (I like to make balanced maps, slightly large) but I totally agree with some people who posted before about most of the population that play dm still, play on CAL or normal larger maps not CU competitive maps.<br>
<br>
But just look what HL2DM University has done for the default arrangement of maps, almost every server with custom maps have got the top 3 winners of every competition that was held. Pueblo, airfusion, helix, caverns etc. <br>
I only suggested this because I believed that if we got 3 more good maps before this game dies maybe the game will last a little longer.<br>

<br>
Rather than set a deadline how about simply waiting until there's enough interest then starting off? If there isn't enough interest then you've lost nothing and giving it some time stands to give you more interested mappers in the long run.<br>
<br>
Also don't forget about the steam forums for hl2dm and Mapping/SDK there's a lot of regulars on there who you wont find here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">For the posts in the 1st two pages, I think a mapping contest is always a good thing. There's always new maps comming up, a contest will only promote action and speed things a little bit more, while mappers will get on with their other works later on and more maps will come up still. I think every little thing is good for the community. <br>
<br>
One of the biggest problems is that CU (and CAL had the same problem) seem to be late in time, and ppl are playing the same maps over and over for years and years. New maps became popular but they aren't as promoted as they should. I ask my friends many times if they played pueblo, and guess what, no one knows it. We have many GREAT mappers around that have made MANY GREAT and potentialy competitive maps and I rarely see them being played.<br>
<br>
And then ofc, like valar said, this community is all fucked up. CU forums, for example, seem like a kindergarden full of little kiddies bashing each other like retards, many players are just retards that don't have enough sportsmanship to loose (or even win) a match (and the ones that are respected by them don't do anything to shut them up), many players don't resist the temptation of using a fucking wallhack cuz they will not sleep at night if they loose, even if it's in a freakin pub... etc<br>
<br>
Noobs don't get to know this or other websites related to the game, they keep playing shitty servers with retarded settings and retarded maps, and they eventualy loose interest in this. Ofc this community gets smaller and weaker, I'm only playing for 2 years and a month, and tbh I'm getting sick of it. The players, the maps, the bugs, the leagues (even tho I don't compete), the servers...<br>
<br>
I won't participate in the competition, most likely I won't have any good ideas, like always, but I will help spread the word for sure. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
Good luck on it. Hope you make it.<br>

The Steam Group speaks for itself.  An attractive first few lines of text is all it takes to pull people in.  And if everybody invites all their friends to the group it will spread very far.  I've also given the hl2dmu forum link in the main page.  So far we have 4 comments that speak about what the community want to see in new maps.<br>
<br>
Maybe if Valiums would be kind enough to begin an official thread for map feedback from the community please? The I can also link people to that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's because I asked ORACLE [admin of senior slayers] to post a comment and I got pernicious to tell me what he thought.<br>
Though I just copied and pasted what he said because he refused to post it himself. He thought it would be better if you just left it in the forum. <br>

	<div class="content">hi there.. <br>
<br>
i really appreciate the amount of time n hard work some of u guys spend for hl2dm<br>
and there was a time not long ago, when i would have loved to join a contest..<br>
but i think i´m not going to join in..<br>
<br>
maybe i should keep my fingers away from the keys.. but by readin all those posts i have to say<br>
(and don´t get me wrong the following is just my opinion)<br>
<br>
reasons why i maybe not going to join are.. <br>
burn out, no ideas.. <br>
wrong timing .. summer is near<br>
buisness crisis is good as over, don´t have much time now,<br>
missing support+feedback on releases in the past, <br>
even ppls who play for a long time seems not to be able to give constructive feedback, <br>
moan about everything is all i hear, all u "poor" minds can do, is throw mud on work of others who care?? damn sad<br>
(except a handfull of ppls, u know who u are... no names needed)<br>
<br>
another thing i don´t understand is the discussion in here about <br>
Competitive/League maps, Killboxes, and/or Pub/Regular maps..<br>
<br>
cause in my eyes a good map is a good map.. <br>
just a game to have fun with.. <br>
nothing more, nothing less..<br>
and its all subjective impression in the end<br>
<br>
oh n sry for my bad english.. not my mother language<br>
but i wish all you guys who care, good luck <br>

the whole point of the previous map contests was to produce non-linear/non-symmetrical maps that are used for competition on standard settings. I think this new contest is going for the same thing.<br>
<br>
also: i'm probably not going to submit a map if the required number of mappers is met.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

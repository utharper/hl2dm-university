That's partly due to the way env_lightglow works. I suggest trying an env_sprite, set it's render mode to world space glow then play around with scale, color, etc.<br>
<br>
(Glow = stays the same no matter your distance from it / World space glow = actually has a position in the "world" and doesn't stay the same size).<br>
<br>
It should look very similar if you tweak the opacity and such, the best way really is just to play around with both of them and see which one works for you. <br>
<br>
Make yourself a 1024x1024 box map with a light to test it and slap a few variations of env_lightglow / env_sprite settings in there then you can compare them quickly and easily and work on the effect you want <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Paradox wrote:</cite>

</div></blockquote>

Works like this:<br>
<br>
Until you build cubemaps anything that has specularity (reflectiveness) will reflect the default cubemap (default skybox).<br>
<br>
The default cubemap is a white sky so on highly reflective surfaces (like some glass textures) it will look very bright until you replace the cubemaps with ones built from your actual level geometry and lighting.<br>
<br>
You may find that you get the perfect effect you are after only to find that when you build (darker) cubemaps it looks all wrong again. Just a heads up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Righty let's see if we can get this working for you. Best way to deal with any hammery problem I find is work through it step by step.<br>
<br>
Head back to your box test map and try this:<br>
<br>
1) Add nothing but one env_sprite, one light and one info_player_deathmatch all with default settings.<br>
<br>
2) Compile and run the map, see if your sprite is working ok.<br>
<br>
3) Add your sphere, make it into a func_brush with solidity = never solid and shadows = off and set your sprites glowproxysize.<br>
<br>
4) Compile and run the map see if the sprite is still visible through the sphere.<br>
<br>
5) Texture your sphere and tweak colours, opacity etc to suit.<br>
<br>
If you get stuck with stuff not working at any point we have then found the point of failure and can look more at that, just shout.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
The problem was not the sprite per se(although for some reason I wasnt seeing my sprites).<br>
<br>
The main problem was the texture of the sphere.  Brunt didnt use a glass texture, but instead he used an animated texture from the models section.<br>
I figured this out by seperating the 3 things (light, sphere and sprite) in Brunts map and then compiled and ran the map.  That was where I saw the sphere was making the main effect, not the sprite.<br>
<br>
Anyway I got it to work and tweeked it to pretty much what I want.<br>

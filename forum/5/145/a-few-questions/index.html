	<div class="content">i got a shit load of questions about hammer, i've just started but i've advanced pretty far, so you don't have to reply back with a bible like description.<br>
<br>
my water in a dark lit room stands out like a red headed hooker at a ballroom dance, working on a different map (and spending more time with hammer) i've noticed that the texture painter thingy has the "lightmap" scale option, would adjusting this help? i've added cubemaps... but maybe i'm not understanding them entirely.....<br>
<br>
what the hell is with the AR2 ammo? i've noticed that even tho it says error in the editor, it works perfectly fine in the map... but still... c'mon?<br>
<br>
last one for now:<br>
recently i downloaded golden eye source, which is great, and has some very nice looking levels, most of the indoor environments echo gun fire and other sounds... how do i manage to do something like that?<br>
<br>
thx to anyone who helps me, i've been learning hammer for about 3 weeks now and have very little experience with Unreal ED, but i've come a long way and am even more dedicated toward learning more, but google can only answer my questions correctly when i know wtf im asking.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm still a bit new at map making as I have only been doing it for a few months, but I do know that if you change the lightmaps, it will make the compiling and downloading of the map less expensive (smaller).  I think one of the better tutorial sites out there would have to be SnarkPit, but I'll post more links later.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

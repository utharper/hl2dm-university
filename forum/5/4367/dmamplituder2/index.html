<br>
You can download the map here. <br>
The main changes are.<br>
Spawning with both stun stick and crowbar removed.<br>
Smg nade and orb near rocket moved further away to facilitate more movement and  draw combat to the center of the map. <br>
2 armor chargers at the top to draw combat to the center of the map. <br>
The map should not crash during restarts anymore.<br>
The mapper added HDR without me even asking so don't blame me for this. <br>
Various landmarks were added to the map so that people can more easily distinguish areas some people found it hard to know where they were in the map. <br>
<br>
Overall all the changes seem to be good and it played great. <br>
Please replace R1 with this map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It is a great TDM map you guys should try it I think the guy who made it is actually from Germany<br>

They should be, I am sure some people will find some flaws but certainly less then many other competitive maps and it is a great improvement over r1</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nobody is saying that the community doesn't want good new maps. However, fixing popular maps or maps that are good for competition just makes sense. The most notable fix from r1 to r2 is the removal of the stunstick bug, which everyone can agree is not only annoying, but causes crashes on mp_restartgame and prevents people from spectating without disturbing the team score. If someone wants to fix a map to make it play better, great. If someone wants to make a brand new map that plays good, even better.  I think valar's remorse should be included in future leagues as well as the many other creations he's made, which may need some more tweaking, but are perfectly good candidates for leagueplay. So I don't see the point in bitching about trying to improve maps, because it only makes the game better to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nobody is going to change what maps are popular overnight. There are some maps that have stood the test of time and have proven themselves to be decent competitive maps in leagues and scrims where good games can be had. This is probably why they keep resurfacing in leagues, which isn't necessarily a bad thing either. I believe having some of the same maps helps people really learn that map's tactics and can therefore concentrate on improving other aspects of their game. However, the new maps that are coming out are all good looking maps with a lot of potential, but just don't have the seasons of experience and fine tuning that veteran maps have had. This is why maps that have "r2, r3, r19, rwhatthefuckever" continue to stick around, but new maps sometimes get the INITIAL cold shoulder. People have high standards now. It is a problem, but it has a solution. DONT GIVE UP ON THE NEW MAPS. Put them in you server's rotation. Continue to work with the mapper. Use their maps in scrims.  Give them honest feedback about how the map could have played better and then pretty soon, you'll see the type of maps that you've been wanting to see in leagues.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I agree with Rico on this.  High standards my ass, there is no such thing.   Some of the maps we have been playing for years SSSSUUUUCCCKKK!!!!!  Everyone knows it.  People cant be bothered to learn new maps because OMG it might be a challenge, it might be fun or HEAVEN FORBID, we might lose because we haven't played the map 1,000,000,000,000 times.  So yea we keep playing the same old shit and most of the community is getting stoned bored and dont want to play it any more.  Ive tried putting new maps in my server rotation.  People come in, play for 5 minutes and they say OMG this sucks, put Lostvillage on...pppfffftttt.  And yes thanks to that attitude, the game's most prolific and most accomodating mapper is making maps for L4D.  Isnt that just fucking awesome!!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

ldr5 changed some things. Some were good, some were bad. Maybe another revision will prove the most successful yet, pending a better vent solution and weapon layout.<br>

Well this is a common attitude, but I think it has a lot to do with who's doing good on what maps at the time. People hate ld and zeta because sw is good at it, people hate lv because 911 is good at it, people hate caverns because ewr is good at it. True para, certain old maps may "suck", but its because teams have specialized in that map. People are never going to reach a consensus on a map if one team continues to perform well at it. New maps that come out give everyone a chance to declare their supremacy there, which is ok but not the primary goal of new maps. A new map is made to bring new life to the game, not to demonstrate that a team can easily adapt to a map that already fits their exact style of play. A good map brings a type of game play that can benefit more than just good aimers or ball spammers or (insert static play style here). The game is versatile ffs! It has more than just a shotgun or magnum. It has a multitude of possible weapons and play styles, including physics. Speaking of which, why do most new maps dis include physics or only have a handful of shitty props? I thought that this was the main reason we were playing hl2dm, for the unique physics engine. I mean hell, if people don't want to see physics in maps, there's tons of games more suitable for FPS like quake or CS:S that do not include the gravity gun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, I find this whole conversation interesting........<br>
<br>
Speaking for myself, and in understanding I run two pub servers, I am always looking for new maps, or at least maps I have not run on my servers before.   All I expect from a map is that is has decent performance, and decent gameplay and connectivity.  I am not a killbox/dome fan, but I do run some killboxes where the mapper has used some imagination to get away from the same old 4 square wall theme!  With that being said, we have good player activity on our servers and many return over and over again because they like the new maps.  This is the feedback we hear constantly.<br>
<br>
Granted, overly competitive, professional players only come around because our servers usually have a good crowd, but we really don't need that type to have a good player group who is really there to just frag a little and have fun. <br>
<br>
I am always looking for new maps.  If a remake is done like what is feature in this thread I think that is great, and I appreciate the mappers time to improve things. But, I also prefer new maps with new ideas that put players into a totally new environment where the mapper has used their imagination.  <br>
<br>
So, in the end, I appreciate all mapping efforts, both new and remakes, as I feel like the individual responsible is trying to help the community in both cases which is a damn good thing!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

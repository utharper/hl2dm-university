	<div class="content">HI all, <br>
<br>
i have a very early beta that id like some feedback on<br>
<br>
It's kinda a homage to a map called <a href="http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/23876" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline">dm_feudal</span></a> at least that's part of my inspiration. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Lighting </strong>is a mess (hdr is over powering atm)  if you wanna comment about that be specific please, but I will be toning it down and adding more internal lights soon<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Weapon </strong>layout is not that solid yet, i dont think its ready for playtesting tbh<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Layout </strong>is what im most interested in at the mo, better to get input earlier on I think <br>
at least in this map. any ideas for twists n turns plz <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

	<div class="content">A pretty nice map. I think the very lower level passageways are a little narrow and as you said lighting needs work, esp down there. I think this could be a very nice 1v1 map if it was only the very top level and the one below it, you could still have the rpg drop tube just eliminate that mid level and the very low levels, other than that it would be fine for 2v2 or more as it is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The one and only thing to me that defines feudal as a map is the top where you can fall off the side which was typical of a certain genra of maps from HLDM where they felt begin able to go up to the top of the map and camp was great. Personally I think it is senseless and imbalenced. I think this map suffers from that. You are going to get the rocket and be teleported up top with a birds eye view of the whole place. I say teleport the guy strait into the open middle of the map below say thats he is cannon fodder for everyone in the passages sniping out. <br>
<br>
Also decouple the map from feudal and and lose the fall off the top and wide open top theme. either break the top up making it another layer of the map with walls and obstacles to go around or block it off compeltely. I like the first idea better. <br>
<br>
On more practicle nots I would like to see how physics will play a role in this map<br>
I would like to see the reset timing on the lifts faster so the next person can run up and jump off them in short time. I would also like to see them faster and have lifts down in the basement that can pop you up to the next level and make a good clay pidgen for people to pick off. <br>
<br>
The theme of the map is solid finding good rusty physics to go with it will be nice. But I am sure after tweaking it will go well. <br>
<br>
Also thier is a flight of sort of steps near 2 pillars in the middle area which you must jump duck up each flight to go up after all that work you get nothing or could have just taken a lift. <br>
<br>
Another issue is the middle level of the map that goes around the map does not have any sort of catwalks or objects which let you move from one side of the map to the other without going all the way around at that level. It would be nice if the height of some of the objects was lowered to allow for this. Same with th 2 pillars outside I jump onto them and cannot jump onto the roof of the map from them. Also nothing is on them to make me bother jumping on to them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">k,  I finally checked this out.  Very cool.  And you got those cncr textures to work.<br>
Having issues getting the spinning rpg after the first pickup. <br>
I can't wait to see what this will look like with more lights in the lower levels! <br>
I know this was an homage to feudal, but I'm not a fan of falling off maps and dying either.<br>
Although technically I didn't die when I fell off... On the other hand, I have no problem with teleporting to the top with the RPG. But that's ultimately up to you. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"> <br>

<br>
Love the textures and colors!! I think this map could easily handle 8 players or so.  Like Brunt, I really don't mind falling off maps, but I do prefer configurations where when you do, you re-spawn.  Keep up the great work!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

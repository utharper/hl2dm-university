	<div class="content">well i was playing on tsgk, last night and scar, invx, blas all joined and it was some fun games..... i don't mind those tsgk kill box maps that aren't completely open and have some jump pads to get around on... don't care for the low grav but it's not that bad since you don't hang in the air forever.  But I was thinking what if you had a remake of a stock map into a large killbox map.  With jump pads to get around the large areas and different ledges and stuff to keep the flow going.  Image a Lockdown thats2 or 3 times as big killbox style but with jump pads around to make it just about as fast to get around....<br>

IDK randomly came to me while playing,  might be fun might be stupid, might bring some killbox players and regular players together. your thoughts?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It needs to be tested. Basically maps like LD (or any other stock map) are so packed with details it's crucial to block visibility otherwise the map lags. Once you take off the roof and let the player view the whole map you’re basically doing just that.<br>
<br>
And another thing...i personally like both styles however (there are actually more than two styles of map in dm and in general but anyway) i think generalizing this into a Group #1: Killbox players. Group #2 <strong class="text-strong">regular</strong> players. is not the best definition imho since it sort of offends killbox players. It assumes killbox and those who love it are not “regular” = as in the status quo of the game (?). correct me if I’m wrong but this is how it sounds from your post nino.<br>
I do realize some bhoppers indeed see themselves as "real" players while killbox or non-bhoppers are not..and further more...some may feel the HL2DM community consists of only bhoppers....in which case…someone like myself is not part of this community. .  ..<br>
i think it only adds to the division not to mention it is simply wrong.<br>
 i AM NOT trying to open a flame war or offend anyone here but i respect both types of gameplay and players and I personally know there are some truly awesome players out there – on both sides  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> .<br>

	<div class="content">Actually, I take no offense at being a killbox only player.  There have been two styles of games since HLDM.<br>

It's the same as space maps (to me) in Q3, mostly open and fast paced.<br>

It's truly a different game.  A lot of people that I know I originally met in the box.  ninjins (former name left out <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> ), WT, KT, .conflict, Neo, Juice,  ...<br>

Both regular and killbox HL2DM have good and bad maps.  But most only know killbox by the low gravity poorly made maps.<br>

	<div class="content">naw i know plenty of kb players and people that play both, same as ctf players some just prefer one style or the other ,  i have always enjoyed kb for it's fast paced gameplay and all out ffa's,  Althou i also enjoy small stock maps which places more importantance on movement and out smarting your enemies or where you will show up at.  Amp_r1 is a great example.   where you can get behind people quickly and attack from 4 or more angles at any given time.   <br>
<br>
I was just thinking of how to bring the styles together somehow,  As these KB's players are a big source of talent in the community as many have gotten pretty good, some have joined the ranks of the stock/cal players.  Some have stuck with Kb.   Much like with plenty of CTF players that are a big reason we kept sta going back in the day,  and still have CAL going which is due to ctf and kb players joining stock play aswell.<br>
<br>
So after doing a few scrims with a few kb clans that didn't enjoy playing stock i was thinking if some sort of bridge could be made with a map, that combined the two styles.  a large killbox map that has control areas .... and cover...<br>
<br>
so, i don't mean anything by any term.  I just know there is a bunch of good players that only enjoy the larger killbox maps or larger snipe maps that could do well in cal etc</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

me neither. i was only referring to this in this way since i have heard voices who speak of KB in such a tone. i heard that more than once. quoting one if i recall...a sig that went something like low grav KB - WTF thats not real DM. i honestly dont remember who was it. but i do recall the sig  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

<br>
well like on amp_r1 the rocket area you want to control but it's hard because attacks have about 6 ways to get there and it's low on the ground,  Or on this tsgk map the charger is on top in a corner,  with a 357 on the other side making it a good spot to get kills from but hard to hold because of the jump pads and how close it is to the ceiling.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you make it to low people don't like getting shot easily out of the air, also making it to high you won't get the kb players to play it all, maybe something like what EE has on their server, maybe a little lower tho<br>
<br>
the idea for a map tho would be to have some corridors on the sides and on the floor of a box. either way your gonna have to keep some big area for the kill box (which is mainly what it is)<br>

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I DONT PLAY KILLBOX! NEVER EVER! MUST'VE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE! lol j/k but man the days of the nitro_tater were some of the best times I've had. I remember playing gdawgg_platform with my friend matt you and queef inhaler! <br>
<br>
Wouldnt these opened stock maps just be more like arenas than killboxes?<br>

Good idea though nino, I'm sure this could bring killbox players and stock map players TOGETHER!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

very prejudice and quite wrong <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> . not all KBs look horrible. not only TSGK KBs are good (see TKO maps, see Pig Popper's, etc). killbox players don't hate RPG in general.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Basically any map we used to call an arena they call a killbox now</div></blockquote> Killbox the game style and map name has been around at least since HLDM (as in HL1). and who is "we"?<br>
putting a big X on a whole subject doesn't mean anything but the fact one is generalizing and that's wrong.<br>
<br>
BTW i absolutely love the 2vs2 KB cup idea. i think we should do this in the US also.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It may be prejudiced but it's not wrong. In the real world you do not have to be 100% correct almost nothing ever is. But 90% of killbox maps look horrible, and that good enough for me, I didn't say these are absolute rules but they do seem to be general stereo types which match consistently in my experience. <br>
<br>
I can make a 2v2 or 3v3 or 4v4 or whatever cup for in CAL. But the thing is we tried to run a killbox before in 1v1 and no killbox players played. The nature of the killbox community now in HL2DM is to make things different, cater them to your play style then you can win, others cannot and so do not play with you. This is why there are thousands of variants on the same simple map. If we run a killbox league I doubt many killbox players will come out and compete if any at all. If we do how will we decide what settings low grav, what maps, and whatever we decide will it just be a lost cause since no one will be able to be happy with whatever compromise we have and so once again will not play? <br>
<br>
snuffymckiller I dunno what you mean by that first sentence I have played most of the KBH maps and they are plenty big enough I have tons of time to dodge or deflect any orb unless I am busy shooting someone else. I play a little of pretty much every type of game and setting out there so I generally know how they all play out, and my clan has done a fair number of matches against killbox clans in the maps of their choice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

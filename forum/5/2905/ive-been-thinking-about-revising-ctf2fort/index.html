Who made the map?<br>
Is it better to ask that person's permission? (I think so)<br>
What exactly is the diference between the <strong class="text-strong">_b8b</strong> and the <strong class="text-strong">_b8d</strong> versions?<br>
<br>
I have already a to do list, but I'd like to know what ppl would like to see changed or improved in this map. Tell me stuff.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm, unfortunately, not skilled enough to make a whole ctf map from scrtch. At least alone. It's too complicated for me yet. I'm sure it would have plenty of bugs and malfunctions.<br>

	<div class="content">ahh yea well I guess they are the same because i only think there is three versions of that two that was mentioned and r1 version. competitive play for ctf is no existent tho I do manage to set up a scrim against a team which is allot of fun. Its best suited for public servers and provides a good environment to act as a stepping stone for new players currently ctf servers are busy but players don't like new maps for some reason just like 2fort that's why some have failed. I see US players on some European ctf servers and run-off don't you guys got these type of servers down your end.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I would make maps if I knew how to make all the events nessessary involving the flag and scores.<br>
<br>
Maybe because ctf is currently only running in pubs, ppl don't bother much trying other maps that are bigger or more complicated than 2fort. <br>
<br>
And now there's a new map called ctf_school, which is overloaded of stairways and tunnels where you can't dodge much and full of props in a middle big room, which I find to be a bad map, only because there's no movement flow almost anywhere. I hate it. But everyone seems to love it...  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
If it had ramps intead of stairs maybe I would like it... but I still don't find it aestheticly much attractive. I prefer the _terminal and one other I can't remember it's name...<br>

With so many maps around, why the hell are we all playing just 4 or 5 that I doubt that can be the best?? (rhetoric)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think I may do it anyway. <br>
<br>
And despite that ctf is hibernating in HL2DM I like to go to pubs and play it, more for sport than competition. And there's still many ppl going also.<br>
But I'd like to see the maps improved, and  if no one does it, I do it myself. Even if it takes a year to achieve what I want, and even if no one ever plays my version, I don't care.<br>

Hopefully.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
<br>
Not only the weapons placements. Here's my to do list:<br>
<br>
* Covering the roofs from both side of the balcony to prevent players that jump on top to actually see players inside.<br>
<br>
* Removing 1 RPG.<br>
<br>
* Incrising the RPG ammo respawn time.<br>
<br>
* Removing 1 SMG nade from the Mag ammo room or spliting them through both upper ammo rooms.<br>
<br>
* Placing weapons in diferent positions so that a player alone doesn't take (for example) both Mags when he has no ammo nor the gun itself, thus making other players have to wait for them to respawn.<br>
<br>
* Enlarging ammo room doors triggers so they open while you're a bit further from them. To prevent bumping on them, and for smoother gameplay.<br>
<br>
* Add some prevention against invasion of enemy ammo rooms.<br>
<br>
* Revising jump pads to see if I can make something of them (take out bugs)<br>
<br>
* Possibly changing textures (still not definite)<br>
<br>
* Changing the skybox so that you can't hit it with barrels and nades and props. (Maybe a 3D Skybox)<br>
<br>
* Adding clips to the step on the exit of the Mag ammo room (not sure) and to the bridge's side walls higher caps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, every hl2dm player should try the HL2:CTF mod. Its very similar and adds more dimension to an already great game. You wont see the 2fort map though until the new update is released, which is by far superior to the current released version.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think you are thinking of a hl2dm ctf server. They certainly had hl2:ctf servers, but there is no landmine in hl2:ctf. Sure, you can use one in a map, but its not a part of the mod or a part of any of the stock maps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

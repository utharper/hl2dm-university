I found it annoying at times that I couldnt.  Im not saying that the player should be able to get far from the edge, but some areas looked as though could walk and you were pushed off.  Maybe some more visual barrier to show that you cant walk there (a short (what would be about 2 feet high) stone wall perhaps so the visual view of the scenery isnt interrupted?).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@ Heymaker- Thanks for input. <br>
<br>
I don't really think i'm recycling anything TBH but please give examples, I want to know what you mean. <br>
the tower windows are an oversight <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> will be fixed. thanks - almost forgot about it.<br>
As for the tower. Its designed with RPG and RPG whoring in mind. i didn't want ppl to be able to get out quickly but rather use the stairs and let campkillers calculate their exit...although for game flow reasons they're still pretty fast to go up and down so i hope its a win-win. <br>
BTW, i'm not sure the ability to shoot from the tower is so great. i'm inclined to make the windows a few units higher and bigger for incoming fire but too high to shoot out from. this needs testing.<br>

from what i can tell, and again, i might be wrong, but i think opening the ability to reach the top OUTSIDE area as in para's post will kind of change the whole dynamics and flow of the map. so i think keeping the game within the maps borders will be best.<br>

<br>
If you put a barbed wire fence or something there it would give the impression that it's out of bounds, as it is it's "why not?".<br>
<br>
When I mentioned recycling ideas, it was more of impression than anything, bolstered by your abundance of curved brushwork. Not that it's a bad thing! On the contrary. This and warlock could be in the same neighborhood. Probably triggered by this game mechanic, which I remember from a screenshot of insomnia. ( where is the DL link for that? ) <br>
<br>
<a href="http://img228.imageshack.us/my.php?image=dml33thuaniab10005ij3.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/5176/dml33thuaniab10005ij3.th.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
<br>
Also reminiscent of warlock are the narrow ledges ( and by extension the wall tops ), i half expected more of them to be wider near the center of the map. In the end it doesnt matter so much, they both will stand on their own; just that there isn't anything radically different besides the tower. <br>
<br>
One tiny thing I noticed is the sprite on the charger, could be finessed a little more, why not move it to the front of the plunger part or something? Seems lonely where it is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Being able to get on top of the walls is one of my favorite features, it makes for interesting interactions, and also allows for an easy way to dodge spam like rocket, cb, and smg nades.  The flow for movement and area control is great, charger is in a great place, open areas have appropriate cover, I can only say good things.  Once that line of sight issue is worked out with some trees or another rock or something like that this map will be a superb map.

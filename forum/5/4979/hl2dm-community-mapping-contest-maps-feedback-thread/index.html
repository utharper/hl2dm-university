	<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
With respect to the proposed HL2DM Mapping Contest, I would like to request that the HL2DM Community feedback what they would like to see in new maps.  This is a great opportunity for mappers and players to interact and discuss what they want to see in new maps.<br>
<br>
You may be as specific as you like.  The topic can cover visuals, gameplay, sounds, types of maps such as competitive/league, killbox, arena and regular/pub.  <br>
<br>
You could even suggest ideas/inspiration for a map.  What is most important is that you, the community get to express your ideas and that the mappers out there hear it.  This is what will keep HL2DM going.<br>
<br>
I will periodically update this thread to include feedback from other sources.<br>

hi there i agree with most of the points<br>
balance, flow n fun .. main important things<br>
i don´t care that much about the textures<br>
(maybe a mix of custom n stock.. by thinking of the filesize)<br>
map should not be too dark all over<br>
when rpg is really needed.. make it not too easy to get<br>
<br>
think a mapping contest is generally a good thing<br>
but i have to say not the best timing to think of one when summer is near<br>
<br>
another thing i don´t understand is the discussion on hl2dm-uni forums..<br>
about Competitive/League maps, Killboxes, and Pub/Regular maps..<br>
cause in my eyes a good map is a good map.. <br>
its just a game to have fun with.. nothing more nothing less<br>
<br>
regards over n out <br>

My 2-bits: PLEASE, for the love of all that is good and holy in HL2DM - PLEASE not another Lockdown clone... The community needs variety, and not the same textures/locations over and over. Ace examples of breaking away from HL2DM design convention include: dm_milieu_final and dm_avalon. MOAR PL0X ;D <br>

I would agree I'd like to see some brighter maps, I like the outdoors tone of zeta, or caverns, or lostvillage for example. <br>

If its pub style map theres needs to be enough armor and hp, but not too much, yada yada. <br>

If you are not currently in this group then you cannot post comments. If you want to suggest something to the mappers then join the group, post your comment and then leave the group if you wish. <br>

I like maps that move fast, have bright colors, no dark maps, inside and outside is good. Not too many Rpg and Orbs. Shot guns, 357 mags, and xbows are good. Lots of corners and twists and turns so you can scare the crap out of another player. LOL Not but one supper charger, those can also be over done.

that would only increase the chances of somebody coming around the corner after you just spawned and killing you, then you would have to waste even more time bitching about how you just came out of spawn protect and they should have let you go.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When I talk about different maps, I'm saying different compared to the current competitive maps we play.  But a good competitive map can be a good pub map as well (take lockdown, cavs, lostarena, and lostvillage for instance).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, I obviously like pub maps as our [FF] clan runs three pub servers.  First off, I agree that we have not see a real high quality rat map for a very long time, a rat map with good frames. There are just so many ideas for rat maps, where do we start; Gas Station garage, the bridge of the star ship enterprise (someone Else's suggestion), inside of a car (57 chevy?), air traffic control tower, etc.<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether it is a rats map or not, all maps should be minimally decent performers. I personally like maps that play not only horizontally but also have a vertical aspect to them.  I like maps that have a certain amount of sniping spots but they should not be too difficult to defend against.  I like maps that mix equal parts of indoor areas as well as outdoor areas (Jaegar?).  I do like a certain percentage of hallway gameplay but 25% or less total within the map and the hallways need to be fairly wide.  The hallways aspect also allows for trip mine strategy which is good in small amounts.  I do not like maps that require bunny hoping or crouch jump to get to prize areas.  I like superchargers but please only one and make it easy to target.  One RPG is also OK as long as it is time consuming to obtain and is also easy to target.<br>
<br>
Weapons should be fairly easy accessible with all weapons included in the map.  I like speed ladders (Haymaker).  I like teleporters when they are used to increase the game flow from one side of the map to the other.  I like jump pads that are strategically placed to traverse vertically 2-3 levels.  I also like maps that have vantage points with long distance snipe capability, and also the ability to jump into a courtyard where there is a battle occurring.<br>
<br>
I am not partial to kill boxes.  I like and appreciate creative weapon markers and alert sounds for RPG pickup and supercharger use.<br>
<br>
So, there you have it, my preferences.  I have probably described about 3-4 different styles of maps, LOL!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">league - i'm probably one of the few that doesn't mind unbalanced maps in league play.  i've grown to appreciate the strategy/communication challenges to avalon, zeta or overwatch.  i just wouldn't want to play unbalanced maps week after week.  but for variety... its quite nice.  its a bit easier to say what i don't like in league maps.  clutter underfoot... gawd-awful bottles/cans/debris that slow a player down.  poor clipping that impedes movement or gets players stuck.  poor/dark lighting.  hidden rooms.  props that aren't really props that can be used.  boring, mundane, indistinquishable textures (amplitute) that make player map awareness difficult.  no deathtraps unless it involves high risk rpg and/or supercharger.  poor spawn points... probably THE key issue with a decent league/comp map.  the better clans will use and abuse spawn points w/o mercy.  there has to be some serious thought put into spawn points.  for example, don't put a cluster of spawns in an enclosed/semi enclosed area right next to orbs.<br>
<br>
pub - almost anything goes with me... but there are limits.  i don't mind a few hidden rooms with goodies or a death trap now and then.  i prefer only one rpg and supercharger for pubs.  i enjoy at least some vertical aspect to the map (at least like two story bldgs, ledges, rooftops, etc).  i tend to prefer lifts over jump pads... unless you come up with a different sound for your jump pad.  anything new or creative that indicates to me that the mapper spent a great deal of effort making the map.  i think of maps by Valar, Pig, Boshed, Haymaker, etc.  things as unique as Hanzo, or as simple and clean as Collapse.  yes, there's something to be said about tradition and keeping to the traditional dystopia style of map... but creating new models, textures, colors, lighting... very sexy.<br>
<br>
kb - not a big fan.  i don't think i'd know a decent kb map if one grabbed me by the balls and squeezed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

reminds me of a joke.  insert favorite nationality/state/stereotype...<br>
<br>
Polak Vasectomy <br>
<br>
After having their 10th child, a Polish couple from a small town in rural Poland decided that that was enough. So the husband went to his doctor and told him that he and his wife didn't want to have any more children.<br>
<br>
The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The doctor told the man that he was to go home, get a cherry bomb, put it in a can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.<br>
<br>
The Polak said to the doctor, "I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how putting a cherry bomb in a can next to my ear is going to help me."<br>
<br>
So the couple drove to Warsaw to get a second opinion. The doctor was just about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed they were from Gadansk. This doctor also told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, place it in a tin can, hold it next to his ear and count to 10.<br>
<br>
Figuring that both doctors couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count, "1, 2, 3, 4, 5..." at which point he paused, placed the can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand.<br>

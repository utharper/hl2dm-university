<br>
Your system specs seem slightly better than mine in regards to cpu and ram, and yet I played many hours on both maps with no crashes in listen and dedicated servers.<br>
 Is your ram over clocked? Maybe try running it at stock speed and see if that makes a difference, other than that maybe it has something to do with win 7 or system temps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Artifacts are usually caused by video card overheating or the card being overclocked.<br>
<br>
Other than that like haymaker suggested maybe your download was corrupted, I'd try a new dl of the maps for sure and since no one else is having the problem its pretty much got to be something along those lines.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yeah it looks to be an incompatibility issue between windows 7 and something in these maps. what do these 2 maps have in common that others dont? the mappers may be able to answer this question. i know its probably the beta o/s but a solution would still be nice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have not tried that yet. My pc is never really completely shutdown, but I don't see how running hot temperatures could cause the textures not too load.<br>

i tried it on multiple servers. it should work on all servers tho. can you describe the problem youre experiencing in detail and post your pc specs including the o/s youre using please? <br>

	<div class="content">for what it's worth; i'd avoid crossing system specs as such lists and method of elimination would simply be endless and for all i know, pointless.<br>
what i think should be looked at is:<br>
<br>
1) were the .bsp modified in any way AFTER cubemaps were built APART FROM PAKRATING ?<br>
renamed..?<br>
edited in any way (using text editor or bsp edit)..?<br>
<br>
2) Are there ANY OB or other games' models / materials incorporated in these .bsp's?<br>
<br>
3) Do these .bsp's use server/client commands in one way or another?<br>
<br>
4) Please try RE-COMPILING, RE-CUBEMAPPING and RE-COMPRESSING (don't use ZIP) WITH A NEW NAME and post link for those users to DL and try. (if any .res files are used i'd suggest Select All and paste into a new text file. same goes for custom Soundscapes, etc files that might be in the .bsp's.<br>
<br>
5) If that doesn't work try copying the map into a new VMF and do step 4 again. as this might be a corrupt vmf and it wouldn't be the first time.<br>
<br>
6) HOW were the files compressed and using what program? goes to both mappers and WT.<br>
<br>
<br>
All maps should run on ALL servers of ALL types. this is either map related or corrupt file related. This is not Client side related.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I used the original winrar files that were sent to me. The only thing I changed was renaming the winrar file for airfusion, since it was named something generic to avoid being downloaded before the contest ended. I did not touch pueblo at all, I simply uploaded it since it was already named correctly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not wanting to question your knowledge at all, but how could it be that we all (for the most part anyway) could download the same maps from the same place and yet only a few have a problem?<br>

 Wouldn't we all have the same problem if it were a issue in the map?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">because a corrupted file / compression can act this way = work for some but not for others. i've had this in the past more than once. so BTW can a custom model / material and / or their VMT.

renaming of compressed files is not the way to go since too many variables can go in here. i'd create a new folder and name it whatever and compress it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

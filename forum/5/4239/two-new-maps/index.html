Thanks.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised">)  Start by speedcrawl (crouch while holding run, then as yr under the ceiling, lete go of crouch).  It takes a bit to get that one.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Blender wrote:</cite>i found i over jump lots of the jumps.</div></blockquote>

Right.  It's a control thing.  I did it on purpose making the jumps overshoot from time to time as this can actually be harder than just going full force.  I think you're referring to the corner jumps in particular.  This isn't ptrain; it's getting from point A to B in bhop.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's nice to see a new jump map with something a little different and apart from the over shooting(both on bhop &amp; strafe) it plays fairly well (although a bit too easy) BUT it's just a shame it becomes unplayable when you get 3+ people in the server. Once a couple of people are in a pub server it just ends up with people blocking and spawning inside each other all the time...plus it's not so wise to give someone a stunstick as a reward especially when the player also gains access to walk over the top of the map, did you never play ultimatejumps before it was revised? level 3(?) was a nightmare with the crowbars.<br>
<br>
Also you might want to look into adding NoBlock on your server like the [IWU] jump/surf server is currently running 208.167.242.28:27015 it would certainly fix a few of the problems with the map.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":idea:" title="Idea"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's a plugin that allows players to pass through each other, as you would in other games such as TF2 (if your on the same team)<br>
<br>
I'll get back to you with a link when I find out where you can download it  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"><br>

	<div class="content">Since I've seen all (or most) of your maps I think I'm gonna say what I think about all, rather than just these 2. <br>
<br>
1st, you don't improve the maps when you mod them.<br>
I was with you and Silla in your steamlab_nub once and I kinda liked it. There was a rly good looking marble texture on one side of the map and the other side seemed kinda apocaliptical. I can't remember if I saw any flaws there, but I saw many in Jumpstyle_nub. It has a space improvement, but keeps the same spam-spawn-kill-fest as in the original, and keeps ppl getting stuck on each other in teleport_destinations (there's also a screwed teleporter in #5 that sends you right to the beggining of that same lvl again and again if you don't press the forward key at the ending). Stylejumps_nub is not an improved map aswell, imho.<br>
You should try to figure out the flaws of each map before trying to edit them. Rly.<br>
<br>
2nd, I think you could try to give some variaty to texturing. I liked these textures the 1st time I saw them, it was something diferent and there was variaty in a single map. But now I've seen like 10 maps with the same old textures... I don't want to be rude, but I think they are ugly. I think I'm in a WC all the time (and it's like I'm playing the same map all the time). This, imho, is something you should care about. <br>
<br>
3rd, since you're doing jumpmaps, you should test and retest stuff before releasing them. I'm trying many stuff for a year already and I found that many things aren't good for jumpmaps. Engine limitations are the biggest reason. Here's some of my conclusions<br>
<br>
Moving things (except <span style="text-decoration:underline">fast</span> lifts) don't rly work as one could hope. They screw your colisions with the platform and may prevent you from jumping freely.<br>
<br>
Ceilings and upper platforms are bad, unless they are more than 128 units high for stading bhop and a little less than 100 units high for crouching bhop. When you bhop crouched you go higher than 71 units (maximum hight as to force someone to crouch) and you will touch the ceiling which will inconsistently act either as a break or as a boost. This is what makes ppl get stuck on briggs platforms and on ultimatejumps 11 beams.<br>
<br>
Distances are one of the biggest challanges I've faced so far. If you make them too small it takes out the challange of tyring to jump better (for noobs) and it becomes annoying for "pros" that keep overjumping them. Try keeping a balance. It will make noobs practice more and it will most likely stay interesting in the long run. To increase dificulty, try being creative in other ways, you can look at many dm_maps for jumps, see trick jumps videos on youtube and re-create similar jumps in your maps. Remember, distances will afect the interest of your map. I, for one, never had interest in stylejumps_v2 ever since I started jumping. Even when I was noob I hated that map for not putting me up to a chalange. And btw, don't bother including any distance higher than ptrain 11 unless the person has the chance to try it over and over painstakinglessly (just like in ptrain, I mean).<br>
<br>
Space is one of the most important things in jumpmaps. Can't be too small and shouldn't be too large. Too large will make you feel sloooow even when you're going 480 speed, too small will get ppl blocking and bumping and fighting each over that. Jelly Fox knows very well what I'm talking about  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> . But I wouldn't make maps small cuz I have noblock in my server. Other ppl don't have it and they may want to play my map, so I try to make it playable without noblock.<br>
<br>
Teleporters and spawns. On this I must give thanks to the killing machine. He made a good work on ultimatejumps_r1. A trigger_push at "400 push speed", solves the problem of spam-spawn-killing-fests and crowded teleport_destinations. Plus, 3 teleport destinations is also a very good help on preventing crowded tele_destinations. With this in mind and made, you should only worry to not make ppl go into jumping ppl's way after being pushed out of the destination.<br>
<br>
Weapons... This one is... well, some ppl like it, some don't. I understand both sides. I like at least a crowbar cuz I feel better while jumping than with the ggun. But that makes ppl start killing and prevent others from training, even when they say please. The purpose of jumpmaps is (for me at least) only for training and having fun jumping. Still I will include a crowbar and a ggun in all my maps. Nothing more nothing less and not as an ending prize. Not even stunstick. Points are more than enough for me (remember the game is limited to 2000 points).<br>
<br>
Round shapes aren't good aswell, I mean horizontally like ultimate's 11. It may work and it may not. It's inconsistent. I do have some round shapes in a map of mine, but I cliped them to be square. <br>
<br>
Try to keep a balance in dificulty. I thought it up to 13 as very easy, in follow_the_nub, and then 14 is (for me) almost impossible. It just doesn't work for me. <br>
<br>
I can't remember anything else at this moment, if I do later I'll let you know. I like having new maps to play, but I still can't play any of the new maps that are around cuz they don't challange me and/or I hate the looks of them (not only your maps). <br>
<br>
Btw, I think I solved jumptrainer_nub's bug (dunno if Silla told you. If you're interested I can pm you the map in a link for testing. And btw, it would be great looking in that marble texture of yours and without the mag <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> .<br>
<br>
As a final thought, testing testing testing.... and testing... oh! and testing! is imperative imo. The reasons I haven't yet released any map is cuz I'm being cautious with all that stuff above and with the friggin damn testing. And I've been mapping some of them for almost a year now.<br>
<br>
Happy mapping. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Great input!  Much appreciated.  I know, I tend to gravitate toward certain textures at any given time; once everything was brown, then marble, and now everything's while/blue tiled.  I'm actually the worst interior decorator you'll ever come across becuz of that; details to me are non-existent.<br>
<br>
The main reason for the nubmaps is really to prevent my puter from freezing up completely so I have to shut power off manually.  Stock maps cause this nearly 100% of the time; locky loads and puter goes black.  Bio slows slows my puter down after 10 mins.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"> <br>
<br>
The remakes of jumpstyle and stylejumps was merely adding texture.  The orange/gray environment gives me a headache. So there weren't really fixes going on there.<br>
<br>
I'd luv to get that jumptrainer_nub fix!  There is a different version of it out though, where the mag has been removed.  Slapping marble on it is a great idea and make it more pleasing to the eye.<br>
<br>
Actually used the same method on update of current jumpmap (renamed academy_nubjumper_v2 to fit in Mani window) where I actually use a 1,200 speed push trigger. Stick is also gone.  Difficulty has been notched up a bit; got a pro player invasion during today's test and they flew through it.  So difficulty is bumped up.  14 creates problems for some, not others.  The update turns 14 into an even greater challenge.<br>

	<div class="content">Well, actually I think it's not needed to pm the map. All I've done was to select all the lifts and change their speed to 300, all at once (this can be done fortunatelly <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> ). <br>
<br>
300 is fast enough to not allow lift jumps, since their movement is so short and I believe it solves the bug. Try it and test it with many ppl so to make sure, cuz I only tested with myself and Silla. Can't be 100% sure it's solved.<br>
<br>
Hope it rly works as I expect.<br>
<br>
I was also trying to work on the lifts to not reset until the person jumped, having also some security system which would activate if he would stay there for like 15 seconds, it would release lethal gas, but then I kinda gave up cuz I was going the wrong way. But that may not be needed anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

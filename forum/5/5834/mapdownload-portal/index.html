	<div class="content">...just wanted to inform you guys, that we started a new mapdownload section at the bloodsuckers website after collecting maps nearly 6 years.<br>
we have around 1900 maps online, in 2-3 weeks all screened. We screened the maps with netgraph on, so you can also see, if fps balance is ok @ those maps. we used 250gts and 285gtx cards.<br>
so have a look at download section of <a href="http://www.bloodsuckers.de" class="postlink">http://www.bloodsuckers.de</a> <br>
maybe you find a map you didnt know before, as we were surprised of some cool maps around by taking screenshots.<br>
If one of the mappers is around here and dont want, that we host his map or there is an update around of his work, pls inform us. of course we could not know every mapper .)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yeah, you're right that's very important. anyways I was just saying that efps had a lot of preparation and there are very little maps on there, and then this shows up with 1000+ maps. it's just funny to me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">kinda dickish putting a watermark on all the screenshots isnt it? I understand someone went to the trouble to take a screen of each map, but I still feel that if you arent making money off those screenshots then why bother lol. For the love of the game no?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

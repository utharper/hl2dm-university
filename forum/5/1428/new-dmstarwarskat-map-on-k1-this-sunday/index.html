<blockquote class="uncited"><div>dm_ccelerator_v4.zip<br>
<br>
    The ccelerator is my weirdest map and so far the most popular. It's a huge maximum length (for the Source engine) corridor with a base at either end. Combine spawn at one end and rebels at the other. The corridor is divided into two lanes, one for each direction, and objects in the lanes get pushed at fantastic speeds down the corridor. Defend your base! There's toggle-ramps and a bridge at the midpoint, a few teleporters lining the sides, and each base has a kill-field that can be turned on for brief periods of time, freezing incoming objects temporarily and killing incoming players. Colored indicator lights on the arches over the corridor tell you whether a travelling object is a Combine player, a Rebel player, or an inanimate object. <br>
    For reasons that escape me, somebody (no idea who) took an earlier version of this map and renamed it "dm_star_wars". In this renamed form it's currently enjoying immense popularity on a server that runs only this map. Any publicity is good publicity I suppose. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">Me and Coke went there one night last week under aliases.  We were on opposite teams and just played and didnt say a word.  After playing for about 10 minutes I  was accused of having an aimbot (!!!!!!) because I got 2 fast and good xbow shots in a row.  They were pretty good shots, but not fantastic shots (wish I had been recording  a demo at the time).  The second one, the guy was coming out of the teleport, I heard him come through, turned and shot.  It wasnt hard to aim for it and get him.  My score with that frag was 10 - 10, hardly a haxer folks.  Coke is my witness to this.  All I said was not haxing thanks for the complement.  I didnt say another word and they didnt ban me.   I didnt mention the DMU, I was just curious about what would happen if a couple of us went in there.  I was betting that Coke would have been the first one to get accused but it was me if you can believe that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It wasnt a KAT member, but I dont play there normally so I dont know who the regulars are for sure.  These guys knew each other and were talking in game about the maps and the server so it sounded like they were regulars.  Being a server owner/admin myself, I respect server rules when they exist because I know what its like to have problems with people that dont respect them, so there was no problem there.  <br>
<br>
I have heard alot about those servers.  I am not one to take anyone's word about such things I wanted to see for myself if there was any truth to what I had heard.  I wasnt even leading my team, I was about in the middle.  I am not a good player compared to most folks around here which is why it was so surprising to me.   In any case I kinda took it as a complement of sorts, I dont get charged with hacking very often.  I can pwn n00bs with the best of them, but thats about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

erm i think you will find it is the KAT map that has removed the credit to singe... how do i know? I have the map and have looked at it in hammer<br>
<br>
i think you will find that the CTF version leaves the core elements of singe's map with only adding an extra addition to entertain players and to give thema  purpose in the map, and contrary to what you have heard singe's name remains in the CTF map... shame that you guys removed it in yours...<br>
<br>
also i have to ask what is this all about it is on your forum...?<br>

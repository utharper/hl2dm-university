	<div class="content">I'm making a new HL2dm map and am having an issue on the current compile. I saved up to 10 previous versions, but every one of them crash after they are compiled at random times. Ironically, the last saved version didn't crash this morning when a friend and I playtested it, although a recompile of that same version resulted in a crashing map.<br>
<br>
Checking the map for errors only results in unused keyvalues for various entities, no player start, and bad I/O connections for a suitcharger. Which are well known and non-crashing/affecting errors. <br>
<br>
There is a "1 degenerate face" message in the compile text I don't understand. Otherwise, it's a very basic map, which is partly why I'm baffled as to why its crashing. <br>
<br>

Technically it's my second post. My first account, which I only ever made one post on, didn't make it through a site update as I no longer was able to log in. Although that first post consisted entirely of a single link:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlCRfTmBSGs" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlCRfTmBSGs</a><br>
And I already made a thread elsewhere lol:<br>

<br>
Seriously though, any help is greatly appreciated. <br>
<br>
<br>
Please note also, the map is in a pre-alpha stage, there is still much to do. I'm going to be removing a set of teleports and changing some destinations, tweaking weapon layouts, making a few sections not so boring, adjusting the lighting, etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I have only hosted this on a listen server so far, running XP. I made some of the smaller brushes func_detail, but I haven't got around to optimizing yet. I also haven't applied any nodraw yet. I'll do some more optimizing. <br>
<br>
I gave the cordon tool one shot, both half of the maps crashed. It was rather late so I had to sleep. I'll go back today and do some more cutting still and keep testing. I tried to keep the map brushwork very simple, so its mainly just squares and triangles. It's all set to snap to grid. There are a total of 8 env_sprites. I removed a set of teleports on the newer save which had the total at 12 env_sprites. Otherwise there a few func_door, trigger_teleport, and a trigger_hurt. <br>
<br>
I do have a number of exceptionally long brushes, spanning the bottom and sides. I'll break those up and try to switch out some env_sprites for simple lights. I also found an erronous shaped brush I copied over from my other map dm_thumper. I'm rebuilding that.<br>
<br>
I'll post back with an update.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also, its not visible from the screens, but the middle teleport is underwater, which teleports you to a fully underwater section where you can get an RPG and 200 suit. I'm hoping the water doesn't conflict with the teleports and env_sprites. I'll have to make a deletion and compile.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm leaning towards there something being corrupt with the .vmf itself or the map not liking windows environment.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sorry I'm confused. It's a fixed version? You found an error?<br>
<br>
Tyvm for checking it out too.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I compiled, ran cubemaps on save55a. Crashed pretty quick.<br>
<br>
Maybe somethings wrong with my Hammer.<br>
<br>
I had another buddy do a compile and he said he played for over 5 minutes without a crash. <br>

	<div class="content">yep. this vmf is good now. i'm not crashing at all. <br>
i would... Varify local files of both SDK and DM<br>
then....Defrag SDK and DM<br>
then....defrag your pc<br>
see now if the map crashes. if it does - reinstall DM and Hammer<br>
 <br>
this cannot be anything but a local issue.<br>

That damn bug gets me every time, and my srcds doesn't work right so when we LAN over here it's always a listen server.<br>

Try it on a dedicated server twitch see if it doesn't happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks for the heads up.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">  Never heard of that until now. I haven't played listen servers much.<br>
<br>
But I think that probably explains it, because I was noticing the crashing was happening at places all over the map. Come to think of it, it would usually crash as I would turn and jump and probably changing weapons.<br>
<br>

Haven't had a chance to get it up on a dedicated server yet. Although I have had about 5 other people do compiles without any problems occuring.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Well, I did some testing. Everytime I would jump and change weapons I would crash. Glad to know its not the map either. Thanks again for the heads up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Almost every map has an rpg, which makes it a control/whore rpg ftw map (not all of them, like ld_r3)<br>
The few ones that don't have rpg are really interesting, cuz it's good to play around another strategy from time to time, like controlling other weapons, etc,etc.<br>
Don't really like this idea at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Anyway, backbone_rpg is not in the maplist at CU anyway.<br>

that's the RPG version that was released for CU play, the majority of the servers are running the original version of lostarena which doesn't have a rpg</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">oh ok, just saw this thread now. seems that I made some confusion with all those lostarena versions - I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
1. there was the original version of lostarena which has been send in to the hl2dm mapcontest so I think it is the one which is most spreaded in the internet<br>
2. db|nix from clansunited asked me to put in a rpg, because they need one in all league maps, dunno why. so I did, this version is fully compatible with the "old" version. changes where made via "EntEd".<br>
3. there was this thread about elevators in lostarena. I took the lostarena version with rpg and improved them a bit, maybe some of you'll remember.<br>
<br>
so all versions are compatible to eachother, that means it does NOT matter which version of lostarena you have in your local mapfolder. It's only relevant for the server!<br>
<br>
hope everything is clear now <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It is however relevant cause people who think they got lost arena X may have Y and for CAL matches not having the RPG or even knowing it existed and playing a clan who knew about it could cause major disputes, then you play the next match and it doesn't even exist on that server. If you make any changes to a map it should be given a new name so players can quickly see the map is different and then either know what is different or ask what is different. Now I wont know going into any given server which version I am playing. And people downloading it won't even know which version they are getting if they are not knowledgeable on the subject. Being a cal admin I would have hoped to know this but it is all brand new to me as of this thread.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well it was never intended to be like this.<br>
for public gaming you will have 99% of servers running lostarena without rpg. maybe I should rename the version for Clansunited, you are right, something like dm_lostarena_cu. I thought this version will only be used @ cu and everyone there knows to get the right version before playing.<br>
<br>
so honestly there are only two different versions of lostarena. the version with improved elevators does not really change any gameplay.<br>
I just hate it to have three versions (*_r1, *_r2, v2 and all that crap) of a map if it is not really necessary. I personally don't like having more than one version of map in my mapfolder.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

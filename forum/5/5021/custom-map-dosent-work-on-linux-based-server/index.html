Remove all the ladder props and ladder entries from your map and then test on linux servers again.<br>
If that don't work I guess you could keep removing other entries till you find the bug and map runs fine on linux.<br>

If you got any displacements remove them and load the map on linux.<br>

Talking of case characters never type this "" in anything you have in a map e.g. a model name <br>
it kills and corrupts the map big time lol. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hmmm... you got lots of stuff going on outside the map, in the void. Triggers and infotargets, in short, entities are outside the map. This is not good.<br>
I prefer to wait for other ppls opinions about it, since I'm not the best person to give advice, but I find it hard to belive that you compiled the map without leaks. And this may be your problem here.<br>
<br>
I also got this in from VBSP in the log:<br>

<br>
please provide the server console messages<br>
<br>
do not use the LOG files or remote UDP logs, they are not flushed and complete after the crash<br>
<br>
you need direct access to the running console. then you can figure out where he crash. If he crash on "Got edict" you just have too much entities in it, verify the vbsp output where he display all entities and brushes count you use<br>
<br>
if you have much much much luck the server will report a ASSET message where you can see where the problem is. in the most of these cases he display immediate you should report the bugs to /dev/<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ff1eaf3f3dfe9fef3e9fab1fcf0f2"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="137d667f7f5365727f65763d707c7e">[email protected]</span></a> or something. Verify the last lines and start the server with a none crashing map and verify it again, to find out where he crash. Than it could be much easier<br>
<br>
my last crash i use google and copy paste the error message in it - i got 2 hits - both say "too much entities" - than i google what stuff count as an entity ... then i just group all func_details together and voila working - this was easy ... and lucky ...<br>
<br>
edit: if you not able to get the server console direct way - provide the crashing BSP - i try it than</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">in normal it should come "Got edict" ... but it is crashed before he could get all entities. This is shit, because if he crashed after Got Edict i could you better say where you have to look ... now you have to figure out ...<br>
<br>
Please check your spawn entities. If you only provide combine and rebels, but the server runs in deathmatch mode you get sometimes very wired errors. And crashes too. Sometimes you spawn into spectator and could not join the game, sometimes the server just crash. This is map depend, but always same result<br>
<br>
Try to run the map in team deathmatch and in deathmatch mode (mp_teamplay) and verify the output again, then start the server - if it still crashing - more than one time and verify output. Goal is to see if he still crash at this point<br>
<br>
If the server crash on randomly points, then a dynamic entity you made is corrupt. This can be timers or triggers<br>
<br>
If the server crash anytime on that point, go into hammer, select ALL entities you have and move these into a new vis-group and disable the vis group. Create one deathmatch player, compile it with fast settings with vvis -fast and without vrad. Than test it - than the map should be fine<br>
<br>
After this remove your added spawn and move all spawns from the disabled vis group back to the map. Compile it with vvis fast and vrad and test it again<br>
<br>
If this fine repeat these steps with all prop_statics and than all other props. Last step should be activate all other entities you have back. Dynamics and stuff<br>
<br>
If you activate all back and it is still running, then you can thing "wtf" - lol - than you have a VVIS or VRAD problem. But this is very rare that vvis or vrad crash a server. In most case it still crash the client<br>
<br>
If you follow these steps you can easy find out what kind of element makes you unhappy<br>
<br>
BTW: If you map crash at the beginning where you anything deactivated, go into auto-vis groups and deactivate func_details, maybe there is a detail in the map that is uncool, but most time this just crash the client and not the server<br>
<br>
Remember to monitor each step you do, than you can find the ugly element and report here your results. So other mappers they have maps they crash could figure out why and faster solve this problem</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've tried change teamplay to 1 and it dose exactly same thing( crashes).<br>
the map we are talkin about has lots of trigers, teleports etc. but i've also tried other verions of redtower (older) and first redtower map, wich as far as i remeber has no teleports etc crash too.Any way redtower wasnt just upgrade to older version.. everything was built from begin ( i think  lol) so i think i can be anything...or everything lool</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So this map is on the slate for revision this season.<br>
2 Issues I know of are the game player equip needs to be removed and the smg grenade near the rocket stops spawning and maybe should just be moved out of there. <br>
<br>
There has been talk of adding a super charger at the top of the map. <br>

	<div class="content">Yes move the smg nade and the orb in rocket area to some other place in the map where they would be more effective.  200 suit charger at top might be an interesting juxtaposition to rpg.<br>
<br>
I would also move at least one of the spawns (if not both) out of the rpg area, the one on the level near the 2 healthpacks and 2 suit pickups, is nothing but a spawnkill fest.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

frenzy was another one he made it was also a hl1 map it is not his map original map either.<br>
octagon was q3dm6 which had already been made for hl as pg_campgrouds once again not his original map. <br>

</div></blockquote>

The original motivation for placing double melees from my recollection was the old bug where the crowbar would hit slower on linux servers. This could create uneven rounds since if you switched to the other teams linux server for your rebel round you would end up with a slower melee weapon than the other team that just played rebel on your windows server. I think many of the spectator bugs and crashes started happening when this bug was patched since I don't recall crashing much or seeing ghost melee weapons from spectators in double melee maps prior to that.<br>
<br>
The vis bug, while an issue, is as you stated still fair since both teams must endure it as part of playing combine. The crashes far outweigh the benefits.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah and Sadist, it sure does cause crashes. I have literally tried to run matches on double melee maps and had every single player crash at least once trying to start the map multiple times, switch to another double melee and it happens again. Switch to regular equip and not a single crash. I have also seen much more in game crashes in those maps during nightly scrims. It's anecdotal evidence, but I have seen so much it is pretty overwhelming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

many of Source ents are broken in DM. player_equip is one of them. sometimes it would not work, not work properly, crash the server, crash the client, produce all sorts of weirdness etc.<br>
damn shame innit. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"> <br>
i will note though, since my early days of mapping i've grown fond of using an OnMapSpawn triggered player_equip to give all players a set of weapons in most of my killboxes. this NEVER EVER crashed or produced ANY issues.<br>
Since an essential part of competitive play is picking up weapons / items an OnMapSpawn doesn't make much sense and the mapper will need to rely on trigger volumes triggering the equip in locations in the map = which is actually the only aspect of this ent that is broken. I personally think, and again, that is personal opinion, this has direct connection with players rates and in general, their connection quality to the server at a given time (as we know, this has to do with a multitude of factors). as mappers who delve into Source IO in DM see again and again how IOs that are dealing with anything that has to do with rates / hitreg will be most likely broken / not function well / randomly act up.<br>
<br>
so sad. and for that and honestly for that alone i would be one mad happy bastard to see DM port to OB.<br>

Why (out of of pure curiousity with no agenda on my part) would you want to get rid of the sawblades?  Would you replace them with a different object that achieves the same result i.e. radiator?  Or just to get rid of them to reduce the number of grav objects?  <br>
<br>
I would think the dm community, in trying to promote the grav gun as one of the unique features of hl2dm, would want more grav objects in maps... but i digress, i am just curious why you wants less sawblades in this particular map where i think they offset the xbow,mag, and shotty very well in the corridors...<br>

	<div class="content">Saws in maps with alot narrow / twisty corridors (which are plentiful on amp) tend to be somewhat overpowered, in that you can carry them around silently and get an instant free kill if you happen to meet someone around a blind corner. Anything else (mag hs aside, which obviously takes much more skill to land in a sudden encounter than a prop) has less than lethal damage, causes self damage at close range or has warmup time, and other props generally arent worth carrying around as they obscure vision, arent guaranteed to kill in 1 shot, may not fly well and are much easier to catch.<br>
<br>
I dont recall offhand exactly how many saws the map contains, but i think itd be fairly safe to cut the number in half. Those removed can always be replaced with different props, maybe a couple of those large blue barrels that generally do lethal damage and make good hitscan shields.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>The Argumentalizer wrote:</cite>Why would you put a charger up top and signal to the strong area someone is using it?!?!?</div></blockquote>

Indicator lights arent there to show when the charger is being used, but to display its state of charge (full, half, empty). Of course if you see it drop from green to yellow, you know its being patronized, and have to decide whether or not its worth rushing before they get a full charge, at risk of a waiting ambush. Also, due to the visleaf layout on amp, players with good sound would be able to hear the charger being used from all areas of the map anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I am serious too....DONT DO IT.  Worst thing ever to put in a map just like toxic puddles.  Why should a player be punished for using a corridor or path that was put in the map.  You will ruin the flow and it will just make it retarded and people will hate it.  People use the RPG alot, maybe we should take health points away from them every time they shoot it.  If you dont want people to use it, it should not be in the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

One of the main changes of r1 was to remove slams, and i cant imagine many of us want to see those return.

Thats the idea behind a supercharger up top, players will have reason to roam the entire map and move between the control points (or be forced to use everything inbetween the control points in a 2v2 if they manage to lose them both), instead of just clusterfucking around the rpg area for 90% of the match and leaving vast chunks of the map relatively untouched.<br>

<br>
Move the smg nade near rocket a little up the stairs. (fix spawning) encourages rocket controllers to move out of their comfort zone to get it a little. <br>
Move the AR2 into the large courtyard in the bottom on a flat surface. Encourages rocket controllers to venture out where they are weak from above and attackers to venture down to get it. <br>
Maybe a super charger is over kill and I think that it is nice to have some variety on maps if amp does not have one thats not bad. So what about 1 or 2 30 HEV chargers on the top.

	<div class="content">Didnt realize there were only 2 saws total. I guess having a couple of 50-3 type pub rounds there using the same saw the whole time gave a warped impression. Anyway, 2 saws is obviously fine.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt go up top for a pair of 30 chargers either, way too slow and noisy for the reward. 4x suit, maybe, but its still minimal reason to leave an area with similar armor, more life, rocket, orb, smgnade and a camp spot that can watch every available entrance.<br>
<br>
Supercharger up top fixes two problems- 1, the rocket almost always being a one shot kill when used on a visible opponent, and 2, the majority of a rather large maps gameplay revolving around 1 cramped room. Move the ar while were at it and everyones suddenly got great reason to actually travel around the whole map, or make a choice between which area to control, or how far to split up the team to control all the best areas. The gameplay can only get better and more diverse in the end.<br>
<br>
And lastly, no dm_octagon style gimmicks (toggled lasers, random healing zones, orb chutes, mobile stairs that occasionally trap or kill players, etc, etc). If an odd feature doesnt directly add strong gameplay value (rpg door / spam door triggers on bio, secret room trigger on tigcrik, etc) then it has no place in a league map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Like removing all HP and armour pickups from that area?<br>
<br>
<br>
20 min match = can get RPG 10 times which is 30 shots not counting the ammo lying around.<br>
2mins is just and example but I think 1 min is too short.  The wapons already respawn every 30 seconds.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Since people do like to camp the rocket, it might be best to move the health and suit pickups from there to give them more reason to leave.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i think this will totally break the game flow. making the layout and situation for the RPG harder i think will work better than having ppl literally wait for 1 or 2 minutes on a DM map for a weapon. even as powerful. the idea is absolutely spot on and i couldn't agree more but i think this should be achieved in a different manner.<br>

	<div class="content">Actually weapons respawn every 20 seconds, not 30. Items and ammo respawn every 30 seconds. I never really did understand why valve did this but it certainly makes it so aside from orbs and smg grenades most people do not bother memorizing or controling ammo. Many times I think the weapon respawn should be reduced to 30 like ammo. But that is another discussion outside of this map. <br>
<br>
Also I am think if you make alot of small changes they will really add up. Without the need to completely change the game play. smg, and orb moved away from the rocket as well as a couple spawns and maybe we should move the health and armor at rocket floor 1 up to rocket floor 2. And you put supplies just a little out of reach where they have to go get them and just in reach where attackers can grab them. That creates good conflict and forced interaction. People meet and fight over resources.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

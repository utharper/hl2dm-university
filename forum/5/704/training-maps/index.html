<br>
I am interested in a list of maps that people have used for training in movement or specific weapons training.  Can anyone else think of any maps that are not listed,  <br>
<br>
Of course many of us use Lockdown for the LD jump<br>
<br>
I have also started using Caverns_r1 for jumping practice (lots of great jumps in there) and also the large flat areas are good for bhop practice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">In addition to Lockdown, I like Lost Village for the jump onto the balcony.  Killbox KBH (the one in Maeggs demo) is good for learning lifts and air movement.  There's a Pulsebox I've used that has a large square room with many weapons spawning in the middle and 4 exploding barrels.  It's pretty good for nade cooking... also good for shooting/catching orbs and switching to a mag or bow to shoot the barrels between orb catches.  I'll have to look to see which Pulsebox version.<br>
<br>
edit:  not a Pulsebox after all, but Killbox3</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">there was these maps i used to play in cs i can't remember the names.<br>
aim_colt or someshit?<br>
what my idea for a hl2dm version would be a level playing field with long range room for peeking around corners on large blocks. distance too long for grav nade, but perfect for mag/xbow practice. <br>
<br>
another map that was fun as hell to play was one where two teams played, so one team spawned in a skeet shoot and as soon as the round began they shot into the air, the oppsing team had awp and would try to shoot them out of the sky. this was too much fun. anyone remember this map or know what it's called? i'd load up  cs.1.6 just to play it again. haaha.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah No.7 its was aim AK47/Colt or something like that.  That would be fun in dm I use to love that map.  Best map for working on your long range headshots in cs 1.6.<br>
<br>
Maps I've used for movement training in hl2dm are, LD_r3 for its various jumps to and from the charger room, Lostvillage for bhop and a couple good jumps, Lost Arena has some good jumps and is nice for bhopping,  and dm_domebox for air control, nade cooking, xbow aim while in the air, I also use dm_donutbox to practice my air control and lift skills using the 4 lifts in the center.  Its a lot of fun bouncing from lift to lift, then to every other lift around the circle ect..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

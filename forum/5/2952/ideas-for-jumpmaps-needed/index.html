	<div class="content">I'm working on jump maps for as long as I know how to handle Hammner. I studied some jumps and how they work, the various types of skills and jumps you can make and all that stuff.<br>
<br>
But all the maps that I know are simple corridors with platforms in them. I had lots of fun in them, nonetheless, but I'd like to achieve something more, or rather diferent. So I started making this map with a certain theme, to try to make it look just like a regular dm map or, at least, like if you are in an actual world. It's a tomb-like map that's too raw yet, but it's going.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I need more ideas. Both for the map theme and the jump types.<br>
I made a <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?njnzlljodl0" class="postlink"><span style="color:#0000FF">video</span></a>, kinda in a hurry, just to show you some of the jump types I prototyped. I forgot to include a bhop thing like in Stylejumps first part with the beams, and some air control training jumps.<br>
<br>
So the question is:<br>
<br>
How would you like a jump map to be, and with what types of jumps?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nice vid, a theme map would be cool<br>
<br>
for a bhop section have a look at the format they use in CS:S, they have blocks that you can only bhop on, if you land on them they start to sink and then you get teleported back to the beginning.<br>
<br>
Air control like the upper walls of lostvillage would be cool to see in a map as that took me a while to master.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

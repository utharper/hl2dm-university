Maybe delete the small props, like the cinder blocks, and that useless gas container that takes hardly any damage.<br>

A bit more light needed in the area shown in these screenshots.</div>

@kon:<br>
its impossible to shoot the player in the lighted tower, but you can easily shoot him when he comes back in the map.<br>
i have a sound when i push the button, and i didnt use any custom sound, so thats strange. can somebody confirm that?<br>

<br>
Just copy paste compile log in the the txt box, press Check Log and BAM. Most of the time they have good information to help you troubleshoot problems in your map. <br>
<br>
As far as the point file, I think it's Map &gt; Load Pointfile. <br>
If there's a leak, there should be a Yes/No dialog that asks if you want to open the file. <br>
Click Yes.<br>
Look for the little red line that appears in your map. It should lead you to teh leak.<br>

so you mean you don't know who Sacrifist is.<br>
<br>
@ Maxtasy - you seem to have skills and an interesting view. it would be more interesting seeing an original level rather than a redo. not taking anything away from this work.<br>

the look of feudal was one of the reasons i wanted to remake it. first i tried to decompile the original version which was impossible, so i recreated the layout out of my mind and mixed it up with some ideas by my side.<br>
<br>
so the last beta version is finished now. <br>

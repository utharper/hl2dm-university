Anyone get to play this yet?  I could even connect to their login Server for EA account - let alone a server browser.<br>
Apparently the servers were running fine until this morning though - game unlocked @ 12:00 am</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I feel this game is terrible.  At least for the 2maps u get to play.  You can barely see the enemy until your right on top of them.<br>
So much visual shit going on = extremely distracting - although video options can remedy that im sure.<br>
<br>
But yea... it's basically one giant camp fest.  Regardless of the game mode.  MW2 is hardly a good game, but I would buy it 2x's over rather then this one.<br>
<br>
I managed to call in a couple mortor strikes, but they only deliver to a tiny tiny area, and you need to sight it in with your tech goggles first, which typically means death.  For me anyways.<br>
<br>
Not a huge fan of this, but I would love to see some other game modes as well.  Relying on your team to push for an objective is frustrating at best.  <br>
<br>
Thoughts anyone?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Looks like the engine still classes the mouse wheel as an axis making it impossible to bind it to anything other than prev/next weapon Numpties for that reason I wont be buying it I havent even played it yet only tried settign up my controls and failed because of this bug/flaw.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I didnt play the first Beta.  I played this one for about 2 hours and so far I am not impressed at all.  I dont think the game is worth $60.  <br>
<br>
The maps are tiny and the one map (mountains map) I never got to see anything but the first section because it turned into a sniper fest and neither team could get out of the first base.  The tunnels map wasnt too bad its just really too tiny for 24 people and it turned into more of a deathmatch game than a control point game.<br>
<br>
Other than that, the movement is a bit rough and unresponsive imo.  The sights on the guns mostly block your view than anything else.  Just wasnt that impressed with what I guess should be a pretty much "finished game".  It is supposidly going to be in stores on Oct 12.<br>
<br>
I definately dont think its better than BFBC2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You can't fully turn off AA so my computer couldn't really handle it on the lowest settings. <br>
It was frustrating not being able to leave a game at the end, you have to wait for the next match to load and start before you can get to the main menu.<br>
Overall it felt unpolished compared to MW2. meh</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not surprising its just a bad reinvention of a old good game, albeit one that was riddled with hackers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Fucking wow I haven't heard sounds for guns like this since like, fuck, when I shot a real gun!  You can actually feel like your fucking gun is THERE.  WOW is all I can really say about that shit.  And maybe none of you have played the game with speakers and a good subwoofer IDK, but comparatively even on 5.1 speakers this game's sounds are amazing compared to all others.<br>
<br>
As for the gameplay itself it looked pretty much like the herp de derp shit that comes out today.  I would play this game over MW2 just for the gunsounds though holy shit.<br>

	<div class="content">Mousewheel once again unbindable to anything but prev/next weapon.<br>
Mouse sensitviy feels weird when using iron sights.<br>
Weapons are too powerful enemies die too quick I would rather have a litle longer gun fight which reward the player with consistant aim not one that gets 2 lucky bullets registered.<br>
Still the same rather boring and linear gameplay of the Beta which due to the low HP or high damage of weapons makes camping easier and the best way  rack up loads of kills I tried ramboing but soon realised it doesnt work and when I started camping with the sniper rifle the kill count started to rise <br>
There is no team balance so often found one team had double the players.<br>
Cannot type when dead or quti the game until next map loads up.<br>
Can adjust FOV but its not an option in the menu - Stupid if you ask me.<br>
Why do all FPS have RADAR these days? They made an excellent sound system but then put a fucking RADAR in the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

not true.  all you have to do is click in the mouse column(middle column) of the action you want to bind and scroll up or down. it displays as ms axis 2 or something like that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It doesnt work.  Bind 1 thing to mouse up then bind another to mouse down its says its in use and asks "do you want to overwrite?"<br>

	<div class="content">ok, ill agree with that, but your post stated it wasnt possible to bind the mouse wheel to anything other then prev/next weapon. all i was saying is you can bind mouse wheel up or down to another action.  you're correct in saying up and down should be bindable to 2 seperate actions tho.  i would think that will be patched shortly after game is released.   thats not make or break for me tho.  you dont have a slew of weapons that need to be binded like in hl2dm.  sound is great, graphics are sick, runs smooth as silk.  i think this is a terrific game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 I think its just how the engine works <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">  like an axis on a joypad, binding one of those in a game usually binds the oposite without you having to do anything, e.g just bind up and left.<br>
I just dont like it when I cannot have the controls I want its why I stopped playing FPS on consoles.<br>
<br>
Does this game use hitscan or the same projectile system bad company uses?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've played it for a few hours and I noticed the game wasn't too responsive for me with settings pushed to the max but when I lowered my res 1280x720 but kept settings to max I started owning everyone lol...I thought it might've been the netcode or something because I would see people and shoot them first but die first...game becomes really responsive and felt like Modern Warfare 2 with upgraded graphics...it was fun<br>
<br>
The game uses 2 different engines: Single player uses a modified Modern Warfare 2 engine while the Multiplayer uses Bad Company 2 engine...they might have more game modes with vehicles I guess since they opted for BC2...hopefully</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

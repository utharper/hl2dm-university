	<div class="content">see pomp, the point that you are really missing here is not that ill will isnt good, or maybe he passed a hacking test(which is still in question), the reason why ppl are losing respect for you and V is because you put ppl on your roster that are aliasing. its lame beyond lame.  any team can load there roster with aliases and disguise who is on there team, but there is a certain unwriten rule that when you play in a league such as CAL or warzone that you at least have the dignity to state exactly who it is you have rostered. nobody cares who you recruit for your team, good for you and odog that you have worked hard to build that team.  the thing that is killing your rep is that you have admitted that ill will is an alias.  the irony is you want to be a CAL admin and help grow the community but at the same time you are doing something that is not right, its not technically against the rules to have aliases on your team but its fucking lame as shit.  here is a quote for you on the Kb league<br>
<br>
"Yes, Fearsome a lot of talk is going on doesn't mean this is part of the plan, please consider this everyone is getting a say who is truly interested to play the league yet it doesn't mean that every idea is even being considered. <strong class="text-strong">My main concert ATM is the amount of leets trying to get in and make it theirs, which I really like to discourage</strong>."<br>
<br>
oh really?  how about if everybody just makes teams full of "leets" aliased as others?   by your own statements thats cool with you.  when i signed up to be an admin for warzone, it was to help out dallas with a league of honest player looking to have a good time.  Dallas has gone out of his way to make the league, run the site, put his own money up for the new site/forum, all the while he asked you straight to your face (as did i) who Ill will is, and you wouldn't tell him or me.  word is around, so you can see, that everybody has heard about this, and it makes your CAL/warzone team look bad, really bad.  many teams put players on their roster that were not in their clan, or built a team of players from other clans just for CAL, but atleast they had the dignity and honesty to tell everybody who their players actually are.  thats fine if you wanna keep your little secret, its just making you look bad.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Team Veracity was doing great, this season of Wazone we wanted to have fun, we didn't care about winning, we were just a bunch of players hanging out, practicing, having fun and that's what attracted Ill Will to us, he was never recruited.<br>

<br>
you're just not getting it are you?  i dont know why you arent understanding this.   yes EC loaded their roster, but they are NOT aliases, do you see the difference?  again, nobody cares who you put on your roster, all we are saying is that you put ppl on your roster that are who they say they are.  let me put it to you this way.  here is the EE roster for the warzone<br>
<br>
chemicalburn - nutrigrain - rico - cerberus - bot - joeynova -  josey wales - that_guy - 2snails - poor_billy - Fresca - chard - ....that is our real roster.  <br>
<br>
now what i could have done is this<br>
<br>
chemicalburn -<strong class="text-strong">Ill Bob </strong>- <strong class="text-strong">Ill Dan </strong>- cerberus - bot - joeynova -  josey wales - that_guy - 2snails - <strong class="text-strong">Ill Steve</strong> - Fresca - chard - alliased our best players and told ppl i cant tell you who they are. sorry.  <br>
<br>
do you see the difference here?  technically, yes i could have done that in warzone since there is no rule against it, so could have every team.  nobody does because its just not something that is excepted.  a lot of these games are won and lost by knowing your opponents, knowing who you are playing.  i guess this is falling on deaf ears tho.  <br>
<br>
dont get all defensive about your KB division, nobody is saying they dont want you to lead it up.  i think you would be a good person to get that going, you're oganized and well motivated, you built MF from the ground up,  i just think ppl are questioning your integrity right now. thats all.  AND whether Ill Will came to you or you recruited him is a mute point.  you are the co-leader of Veracity and with that comes a responsibility of running that team, and part of that is being honest to your fellow team leaders and league admins about who you are rostering, im sure you knew this is something that was not going to fly from day one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok.. Think what you want, but I've been Ill Will for a while now. The main reason I used the account in the first place was to escape all the drama that was going on at the time and just play hl2. When I did this, I found a group of people who also just wanted to play and get better, but not be associated with any drama. So I decided to help them. I am not usually one to alias, as many of you know, but I will make an exception if I feel it could help someone or a group of people. So was it illegal doing what I did? no. Was it against what most people would have done? yes. I made a judgment call, and I think that it was more important to get a new team active, involved, and improving rather than to bring a spotlight of negative attention to them. So if you disrespect anyone after this whole ordeal, it should be me for not revealing my name, not Team V. In any case,  my goal wasn't to trick people and enter a league just to anonymously beat everyone up, but rather to help decent people with potential who otherwise might not have been given a shot.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, they might actually be competitive against 911 and its roster and PB playing for EE...<br>
I disagree with the aliasing generally, but its sorta funny and many playing with Luke and getting some of that inner clan/semi-pro stuff likely helps Team V get better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If there is a lesson here it is that when you play in a league you always put your best team out and you don't underestimate any teams, because you never know who might be playing for them. The only reason I can see why any of you would be legitimately mad about this is if you put your B team in to play against Team V and they lost because Luke was playing. Even then its still your own fault for not putting your best team in the match, or just not being as good as team V's current players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dont think any of us in the warzone, certainly not me, would have had any issue what so ever with luke playing with V under his real name.  you can help a team with your real name, i think playing with them under an alias caused more of a negative result as far as V's reputation, but it sure made everybody aware of their existance, thats for sure.  I can understand why Luke would do this, i guess, but i think in reality this was going to be leaked at one point or another.  i do know that luke is somebody who is always willing to help, he has helped me out with a few things, so if he says he did it for that reason then i believe him, but like i said i think he could have done it under his real name, i know none of the warzone admins would have cared.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, i kind of understand Luke, everyone has been on his back almost the whole cal season, so I understand that he just wanted to play the game without any bs. But I also agree with the people that are "mad" at him or team V because there was an "unknown" player on their roster that was obviously aliasing, all team V knew who he was but wouldn't tell anyone, that was kinda lame, in my opinion this whole thing that team V just didn't want to create drama is just going to go right against them, and create a lot more drama than if they would've said who he was from the start, even if he keeps Ill Will as a name, at least let others know who he really is. But finally, I don't blame Luke at all for doing this, because I have endured pretty much the same thing as he did in the past, and I seriously thought about just quitting the game, or doing another account and just join a different team, not getting involved in any of the drama, just playing my matches, but I just decided to change name and just don't get involved in anything, so overall I don't blame Luke one bit for anything, I mostly blame all of the guys that were on his ass the whole season.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The whole thing is stupid.  Yea aliasing is taboo.  We all view people that do it constantly with some suspicion.  I have deep sixed a previous account because of drama in this game and started again with a new name and account.  I will admit I do alias in pubs on occasion once in a while because sometimes I just dont want to be fucking bothered by anyone and I just want to play.  The aforementioned drama is so fucking stupid its beyond belief.  Get off it already.  Do we really want to drive another good player and good person out of this game?  Would that make anyone feel better?<br>
<br>
I understand why Luke did what he did, sometimes you just dont want to deal with the BS.  He has never done it before so get off his and Team V's back already.  Its not like he was playing for Team V as Ill Will and $W as Luke.  He probably asked that it not be revealed and I cant blame him although it backfired and Im sure he might regret his "judgement call" right about now.  In any case, Team V is damn lucky to have him mentoring them.  I wish I had been playing for with so I could have learned a few things too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's stupid, you can say anything you want.  Unless of course luke threatened you with your life if you talked.  But I doubt it.<br>

If you seriously think anyone is bullying here you need to get a hold of yourself.  I mean really.  Everyone here is stating facts and simply telling the truth, and having an obvious/natural reaction to what happened.  If anything, I think the people here are being NICER to you than I'd expect.  I don't know why you don't understand that.  You were wrong and acted childish(to put it nicely) when avoiding everyone's questions in the beginning of this thread.  I mean look, if you think this is bullying....good luck surviving in the real world...people are a lot less sympathetic when you make mistakes when they actually matter and are not related to a game we all play on the internet.<br>
<br>
And let's not lose sight of that people....a GAME we all play on the internet.<br>
<br>
It's just a game...which makes my above post rather irrelevant.  But reading it my immediate reaction was to get it off my chest.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day pomp, luke, hl2dmu, everyone else. (not sarcasm, i really mean have a nice day)  <br>

im pretty much a joke among the leets<br>
<br>
if i cried and blocked and made a bunch of drama about every shot i took about being a newb , even by people you look up to in the community, i would prob have uninstalled this game by now because there would be no 1 to play with, but instead i just try to get better<br>
<br>
just do what your mommy told you to do when u were a lil kid and just ignore them... its pretty simple</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's too bad all that had to happen in the first place and he became exploited or this wouldn't even be happening right now, it's also his right to play for whatever team he feels like.<br>
<br>
 On another note its also a sign of how small this community really is when ip addresses are known and can be used to identify someone who is trying not to be identified. Next time someone wants to be unknown they are going to have to ask their ISP for a new address first.<br>
<br>
If there is a lesson here it is that when you play in a league you always put your best team out and you don't underestimate any teams, because you never know who might be playing for them. The only reason I can see why any of you would be legitimately mad about this is if you put your B team in to play against Team V and they lost because Luke was playing. Even then its still your own fault for not putting your best team in the match, or just not being as good as team V's current players.</div></blockquote>

Did you see the the date IHOP was made? And NO I am not flattering myself, but I have the feeling that it will never matter with someone like you, I almost did not come back from my x country trip, I had already switched everyone over to another acct NOT the acct that holds all my games and my secret acct has NO friends and NO groups. I only came back to the U for the killbox league, same with IRC, I only deal with certain people IF I have to; AND not all that follow are nice BTW, right now there are 2 people in IHOP who are there just to hassle me, one already done it, I have NO IDEA who this guy is nor what his beef with me is. I have some Euro writing shit about me on the Skulshock Forums, what is up with that? I have a hate group and the guy that's started it leaves me a message in the servers I frequent everyday "say Hello to POMP from the laughing man" yeah that's FUN, not creepy at all. People telling you everyday they wish you would die. I can't stay in a server for more than 1 map, then I jump because towards the end of the map I will start people coming in just to hassle me, would you like to take over being POMP? because at this point I do not wish this kind of weird fame on ANYONE.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">All Team V did not know who he was  and i never pushed it, being such a small thing. If a team fields anyone and that makes them more competitive, what the fuck difference does it make?<br>
<br>
Team V is NOT a clan and Team V does not have 10 upper level players like some out there (hmmmmm?).<br>
In fact, Team V is about just this sort of situation.<br>
Maybe some didn't bother to check out the mission of TeamV.<br>
To field a team from those who are not in a clan or a clan that cannot field a team consistently, or singles that want to play.<br>
So you didn't KNOW it was Luke, so what?<br>
Would you have played better or won if you knew?<br>
<br>
Still, to lambast a team that isn't even in first place...  wtf.<br>

	<div class="content">ok well, seriously this is getting way farther than it should go, I never had a problem with you pomp, but now seriously I think that your taking this whole thing (not only about this subject) but the whole gaming thing WAY too personally, this is an internet game meant to play and have fun with some internet friends. Your taking this like it's real life, it's not... If you want people to stop "harrassing" you, you should really stop taking every single thing people say so personnaly and just ignore them and play the game or else you'll just make your life fucking miserable because of an internet game, and that's something that would just be incredibly ridiculous to let happen. So, saying this as a friend, you should really stop taking this game so seriously and take it as a game like it really is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

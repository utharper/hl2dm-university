Sub Zero had the same problem with his port initially.  I think he fixed it in his version though.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the bugs, kids.  Valve won't bother to fix anything for at least 6 months.  All the TF2 and CSS bugs they just created are going to have to be fixed first.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Here you go better worded explanation on the sprint delay I'm using it in the console command bug which I believe all of us should do to send steam a message there as well<br>

Other then that theres defintiyl some shit that needs to be sorted out. <br>
Stopping and starting another bhop is slow.<br>
Physics bugs are worse now, for ex. dying b4 it actually hits u on ur screen or b4 they even shoot the object at u, and speedballs are much worse they are nowhere near where they appear on screen.<br>
Hitreg is better but still iffy at times and especially on certain players, also physics seems to bounce off certain players more then others, and alot.<br>

	<div class="content">I was talking to people and this hasn't just affected people who play the game for kills/pubbing. The <span style="text-decoration:underline">scripting</span> community has got a big slash in the throat as the most used command "wait" has been removed. My brother has made hundreds of scripts over 2 years and he can't use any-to hardly any of his scripts because it overflows/crashes/glitches.<br>
<br>
Plus none of the old plug-ins work: meaning servers are in a state of mayhem with admins not able to control it, and there were hardly any servers today, because no-one had changed it over to the orangebox yet.<br>
<br>
I was very annoyed that most of the things that I thought they would fix they didn't. I still crash at random intervals for no reason, gameplay is still very glitchy (especially with the magnum) when your ping is high. Maps seem laggier or sluggish for some reason, like the orangebox makes it worse. And I thought that they were going to show on the top-right hand corner if you got a headshot kill like counter-strike. Also in-game names are based off your steam profile. That means whenever I'm in a server I have to change my steam name everytime (e.g. .org tag in .org servers -&gt; whenever i want to be icognito etc).<br>
<br>
Personally the whole 'cant sprint straight after a crouch' is quite annoying but I can live with it. However for others I can understand why they absolutely hate it. This is a fast-paced game. Removing fast movements of bhopping has ruined parts of this fast pace therefore ruining the unique play of deathmatch. <br>
<br>
On a note: there are some things I like: like the fire and the new model for the orbs... PLUS Hammer is much cooler now and takes about a 1/5 of the time to compile the vrad. Is prettier too... <br>
<br>
But one thing that Valve has done is killed a game that was dying... Great work. You should have just left the gameplay as it was and kept the goodness of prettiness of the orangebox.<br>

	<div class="content">my post in the above mentioned steamforums thread regarding what i observed while playing last night...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>i'll just throw these out there for people to agree with or debunk as the usual bug unfixed...<br>
<br>
in addition to no speed crawl and crippled bhob coming out of crouch mentioned above... <br>
<br>
scroll jump no longer works adequately. this has been attributed to linux servers only... i dont know how to verify that. but if you attempt to bhop with scroll wheel jump you will "stick" to the floor about 50% of the time. you can stay in one place, stationary, and just scroll jump w/o moving (standing and crouched both) and see the effect. <br>
<br>
strafing up inclines gets you a lot more air, seems much easier to glide/slide up inclines. i could nearly make it from caverns above rpg (strafe over grate area) up to the open area behind supercharger... w/o using jump at all. and my movement is ♥♥♥♥e. so im sure other people will be able to do that and more on other maps.<br>
<br>
fast orbs seem faster and more difficult to catch (more testing needed).<br>
<br>
frag nades seems to explode quicker than the 5 secs, frag nades more difficult to catch, frag nades splash damage seems more powerful (more testing needed on all).<br>
<br>
i initially thought the shotty had become less powerful and more consistant. then i killed holy on caverns with a double shotty from sewer to ramp double-health corner. he was afk, so i guess he could have had 1 health while standing on top of the unspawned healthpacks. still a stupid kill for that distance imho.<br>
<br>
yo-yo-ing anything is more difficult. frag nades and orbs are easier than props.<br>
<br>
glitch prop/jumping/flying seems to be gone. grav/prop jumping seems to work easier.<br>
<br>
mag seemed overpowered, but i suspect its actually due to better hit registry.<br>
<br>
more blood graphics? but a strange difference i noticed with shotty. close combat produced more blood, but farther away showed no blood... just puffs of smoke instead... even though it registered as hits. i think i was mostly on pure=0 servers and i do have hd effects... so that may just be my issue.<br>
<br>
previous demos no workie... this is devastating to those with works in progress. </div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">A lot of you guys sound like 2 year olds. They just moved dm to the Orange Box. That in itself is a gift. The OB engine is 1000x better then the engine this old ass game was running on. If they dont fix the bugs that is one thing, but they would have to know that there would be bugs that need fixed. Why would they update it and not be prepare to fix the bugs? Doesnt make sense. So if you find bugs, post them in the bug thread in the dm steam forum and lets go from there. They are much more likely to update this game since it is on the Orange Box now and much more relevant now. It may also be a good idea to create a bug thread here too. I have Mike Durand's email info and can send him the bugs that are found. Im pretty sure that Mike is still the head cheese with anything source code related. I'd also like to point out that some of the stuff being listed as issues is not. For example, not being able to speed crawl is not a bug. That is called a bug being removed via the Orange Box. Also, I doubt any mod is going to work right now until they are updated. Source mod will just have to update their shit so it works with dm:OB and same goes for mani or whatever. If you are a mapper, you should update all your maps to the Orange Box as well. They will run better anyways.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm sorry to burst your little bubble but i keep reading and hearing people saying this game will "die" if Valve doesn't fix this or that - News break :<br>
the Game won't die. It won't die because the majority of players are very happy and do not feel a thing with the port.<br>
What people here actually mean is that the <em class="text-italics">Competitive community</em> will die, which is quite possible should Valve leave the game in its current state.<br>
less than 5% of the total player base can hardly create a whistle. let alone if they keep on doing it separately by trolling forums such as this.<br>
Supporting the OB mod is cool but the problem with it is simple - only the competitive community will play it and without an ongoing influx from the outside of new players it will die just the same, only a bit later.<br>
Don't get me wrong - i'm all for anything that keeps this game alive because i love this game. but i think it's important for people to see a bigger part of the picture.<br>
<br>
Valve opens up its product line to the Mac audience and wish to give an added value for any new customer.<br>
Keeping in mind the term CUSTOMER - a person who pays money to get something. money being "20-50$", something being "a game" (one of the following: CS:S, TF2, HL2..etc.)<br>
They line up all their game by internally aligning their engine revisions to one type - Source (OB) 2009.<br>
In the case of Mac customers who purchase HL2, as we know, there is in place already an added benefit in the form of HL2DM: A Free game.<br>
Valve ports all their game to the new engine and it's a massive undertaking which takes a lot of time to do and manpower.<br>
Keeping in mind all this is happening while the company is a big strain to release a new title ASAP + Support two problematic games (L4D1 and L4D2) having promissed to release DLCs to an already paid for, waiting and getting angrier public + the amount of work yet to be done and still ongoing on EP3 and Portal 2.<br>
If you think about it you will easily understand that they will operate in a high to low priority method: what's most important gets done - what's less important gets done last or not at all.<br>
This is it and this is how it is always done in ALL software companies. There are deadlines to meet and Sales leads to follow.<br>
HL2DM is not dead and never has been - the only reason it's been called Dead is because some people love Drama, can't endure change, feel sorry for themselves, etc.<br>
The truth is - HL2DM had a very early peak in public interest when HL2 was the place to be and then public interest shifted and moved on to other games. the crown that stayed with HL2DM shrunk but more or less kept as in through the years.<br>
The community that received the biggest blow is the competitive one. that's a fact.<br>
The same community now sits here and thinks it's the next thing to god and that nothing else exist outside of it. You're obviously not getting out much. lighten the fuck up and open your eyes:<br>
Most players don't bhop<br>
Most players don't even know what bhop is<br>
same goes for speed skating, speed crouching and so on. period.<br>
Your numbers are few and your voices die out inside the greater audience.<br>
The fact that a very well rooted prejudice is strongly tied to your community isn't helping: that bhop is a cheat and that adv. players scare away noobs.<br>
<br>
Another fact: Valve is the farthest thing from a remote, indifferent group of rich assholes siting in a corporate-style office up a high mountain and laughs as more fools pay good money for their games. Valve has and hopefully always will be a group of uber talented and enthusiastic young people who dream a lot and down to the last man - all play the games they create. they are part of their own games communities and are very active in this. very very active. if you don't know that that's your lack of knowledge but that's the truth. i've seen it and am part of it for a while now.<br>
<br>
The above being said, as a company they HAVE to meet market demands and keep on making money to survive!<br>
Therefore, The only way you can get Valve to listen to your issues is by creating enough movement so that they will notice it.<br>
This can be done by:<br>
<br>
* Creating a Steam Group that lays out it's agenda and sending out invites to everyone willing to listen.<br>
* Emailing Valve employees and product managers constantly.<br>
* Posting on Steam forums constantly.<br>
* Seeking out Mac forums and other games forums and posting on there as well in the hope of getting more people behind your cause.<br>
* All this requires involvement and commitment from this community.<br>
<br>
That's it and that's what it is. now it's each and every one of you all's turn to make a decision whether or not you are willing to spend few minutes of your day or week in getting this game fixed.<br>
<br>
Enjoy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's health informs as to the entire health of the game.<br>

<br>
I was not commenting on hit reg or bunnyhopping. I was commenting on the fact this is not a robust newish game with an influx of players and lots of crowded awesome Pubs. It is just a statement of fact. There are not a lot of good Pubs to play.<br>
<br>
Again, this isn't whining but a point that DM lovers have to keep the game going. Except the movement (and all my settings up high ridiculously, now fixed) i don't dislike the update.<br>
I believe it is all we will get, except maybe a single smaller update to fix some things, which will probably happen. Valve wouldn't port it if they weren't intent on making it work well with the port.<br>
<br>
So, really what i'm saying is work to fix a few things and then deal with it.<br>

	<div class="content">I got a feeling that this update will be the making or breaking of this game. I did say that if this game gets updated I might just come to the game and in fact I have noticed some old names pop up during the past few days.  So may be this could be the revival we need but these bugs need fixing quick so we can capitalise on it. <br>
<br>
A quick observation and players seem to fit into three groups on the matter<br>
1. hl2dm Armageddon preachers "HL2DM is dead" translation "my life is over now what am I do"    <br>
2. Rose tinted glasses group "everything is perfect I can adapt to these changes" translation "im leet all those moaning are noobs"<br>
3. Sitting on the fence group "Update has issues that need fixing" translation "still pissed but at least they updated the game but we should not have these issues"<br>
<br>
I kinda fit in group 3 well to be honest I was steering towards group 1 at the beginning. What annoys me about this is there has been no communication from the developers on what they are doing it was just 'hey we are porting to OB' and that was it absolutely nothing after that. Anyway here hoping valve employees are smart enough to foresee that there will be some problems in the first update in the last three and that they have scheduled a quickie update after it.<br>
<br>
I remain hopeful but sceptical. Also I will rip into anyone in the first and second group for future reference. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's already proven a revival as you see so many new players coming in so that's a fact.<br>
"these bugs need fixing" - they will. HL2DM is a paid for game and there are quite a few bugs aside the bhop ones <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> Valve is obviously going to fix them and very soon.<br>
"quick" - you know this one is tricky. I claim the more more people here contact Valve and post on Steam forum about the bugs closer to them the better chance those will be fix in the first batches.<br>
Note that on the previous engine it was hellish for anyone to go in and try to make any changes in the mess-of-a-code HL2DM was in. Porting it to the OB was crucial for Valve to be able to go in and change/fix things.<br>

This is just due to the grav gun bug where pressing the grav gun bind while holding an object will cause the object to glitch out and freeze where it was. In the case with grenades it doesn't seem to act like any regular object, it just falls to the ground as if you dropped it. I'm pretty sure you must be hitting the grav bind one too many times or something because this hasn't happened to me at all, and I have tested it a lot. It's either that or you got the order of switchings/shoot/grab mixed up, try it a bunch of times and check if it works at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

* Attempting to craft a non tradable item will result in a warning that the items produced by the craft will also be marked as non tradable.<br>
* Community, Self-Made, and Valve items are not tradable or usable in crafting.<br>
* Changed "Not Craftable" description to "Not Usable in Crafting" to increase clarity.<br>
<br>

* The TF badge on the Glengarry Bonnet is no longer team colored.<br>
* Restored the missing PDA2 Slot Token.<br>
* Restored the appearance of the Tippler's Tricorne to the version prior to the Mannconomy Update. This item is now paintable.<br>

* Changed the way that scope zooming works so that it is no longer affected by client-server latency, and zooming begins immediately for the local player. This fixes an issue that would give an advantage to lower ping players and penalize higher ping players.<br>
* Fixed animation problem caused by aborting bomb plant by switching weapons ("crab walk").<br>
* Crosshairs now have customizable size, thickness, and color:<br>
* cl_crosshairsize specifies the size of the crosshair in pixels at 640x480 resolution<br>
* cl_crosshairthickness specifies the thickness of the crosshair in pixels at 640x480 resolution<br>
* The crosshair now scales proportionately for all screen resolutions. This replaces the old scaling behavior, and the cvar cl_crosshairscale is no longer used. Players can revert to old crosshair behavior by setting cl_legacy_crosshair_scale to 1.<br>
* Setting cl_crosshaircolor to 5 enables the use of custom crosshair colors, specified by cvars cl_crosshaircolor_r, cl_crosshaircolor_g, and cl_crosshaircolor_b.<br>
* The default of cl_crosshairuseapha has been changed to 1. Alpha blending makes the crosshair much more visible on new HDR maps, and it is recommended that existing players enable this setting manually or through the options interface (Multiplayer-Crosshair appearance-Translucent).<br>
* Cvar cl_legacy_crosshair has been renamed to cl_legacy_crosshair_recoil for consistency.<br>
* Fixed inverted translucency preview on crosshair configuration panel.<br>
* Removed the ability for players to temporarily stand on and jump from thrown grenades and jumping players. Legacy behavior can be enabled by setting sv_enableboost to 1.<br>
* Fixed issue with players "stacking" on ladders. Players are no longer prevented from moving off a ladder when they are in contact with a player beneath them.<br>
* Fixed UI issue causing Steam dialog boxes to be unreadable over certain backgrounds.<br>
* Fixed a bug which allowed players to move the bomb with +use when sv_turbophysics was enabled.<br>
* Fixed a bug that caused crosshair to expand when attempting to fire an empty gun or when holding trigger on pistols.<br>
* Players are no longer kicked for team killing during mp_spawnprotectiontime if mp_autokick is not enabled.<br>
* Fixed a bug which caused incorrect FoV on zoomed sniper rifles after reload.<br>
* Fixed FoV on wide-screen display modes.<br>
* Fixed a bug which caused incorrect zoom for a spectator watching a player with a sniper rifle.<br>
* Fixed a crash that could occur if a player disconnected shortly after attacking a bot.<br>
* Bomb icon now has priority over dominated/dominating icon on scoreboard.<br>

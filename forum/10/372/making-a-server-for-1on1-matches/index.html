	<div class="content">In the last days I been working on a server made exclusivly for running one on one matches.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">&gt; What the F am I talking about?</strong><br>
<br>
It's a Source Dedicated Server running under Windows 2003 Server Edition SP2 at 67Tickrate and 500FPS (extremely tweaked to be REAL 67tick-500fps)<br>
<br>
It is limited to 4 slots, 2 free for players, 1 reserved for an admin and another one that is going to be always used by SourceTV.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">&gt; What is the difference with the rest of servers?</strong><br>
<br>
This server will be perfectly set to have the minus latency possible and the highest rates avaible, giving the less hit-registration problems as possible.<br>
<br>
Why? Simple, it's based to be played by regional players, with less than 100ms. So the frame interpolation and prediction will be disabled, reducing hit registration problems a LOT (of course that having a real cmd/updaterate 67 and a smoothly 500fps helps, too). Also, both players will be forced to use cl_cmdrate "66" as min and "67" as max.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">&gt; Which plug-ins would this server use?</strong><br>
<br>
The server MUST use Source MetaMod (<a href="http://www.sourcemm.net/" class="postlink">http://www.sourcemm.net/</a>) with the following addons:<br>

If you guys are really interested on HowTo set up a high-perfomance server for 1on1 matches, I can make a guide so most of countries/areas are able to have one.<br>

Thanks for your time.<br>

Well, maps maybe choose by everyone. In my server I already have:<br>
<br>
aim_arena_reloaded<br>
dm_lockdown_r3<br>
dm_lockdown2<br>
dm_zeta_prefinal<br>
dm_lostvillage<br>
dm_resistance_r1<br>
dm_7hour<br>
dm_overwatch<br>
dm_underpass<br>
dm_crossfire<br>
dm_biohazard<br>
<br>
But I have aim_arena_reloaded 24/7 till the map begins (because it's 4 slots only)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ah, excellent. To expand slightly on Charles comment, anything non-hitscan is abuseable, which is the only reason hitsounds are still banned in CAL. A version of the plugin with sounds for only pistol / smg primary / ar2 primary / shotgun / mag would be great for competitive play.<br>
<br>
Mag headshot notification with a default sound and no screen text would be great too.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

I will make it so it is configureable.  I for one don't see the xbow as a non hitscan weapon.  I know technically it is.  But it doesn't fall in the same vein as the splash damage and self directing orbs.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I don't know if it is abusable.  My arena is wide open and usually a straight shot, so I'll have to rely on your guys judgement.<br>
<br>
My plan is a non hacking plugin that will allow hitsounds and overtime or sudden death.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well I might wait for the next update to finish this off.<br>
<br>
Supposedly they are going to add hitbox recognition to the player_hurt and player_death events so I won't have to hack.<br>
<br>
Also, they can also add the "(headshot)" into the logs.  It took 5 lines of code, and I forwarded it onto VALVe.  Hopefully, since they won't have to do much work they'll include it.<br>
<br>
So the question is, release a plugin now with hacks?  or wait for the one without hacks?<br>
<br>
And for the most part, plugins do not do anything to affect the performance of the game.  The problem is when we (the plugin makers) do calculations during the gameframes.  The only reason we need to do this is multikill and JIHAD determination.  The rest get called by the engine only when necessary.  I guess if somebody did a lot of useless code during death/connecting events that could slow some things down.  For this plugin tho, I wouldn't even use gameframe calcs, so you wouldn't even notice it was there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Basically anything that can hit an opponent you cant see becomes a problem as it can have game-altering effects on tactics and player behavior. Hitscan of course is the opposite in that it solves a problem instead, specifically the unreliablility of blood as a hit detection method.<br>
<br>
Id personally say hold off until it can be done without hacks. The cleaner the plugin ultimately is, the better; any decrease in the chance of glitches or crashes in a match is worth waiting for.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

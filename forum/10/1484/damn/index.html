	<div class="content">As some of you know, I'm stuck at a college that doesn't allow steam to run in online mode. Therefore, no hl2dm. This spring break I utilized bittorrent to obtain a nonsteam copy of hl2dm, and I tested it out and it does indeed work over the lan. This made me exceedingly happy...for about all of 10 minutes when I realized that I had no one to play with. So it's almost worse being able to play but nobody's interested. I got my roommate to test it with me but him and everybody else says it wouldn't be fun because I would just rape them, and there's nobody that's willing to take the time out of their school to learn how to play. Out of 5,000 students here there must be someone out there that has played and enjoys this game, right? I'll keep hoping and wishing.<br>
<br>
Sorry WT for this questionably illegal topic. Be it known that I've purchased over 150 bucks of games from steam.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There was a guy in my clan that had similar problems he mentioned something abou this program, it does increase your ping though becasue it goes from your pc to their servers then to the steam servers or something. its a bit hazy to be honest.  I will have a dig on our forums coz im sure he posted about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm thinking that's the only way to play this game. I'm not really sure I would want to try the program above mentioned :/ I would need to know that it was really safe.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

But it looks legit, and I look forward to playing it someday.

	<div class="content">You guys remind me of the Fallout community, lol.  They are like one of the complete worst fan bases a game could EVER have.  They hated fallout 3 when it was in development (hell they hate fallout 1-2 too), and what do you know?  It turned out to be a badass game, lol.  Look at TF2 when it was in development, shit tons didnt like it just cause of graphical style.  But in the end 90% of people loved it.  The same thing is happening with diablo 3.  Theyre bitching at blizzard cause the graphics colors are too vivid and a whole slew of other crap.  Look up diablo 3 unicorn class/marshmallow man in google to see what happened.<br>
<br>
Notice a pattern?  All of those games weren't even touched in like over 5 or 6 years &amp; all their fan bases bitched @ them about the new sequel.  Not saying duke nukem forever will be good, or that it will even release  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> but I mean its funny how people are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Hardcore fans are hardcore fans because they feel this game had it all. Of course they are afraid of changes, the game was already perfect for them, and you can't fuck with perfection.<br>
<br>
Basically just see it as if valve would finally announce then  release HL3DM and in the end you find out there won't be BHOP in it. That's how they feel, and you'd feel the same.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

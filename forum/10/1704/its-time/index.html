	<div class="content">Well, I know I've said it before... and I know I've also said I was serious before but... this time I am as serious as I can be. It's finally come time for me to just, quti hl2dm. A lot of you reading this... probably 99.9% maybe even 100... I don't care but, I'll guarantee that a lot of people are going to be like, "heh? why are all the servers quiet?" then another will be all like... "Oh that shit face, ass talking, douche bag... teto... has left hl2dm that's why" then everyone will be like, "true, true... now that he's gone, we can sex in peace." anyways, I don't want to know about your sex lives.<br>
<br>
Hm... *thinks of what to type*..<br>
AH, yes... Some of you might be wondering why I am leaving this game, now I will say it.<br>
I've been super busy... a lot of shit to do, not forcing me to quti the game, but you know... these are the main reasons, the people in it... again, I've mentioned this before... EVERYONE RELYS ON CAL FOR ALL OF THEIR MATCHES!!! Everyone it seems is to afraid to actually lose to eachother, which is why I'll bet luke and seagull didn't play their first cal 1v1. Another thing, this is to Seagull, honestly man, not to start shit, but I know I could beat you... people say you could win, people say I could win, people say you're scarred... and I agree with that last one. Honestly though, I think it would be close no doubt... but not playing someone because if you lose, * you probably would * and you not wanting to lose your rep. that's a truly gay reason.<br>
<br>
Another person, and last person I am going to talk about... Luke, good ol' luke, you're a cool guy... you've taught me some shit, we've ALSO actually played before, but Kigha said there was a reason for you not playing me, which I find odd... probably because I talk a bit,  then I might have gotten pissed in the past, but that was so long ago... my honest opinion about why you won't play me, is also because you are afraid of losing... I remember the very last time we played, I was up on points against you.. it was close, but I was up... I CRASHED, you didn't... so you restarted it and said that wasn't a win and that I'd have to earn it, after that it's been SO fucking long since we've played, I've gotten SO much better, it seems you wouldn't play me because you knew now, that I would probably win.<br>
You're a cool guy, but excuses like "Oh I would really like to play you some time man, but see... I'm hungry and I don't play well on an empty stomach." that shit doesn't cut it, I know that's not a true reason, that's a bitch move... but it's fine.<br>
<br>
Anyways this is my very last post. I will never post again, and if I play it will only to be to fuck around and it will be very rare of me to play. A lot of you again are probably happy, and that's ok with me but honestly, everyone I was a dick too... I thank you, seriously thank you because that made this game a hell of a lot more fun for me. The only few people I would like to thank here for actually teaching me is Mr. Crowbar for getting me started and [VDuS] Bio for showing me everything. Then there's invx and blast, homies. True. Bahlk, coo cat. Anyways guys, feel free to leave any type of comment towards me that you would like to, flame if you'd like even... I just want to see people's true opinions. (keep in mind I will not reply to any comments to anyone after this). I understand flaming isn't allowed in the forums but I hope giving you my permission to talk about me here.. so I can see what damage I did would be great. Thanks everyone. GOOD GAME AXON!<br>
<br>
-Love teto-<br>

<br>
1. How many times have I heard this from you before?<br>
2. Do you really expect people to take it seriously this time?<br>
3. If your really all that, the next season is getting ready to start, prove yourself, don't quti this time.<br>
4. I do think it's kinda lame that people refuse to play when asked and only leads people to believe they are afraid of losing.<br>
<br>
If anyone has a problem with #4, I feel sorry for you, excuses are lame, set a time that you can play and play. See no one will ever be undefeated for life, isn't gonna happen no way no how.<br>

	<div class="content">Want my honest opinion? Here it is...<br>
<br>
What people need to understand is that if you act like a dick, people wont want to 1v1 you.<br>
<br>
It is not that people are scared. It is that they don't want to lose to someone they know is only playing so they can go jerk off to everyone about how they beat a player who is largely considered better.<br>
<br>
With hacks so readily available and no formal way to keep a match fair, a random 1v1 is meaningless anyway. Join CAL 1v1 if proving you can beat someone is that important to you.<br>
<br>
I'll 1v1 anyone, I don't care about winning or losing, but if you talk shit to me, forget it. Honestly with everything that is said to Seagull, I'm surprised he plays anyone. Call me scared and I will simply tell you to fuck off, you are playing me for the wrong reasons.<br>

and @ blas me and you never had problems but ace is another story and from that screen i see ace is in the match and personally, to me, he hasn't been the "nicest" person around either, so idk that could have something to do with it but i am just saying this from a spectators POV, idk what happened in that match, dont care tbh but i just wanted to throw my 2 cents in.<br>
edit* basically, what im saying is was did someone instigate something to cause him to say this or just said it, if he said it out of no where k he started it. but if it was instigated then poo on you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

And about this, you gotta love it when someone feels the need to make flimsy excuses after a loss like this, if that was the case what were they doing playing in the first place. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> Excuses now thats pathetic!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Problem was he (seagull) wasn't making any excuse in regards to ace being a dick, he was making a excuse for his own poor game play and that of his teammate. Acting like that is no worse then the way some people perceive Teto and Ace's behavior in game. In fact its dropping straight down to the same level. <br>
This is the great thing about screenshots, if you want to act like a child everyone is likely to see it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I see what you mean, but you're right I don't mean it that way exactly, I grew up dealing with "tough guys" in real life who were far from it in the end, and to see someone act like this on the internet it's a laugh at first but after a while it's old as hell.<br>
<br>
Many people know I am one of the nicest people you'll meet on the internet but in rl I've been locked up all my life always used to be in trouble fighting all the damn time for stupid reasons, I learned how dumb that shit was a long time ago, then people on the internet think it's fun but they won't do it in rl so they dragnet the internet looking for people to "bully" and pick at.<br>
<br>
If you wouldn't do it to my face then don't do it is pretty much what I'm getting at here.<br>
<br>
EDIT:L2K I never meant to direct that post toward you at all, you have never disrespected me in any way ever, these internet "tough guys" know exactly who they are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol I'm fine with the people saying what they have to say, I just wanted to point some things out, people should at least get their facts straight before commenting, and no, I have not played you... if I did, and I said something to you... it couldn't have been even that bad, I would have remembered it, and if you're just being retarded about some little put down, then that's your own fault haha.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
but teto imo has come along way from when i first met him (complete douche lol..) and unless there is more to the picture i am missing, i think this animosity may be from the old teto. At least from my experience teto has been a really cool guy and taught me alot.<br>
<br>
and everybody gets mad about alot of different things, and in a community this small it is bound to happen more<br>

lol I don't have to ask anyone, I've seen it for myself, you try to sound tough when you're mad, and if someone would really take the game SO seriously it drove them to fist fighting in real life about it, that's pathetic on their part, I have no problems telling people to their face that I am better at a video game than them lol. If that's that case, you fist fight with people because you get told you're not as good as your opponent at a video game, you my friend, dear, have problems.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i never got into a fist fight over a game like i said i get over it 10 min later. after i quti that game i lost to you by 1 point i rejoined..you guessed it 10 min later and was fine. only fist fight ive ever gotten into over this game was with my door and if you count a person vs a door a fight...sweet bro. <br>
<br>
i might take shit seriously but then whats the point of playing if youre not serious? isnt the main goal to win? i dont believe you can win without a serious attitude and thats my opinion you can have yours but i feel this way about all sports/games/videogames.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you're a fucking idiot, I wasn't talking about YOU getting into the fist fight, I was talking in general if PEOPLE  DO get into real life fights, and you're the pathetic one, I've never broke anything while angry over a video game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

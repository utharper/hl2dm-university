Well, he specified he wanted something for his server, so he absolutely wants to download something. Now, I don't know about you guys but I rather a solid-stable HL2DM than a regular HL2DM unstable highly-crasheable with no 1v1 mode at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is true, but if he finds someone in HL2DM that he wants to play. He's not going to say "Hey, could you download this mod so we can 1v1?"<br>

First, he doesn't have a server. Second, nobody is going to want to download a mod to play 1v1.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The problem is that only a few know <a href="http://www.hl2dmpro.com" class="postlink">www.hl2dmpro.com</a><br>

The 80-90% of players just click on their Steam Games list and double-click on 'Half-Life 2: Deathmatch'. They are noobs, yes. But, you NEED noobs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I can't see steam updating this game ever, so the chances of Janek releasing his OB Pro mod before Valve update DM is highly likely. But I also can't see that many people playing it either as about 90% of DM players are committed and faithful to this giltchy piece of shit game.<br>

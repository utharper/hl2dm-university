	<div class="content">Well you also have yto understand that no matter how hard you practice on ptrain (wich isn't a bad thing). Whenever you enter any map it's not about doing one very very long jump, the floor levels are often differents, and you gotta know how to manage your sprint dealing with stairs, ramps, railings, random props blocking the way and on and on....<br>
<br>
ptrain is good to see your progress of understanding of the very core of the technique, but it's still requires alot of self-judgement and map experience AND game experience aswell.<br>
<br>
see ptrain as those huge plane's roads in International airports. they take cars there and check how fast they can go because it's the place offering the best condition to do so. let's say you "trained" at the airport with your ferrari for awhile and you know that you can go at like 450 km/h, when you hit the streets it's a different story right? hills, traffic, curves. Unless you're a fucking pro and a nutcase, you won't be hauling ass like crazy. What i'm saying is, one could beat ptrain backward but could also hit every single walls in a match because he cant deal with the OBSTACLES+AIMING+MAP PATH along with his bhop technique.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">IMO</span></strong> ptrain should be used to see if you have increased your technique (speed) and then when you realise that, apply the new speed ingame and "get used to it"<br>
<br>
That's all folks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You can practice strafing into a crouched jump, release all direction keys and just learn the crouched/jump timing. This may help you get out of the habit of using sprint and forward.<br>
Forward (W) is very bad!  Its so counter-intuitive, moving forward by moving side to side. Its just plain weird.<br>
<br>
Once you have strafe jumped, you will need to go to strafe keys w/mouse movement to get that slide or speed going. You don't need to curve the mouse a lot. Too much and you lose speed.<br>
<br>
Navigating around corners is a matter of using consecutive left or right strafes, instead of left/right/left/right...<br>
<br>
You can use two or three rights or lefts and still maintain a more or less straight line.<br>
Or you can mix it up, making figures 8s.<br>
<br>
If you are low grav and turn in the air with the mouse, that is air control and gives you an idea what the strafe keys/mouse movement is doing for you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you have low aux all the time try to jump more times in between pressing sprint again and don't rush everywhere just take it slow don't keep pressing sprint whenever you can.<br>
<br>
Practice makes perfect, if you want to get good like these skilled players you talk about, just keep trying and trying you will master movement within time.<br>
<br>
Also don't forget to use left and right to move forwards otherwise you won't be able to turn corners :p</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Practice is a key and it will just come naturally once you do it once or twice. I'll be glad to help anytime I can....if you want some solo practice fire up Lost Village and practice the jump from the crates/trailer to the shotgun and check your velocity while you strafe jump. Also ask someone who is good with strafing to help you with the Lockdown Leap...good practice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>There's a new Steam Beta client available. To access the Beta, go to File -&gt; Settings. On the Account tab press the Change... button to open the Beta Participation dialog. Then Select Beta Update, and allow Steam to restart itself. Here are the specific changes:<br>
<br>
1/31/2011<br>
<br>
- Changed microphone voice input from 11khz to 16 khz<br>
- Changed voice output from 8khz to 16khz<br>
- Moved game invites from friends outside of the chat stream, into their own panel in the chat dialog<br>
- [Mac OSX] Fixed a problem where attempting to resume a paused/interrupted download could always report ‘server unavailable’<br>
- Fixed games not launching automatically after resolving a cloud conflict<br>
- Fixed download rate sometimes erroneously reporting very high speeds<br>
- Added password strength meter when you change your password<br>
- Added UI prompting you to choose a new password if you've had support change your password<br>
- Added Steam screenshots feature. Press F12 in any game to take a screenshot. Screenshots are automatically uploaded to the steam cloud after exiting the game, or can be manually uploaded while in-game through the in-game overlay. Screenshots can be managed through the community site and can be published to your Steam Community Profile to share with your friends. Games that use DirectX 8 and earlier are not yet supported.<br>
<br>
There will also be a thread specifically for feedback about the screenshot feature: <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=837" class="postlink">http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/f ... .php?f=837</a></div></blockquote>

<br>
You may find the screenshot feature is <strong class="text-strong">shift+ins</strong>  not F12<br>
<br>

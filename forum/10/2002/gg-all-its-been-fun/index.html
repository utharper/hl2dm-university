	<div class="content">Well, I am officially quitting hl2dm after this cal season finishes. some reasons, too much bullshit talking, no updates, not having fun anymore playing this game, and most people just dont see what your trying to do, even if your busting your ass trying to help the community, the only person that really saw what i was doing for them was POMP, so thx pomp, hope you get better and have fun. still had good times with you all, even my haters <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> One thing though, we WILL make a flaS vid before quitting, so all of you have a little memory of us, we will try to make it before the cal season finishes.<br>
<br>
Peace to all my close friends: Zman, Ninjins, Book, Phantom, Conflict, gas_mask, Pomp. And all the others that helped me get at the level im at in this game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

With people like Confused who tried giving back so much and certainly helped me and Team V leaving it will make it so much more difficult for new teams to get up and going.

The reason I post the sarcastic "I'm quitting" remarks is because there are so many threads started indicating, well, you guessed it....I'm quitting!!  9 times out of 10 these people aren't going to quti, they just had a bad run of matches, got a little peeved and said "that's it".  "This game is no fun anymore, all players are jerks, Valve sux, blah blah".  I just find it humorous to see these threads and find out those people are back to playing 3 days later!!  Makes me LMAO!!  You're right about one thing, you haven't seen me in any servers you're on, maybe that's intentional (plus I don't play as dbanimal)!!  Come Winter, I usually spend tons of time playing.  Seems to be the only fun thing to do all Winter long.  Come Spring and Summer, once again you won't see much of me.

I have every right in the world to post a sarcastic reply to his post because I say there is a very good chance that in the end, he's not going to quti.  If this is truly how he feels and his HL2DM days are soon to be over and never return, then I truly feel sorry that we lost another good player.  This website is dedicated to promoting and spreading the good word about HL2DM.  To see threads labeled "I'm quitting" is kind of a downer IMO and is sending the message that there may be no hope for this game and that we should just give up - it depends on their reasons for quitting in the first place.  Those people have the right to say how they feel about it and why they're quitting but at the same time I'm going to give a sarcastic remark - I'm just trying to keep the dream alive and would like to see things stay positive around here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its unreal engine  and a few unreal engien games to my knowledge thesedays have shitty mouse support Bioshock an Bulletstorm I know for sure do so for Duke to be unaffected by good mouse support will surprise me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

To my knowledge as of writing that.<br>
after thinking a bit hard (I had to take a break I felt dizzy afterwards) Bad company2 has shit mouse support too the mousewheel is classed as an axis so its impossible to bind 2 seperate actions to it other than "next/previous weapon"</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

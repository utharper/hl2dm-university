Loved Oblivion but you played the hell out of it but you're still up for more?<br>
<br>
This total conversion of Oblivion, some says this mod is what Elder Scroll 4 should've been.<br>
<br>
This is relatively old new but I just found out:<br>

That gives Oblivion+DLC the most gigantic kick in the balls one could imagine...something like this:<br>

Every single area/dungeon is custom built! If you explored most of the dungeons in Oblivion you are almost guaranteed to find some kind of duplicate dungeon or ones that look extremely similar. With Nehrim every dungeon is different, with most containing custom models specially made for it. This just makes you want to explore dungeons to see what they might contain.<br>
<br>
I like the way they have changed levelling so then you only need XP to gain levels rather than increasing skills. But I noticed that there is only 1 skill that can increase your speed and about 5 which can increase your intelligence, making it a bit unbalanced. <br>
<br>
I noticed that there is a few downfalls though. For example you can travel everywhere in the map even if you are in a high level area. I was on lvl 7 and I stumbled in a lvl 30 area and got smashed! Plus the story is a little dull, where everywhere you go it gets destroyed in a series of minutes of being there. <br>
<br>
As far as I can see the only thing that is terrible about this game is that most of the Non-Player_Character's don't even want to talk to you unless you are on a mission and you need to speak with them. By doing this they have limited the amount of missions that you can find other than the main mission.<br>
<br>
But seriously: Schnell, play this game, schnell!<br>
<br>
P.S. Keine Zeit. Ich bin im Dienst.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I can mod for Oblivion/Fallout, PROTOTYPE &amp; most valve's games. To some extent.<br>
<br>
I don't have time to work on any mods/sites/paintjob/kidnappings/extortion/babysitting business at the moment.<br>
<br>
These are mostly texture mods but I try to make them turn the game something different/interesting<br>
<br>
for example:<br>

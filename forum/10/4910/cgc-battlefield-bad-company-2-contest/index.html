lol<br>
<br>
Good point, but if you already have the game whats the point of writing the essay?   Unless you gave it to your friend that doesnt have it so you can play together.<br>
In any case use your imagination, maybe they will give extra points for creativity and humor.  I am more entertained by a humorous tale than a strictly factual one arent you?<br>
<br>
Very generous of CGC to have such a contest and give away the game like this.<br>
Great game IMHO.  Been playing it alot lately and I like it alot.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Do a little research perhaps. If you are interested in the game you should do a little research on it anyways right? It doesnt have to be a 1000 word essay. It's up to 1000 words. And the lady of the thread hit the nail on the head. You can use your imagination <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Ode to the sniper<br>
A BFBC2 short essay<br>
by {EE}chEmicalbuRn.</span></strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Of all the classes available in the new FPS "Battlefield Bad Company 2" there is only one that reigns supreme in my eyes. Although the topic of many hateful words; "camper", "you're not doing anything to help the team", "Snipers not welcome in this server." It is the sniper that controls the game. <br>
As I sit crouched high above the battlefield, taking in all the explosions and blood shead, I do something that few players have the patience for. <br>
<br>
The common thought of snipers like myself is all we are doing is camping. This couldnt be further than the truth. Through hard work and dedication to learning the maps, control points, paths most traveled, I have unlocked scopes and rifles that allow me to see the action and relay that information to my fellow squad mates. With this information they have a jump on who is coming and from what direction. I can also place motion sensors that will detect the most ninja like of players trying to take our flag down. Not only am I watching over my team like a hawk looking for prey for its young, I am listening to the sounds of the game. Listening for the sounds of machine gun fire, explosions, and tank movement. All this valuable information is transmitted into the headsets of my squadmates. Now, because of me, they have priceless data that can help them make game time decisions on what path to take, where the injured are, where the vehicles that need repair are located. With all this on my shoulders, I still have another responsibility. Protecting my teammates. With my 12x optical scope I can see the other team from a far, even coming out of their deployment spawn point. Many a time I have silently taken out assualt troops heading to a cap point where my team is. My team unknowingly enjoys the spoils of my patience and dedication to accuracy. I have increased my sniping skills to a point where i can take out the other teams snipers from far across the map. As their head snaps back and their body turns to jello, they fall to the ground with one thought in mind, "where the hell did that come from?" Well, good sir, you part time sniping noob, it came from me, the man waiting in the shadows. Now take your 15 second respawn timeout to think about where I was hiding. Cause I wont miss the second time either.<br>
<br>
I am the control tower of this game, so hop in your tank, or jump on your ATV to get back in the action. A well placed mortor attack is about to rain on your parade.<br>
Long live the sniper.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yup, I like this game a lot. Enough that if we had a few more guys that could actually run the game on their pcs this contest would of been in house. Unfortunately, all the CGC guys that can pretty much run the game have it already.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

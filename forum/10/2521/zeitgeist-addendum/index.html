That's exactly the problem. Maybe you start to care who is in charge now that US is in trouble with their economy, which I consider not a problem since fixing these problems are as easy as fixing a game server. It's better preventing than repairing, this video ignores completely the climatic change, and of course these "conspiracy guys" don't care since they already bought lakes and areas where the global warming is not going to affect that much. But the rest of the population is going to go into chaos just for water, while they hold big lakes and rivers in mountains.<br>

I finished watching this movie yesterday. I think they skipped lot of true facts and I am going to e-mail these forgotten/skipped stuff to them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

While I agree the climate issues are important, I firmly believe that the corpacracy that ultimately runs the US government for profit is a bigger problem. Also this movie gave me a much better understanding of how the financial system works going back as far as when the first dollar was created, (I always thought the dollar was backed by gold or some other form of real value and not printed out of thin air). Also disturbing was the fact that debt was built into the system, debt which can NEVER be repaid. This financial system really is a well developed pyramid scheme and like all pyramid schemes it will ultimately fail.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Now i'm just going by what we are learning in government currently. <br>
<br>
The national debt can be repaid. We were in debt in the 80's then Clinton brought us out of the debt. I read that in every 10 dollars of tax money; one dollar is used to pay the debt. We were actually profiting from the tax money.<br>

I also don't believe that they print the money out of air to solve the problem. This results in even more inflation.<br>

Hehe, who knows what they are planning to do... it's very easy to fix a virtual-economy issue. But someone might be behind this, like first bank's fake bankrupt to profit others banks <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
About debt, my country and rest of South America is slaved by debt. As you just said, you can't repaid debt. Debt continue going bigger and bigger, it all started with British constructing docks and trains, and then they exploited all natural resources and gone with/out paying workers and government, but we are those who owes the money to them for bulding the abandoned docks and trains. While US began The Marshall Plan to rebuild Germany and the rest of Europe so later it would be their market (a very big demand for US products) by giving them credits with no interests, they gave us "credits" with a LOT of debt and interests. As the movie explains, only a few got profits about this "credits", not the total population of South America.<br>
<br>
Now probably you'll understand why does most of people hate the US and UK.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

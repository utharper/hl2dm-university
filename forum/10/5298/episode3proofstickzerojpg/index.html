	<div class="content">I also agree this proves EP3 is in the works. these entities do exist in AS's SDK. they are there since AS is built on a newer version of Source and taking advantage of new features (an early version of Source 2 i can only assume). I think EP3 is very real.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
Moreover, it was made by Valve very clear that Aperture Science and Black Mesa are rivaling companies. You can clearly see reference of Aperture in EP2 and of Black Mesa on Portal. In Portal, Chell (the figure you're playing as) is an employee in Aperture Science and the storyline hint heavily about a possible relation to her offsprings (probably Alyx, making Chell Eli's spouse.<br>
The Aperture Science logo is clearly shown on the video you see when you deliver the data stick to the Silo lab in EP2. ..and it goes on and on.<br>
The link seems a fact by now and the hints regarding a final connection and completion of the two storylines in either EP3 or Portal 2 (or both) seem inevitable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its already been reveled that Portal 2 takes place 100 years after the first one meaning whatever happened in Episode 3 is long gone by then. Perhaps we'll get something similar to what the portal update that added the transmission received achievement for episode 3, some images or audio files. Then again Valve could just stall even longer and include Episode 3 as the beginning of Half Life 3 if thats still even a possibility. <br>
<br>
One thing is for sure. I cant wait to see what goes on in Portal 2 beyond the amazing puzzles I've already seen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what could possibly be the difference between a new <em class="text-italics">episode</em> and a new <em class="text-italics">chapter</em> in the franchise? i think you're reading to much into the titles, while in fact, this is just more released content - title being episodes or new game with ...doh...episodes - it's still Freeman and etal. a new MP can sit on EP3 much as it would on a new full HL game. it doesn't matter at all. not to Valve and not to us.<br>
Going a few back, let me remind you Valve announced soon after the release of HL2 that it will no longer release full games in the series but focus on episodic releases, to quote them "so we can ship out new content in shorter time periods. instead of waiting 6-7 years for a game, you would wait 1-2 years for an episode". more or less these were the words.. .<br>
Two things we know for facts with Valve: <strong class="text-strong">1.</strong> they need to make economically driven decisions - so if something accumulates enough hype to becoming a hit then it's a good prospect. and <strong class="text-strong">2.</strong> they do what gives them pleasure - this is what sets them apart from other developers.<br>
<br>
BTW, i cannot honestly believe Valve "forgot" those EP3 entities in the AS SDK "by accident" and is now going "oh shit, now they'll be on to us". if you know anything about Valve, this is how they've been playing since forever. they love dropping you leads and hints everywhere. I once read an article about one of the writers at Valve explaining they never had any real clear storyline regarding who or what the G-man is for example. they fed off community theories and went with them. Gives you some insight on the creative process at Valve don't it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This coming from the company that stealthily integrated an ARG into portal by adding Morse and SSTV codes..  eventually leading to a BBS.<br>

Yeah you're implying Valve will rush out a Half Life game. <br>

If there IS a HL3 we wont see it until 2020. And everyone will LOVE it just as they loved all the other ones.  <br>

Again.. Implying.<br>
<br>
Valve has said that they never really had a story thought out. Any story that developed was influenced by fan speculation and Valve decided to go with it. <br>
<br>
I already know that the episodes are 'supposed' to be HL3.<br>
<br>
And its already been said that Portal 2 takes place 100 years after Portal. So by current standards there's at least 100 more years of story left untold.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

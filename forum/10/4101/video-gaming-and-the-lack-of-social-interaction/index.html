	<div class="content">If you are lazy enough as to not do a single sport activity in your freaking week i don't see why blaming videogames.<br>
You can play lots of hours a day while only doing an hour of exercise 5 times a week and you will probably be in decently good health conditions.<br>
Besides, I don't see why social interaction MUST be face to face.<br>
I have managed to make lots of good friends online, lol'd with them, trust in them, etc, same as I would do with any other person IRL.<br>
Like for example, I played tf2 for about 8 months, did some great friends, and now when I moved to study to the capital of my country, we did a tf2 meeting, got to know each other in person and I still hang out with some of them on the weekends.<br>
Besides, many researchs have shown several gaming benefits :&gt;</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

uhmm, I'm not sure if you get what you mean.<br>
If I'm not mistaken, you "make" friends instead of "doing" them right? Do would have a sexual connotation. If so, damn, didn't realize that before posting, remember I still learn English day by day, I may make some mistakes here and there =(

<br>
To combat it, name any hobby you can think of that is not considered physical activity.  Reading for one lol.<br>
  But another thing i wonder about, is how they come up with these stats I know I have been considered 'fat' simply because of my height to weight.  These stats don't considered my fat percentage which is 10-14%.  Every NFL player would be considered morbidly obese or any other professional athlete.<br>
<br>
lol according to this thing I am 'obese'  6'1 - 230lbs<br>
<a href="http://www.laparoscopy.com/pleatman/am-i-morbidly-obese.htm" class="postlink">http://www.laparoscopy.com/pleatman/am- ... -obese.htm</a><br>
But these charts are severely failed as they do not consider muscle weight what so ever.<br>
For the winter I work out 5 times a week of very intense work outs.  Only way I am gonna be 'healthy' according to this chart is by starving myself.  Only people that will be considered healthy on these charts are athletes that actively cut weight or people that are very skinny with no muscle mass.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is why I know my fat %,  but as this says <blockquote class="uncited"><div>. Today 97 million Americans, more than one-third of the adult population, are overweight or obese. An estimated 5 to 10 million<br>
of those are considered morbidly obese. </div></blockquote>

I am sure that I and all of the NFL, NBA, MLB are all part of that 97 million number.  Since no one has come to test my Fat % but they could find my weight and height.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its just funny because my girlfriend considers any type of gaming bad because there is a lack of social face to face interaction, generally your sitting on your butt, etc. People should go outside and socialize and be with people in her eyes. Yet she openly admits to loving Super Mario Brothers and Rockband, and even though she plays them when she can get her hands on them, she still curses gaming. Then again shes a very active athlete and has a major in Psychology so that mess could have seeped in her head. But then one could argue that her drinking habits are bad, but then she could argue that she is socializing with people through her partying and that's good. Its just a never ending cycle. I am actively getting more into becoming a distance runner and maybe doing triathlons one day, but I still keep gaming as a past time. As she says, everyone has their vice... For most athletes apparently its drinking. For me, its gaming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have been collecting unemployment since Feburary 2008. (thanks to michigan being one of the worst states to find a job, I got 2 13 week extensions, so I just stayed home and raised the kid and started college since that was free cuz Im labeled poor with a kid)  The free $ ended this month however.  <br>
<br>
I've always had phsyically demanding jobs, and I spent years playing soccer competitvely, meaning practices 2-3 times a week, not your bullshit city recreational crap.  I can honestly say I have been rather inactive since I've been laid off.  I have gained 9 lbs in over a year of inactivity.  <br>
<br>
I eat one meal a day.  Dinner.  (When I work, its the full 3 meal deal, I got a high metabolism) I stretch continusouly throughout the day, just to keep shit relaxed.  Am I healthy?  doubtful.  Im sure my cholestrol is rather high.  5'10"  @ 171 lbs at the moment.  I do not play soccer any longer, havent in roughly 3 years, the most exercise I've been getting is riding bikes with my son, minimal exercises at home when I get bored, and not eating fast food.  I still got the flat stomach and man boobs of muscle.  Just lacking the endurance now due to laziness.<br>

Perhaps, but I was 5'10 and weighed 130 and had "lots of muscle" at his age. It's simply a matter of having 0 body fat thanks to sports. Fast forward to 16 years later, now Im considered overweight and weigh 177. I would have to agree, but I look alot healthier.

	<div class="content">well my grand master once said "too much of one thing is usually a bad thing" so guess it how much of it takes over your life. I my self try and balance how much I play I have notice thro the years it does effect me mentally and it some cases in the past I lost focus on more important things in life. I say right now its just about right I do play but do try and get out often or do creative work and learn new skills from tutorials. But I seen first hand gaming take over peeps life I even read news stories of one member of a couple get so involved in WOW that their is hardly any time they spend with their partner or even kids in some cases. I knew a guy that used play this game he was in his 30s and from what I understand his life was a mess been divorced and has a kid he not seen for years. It got to a point where I frankly told the guy to quti the game and sort his life. <br>

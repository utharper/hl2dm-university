Yes I mean a second tournament. <br>
<br>
And by this "A few things that wont happen next season:<br>
<br>
Double elimination."<br>
<br>
I mean, it will be another single elimination tournament.<br>

Airfusion will be shown some lovin for sure.<br>
<br>
The bouncing around from cameras is to try to get most of the action on what the casters are saying at the time but we will try to be more aware of that for next season.<br>
And as panic said, you cannot stream in fullscreen.<br>
<br>
As for resolution it is all based on your internet connection and how high it can preform without getting choppy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I am sure a pick-map-pool method could be made to work. I believe in you.<br>
It would be best for their to be an actual "season" before and type of single elimination tournament. <br>
<br>
Even though you're rolling your eye's at this point, please read my reasoning. <br>
<br>
Mediocre teams hate the one-and-done model. <br>
It's why Val puss'd out of playing and why I had to get a forfeit win in the semi-final round of the last tournament. A real season and/or and double elimination playoff-seeded tournament at the end gives more teams more opportunities to play. Yes, this has been done before and your personal experience with it has been a lot of inactivity and dispute BS, but it allows more teams to play more matches and (in theory) have more fun. Furthermore, a map pool is just the fairest way to play; no more whiny Grain bitching about slotted maps. It is the ONLY way a 1v1 league as ever been done and could be done, so why can it not be applied to teamplay? <br>
<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5818&amp;start=0&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;hilit=pick+map+pool" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... k+map+pool</a> <br>
I explain the fuck out of my idea in that thread, and I am telling you that giving teams more control of their matches makes them feel more comfortable with playing. What eFPS needs that CU never had was a league mandated pool of maps so that I don't have to play some gay shit map billy made or something. A good league is one that properly balances the freedom-to-play as well as the structures necessary to uphold the rules and fair-play. Hl2dm is obviously small scale, so this could work. Much like when companies investing in alternative fuels and transportation use Iceland to "test" their ideas before marketing them to larger scale markets like New York or LA, you could test this theory on the small community of hl2dm; then if you feel it is successful, you could apply it to other games so that your "coding" is the same across the board. That is your main issue, yes? Deviating from the simple site code of a single elimination tournament?  <br>
<br>
Edge and I have done some testing. In addition to the issues people have with ag2 in stock mode (footsteps and spawns and whatnot), there has now been a potentially game breaking glitch discovered that I must disclose to Janek. The coder is willing to cater to use but needs time. Perhaps we could test these new ideas on a 1v1 league only then have teamplay added when a 1.03 patch is released. <br>
<br>
Please do not rush into another mediocre teamplay tournament. <br>
Please be open to my ideas, and when are you going to send me a new version of that one map we tested? <br>
<br>
Have a little faith. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Nutri-Grain wrote:</cite>So many things to say.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">1v1 Tournament:</em><br>
1) Having a single-elimination 1v1 tournament is the worst idea ever. I get it if you don't want to do double-e for 2v2 and/or 3v3 league play, but in a 1v1 league, it is a must. I don't think I need to explain why, but I guess I will since people are stupid. In a 1v1 league there are many more matches being played than in 2v2 and 3v3. This is mostly due to the fact that those 2v2 and 3v3 teams will probably all want to play in the 1v1 league as well, but it is also because some people just prefer 1v1ing in HL2DM (eg: fucking Bahlk). Even if the 1v1 tournament only ended up having 15 to 20 brave souls, double-elimination is necessary to keep that tournament exciting and interesting. One mediocre player gets paired up against one of the 5 top-tier players that still play and their 1v1 tournament is over after a total of 20 minutes of play-time. However, if the loser is able to practice and prepare for a second chance at eFPS glory, which we all know consists of a Dallas hat, the whole tournament will benefit. Matches will be more exciting--who doesn't like a good comeback story? Dallas? Use your brain. <br>
<br>
2) The structure of the 1v1 tournament should be something like this:<br>
- Player One picks a map of his or her (lol, her) choice from the 1v1 map-list that has been voted and agreed upon by the members of the community <strong class="text-strong">THAT ARE PLAYING IN THE TOURNAMENT</strong>. The reason I have to make that last bit of information obvious is because I don't want to be playing a map in eFPS because people like Impala voted for it. No offense, Impala. <br>
- Player Two then does the same.<br>
- In a 1v1, a win is a win. The winning-or-losing-by-points system should not be implemented in a 1v1 setting. The reason for this is because anyone has the ability to be incredibly good at one specific map, and if they can pick that map and win by 30 in the first round, the other player will most likely not have a chance to make a comeback in the second round. An example here would be Blas picking LD against someone like myself or Panic, or me picking aim_arena against anyone lolololol.<br>
- All tiebreaker maps should be randomly selected from the 1v1 map-list before the tournament even begins. There should be a new tiebreaker map for each week.<br>
<br>
3) Although I am a fan of not using the maps from the last tournament in this next tournament, I think that Lostarena should be used in 1v1. It is one of the best 1v1 maps around, and not having it in the tournament would be a shame.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Other thoughts:</em><br>
1) I get that you don't like things getting out of hand, Dallas, but I think that members of the community that are willing to support this game by playing in eFPS leagues should be able to have some say about how some of the details of the tournaments. There should be a separate map-pool for each tournament (1v1, 2v2, and 3v3), and that map-pool should be decided upon by listening to the suggestions of others and holding a vote. You like keeping things in line, Dallas, but I personally do not like the feeling of being part of a HL2DM dictatorship ruled by the almighty BadBoy(z).<br>
<br>
2) Everyone knows that New Guy had the best shout-casts. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'll post my map suggestions later when I have had some time to think about them, because I know that everyone cares.</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">Honestly, I did consider it grain, but the site took me 6 months to code and release, and with school starting back up I really dont have any more time to code an entire new section to the website.<br>
<br>
I did consider creating two different tournament brackets and using one of them for an upper and lower bracket, but that wont really work the way I want it to work.<br>
<br>
Maybe we could do something like have an open bracket and an invite bracket for lower and higher seeded players, but that will depend on the turnout of players wanting to play.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming you guys are leaning towards a 1v1 tourney next from the responses. <br>
<br>
As for having a map pool to choose from though, this may be something I can implement.<br>
<br>
I will check into it next weekend when I get some more time.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps guys.<br>

	<div class="content">Well im gonna have to say that I agree 100% with Grain's post.<br>
<br>
Map Pool Voting would be a nice thing to incorporate.<br>
<br>
1v1 tourney with a loser's bracket would be overall a much better experience. Lets say I decide to play 1v1, and for round 1 I get put up against someone really good like Blas. I am a lousy 1v1 player so then my chances are over. With a loser's bracket then at least I could play other players who have lost as well and perhaps come in at a higher place, have more fun, and get more practice!<br>
<br>
Also say for example round 1 is Edge vs. Constipator. Either player is very skilled and has a high chance of winning the whole thing. That would suck if say Con won by a few lucky frags and then Edge has to wait till next season. He could instead battle it out in the loser's bracket and still end up winning the whole tourney. (I hope you guys don't mind me using you for examples, I think your great players and have lots of respect.)<br>
<br>
Also we can't expect everything out of Da1 immediately, after all he is only 1 person. Perhaps eFPS can work towards these ideas. [=</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

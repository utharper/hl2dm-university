	<div class="content">Since the economy is down, my dad's job isn't doing too well. They are doing some cuts so in return, that means some cuts for the family too. This isn't a "I'm quitting" post. It's a "I'll be on absent leave" post. <br>
<br>
So my parents decided to cut the internet and tv. The TV isn't too big of a deal. It's the internet of course. I'm not sure how long I'll be gone or how 100% this is going to happen, but I'd also like some advice. <br>
<br>
I just bought my computer this summer. <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=2140" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... f=6&amp;t=2140</a><br>
<br>
I worked the entire summer to get it and now that I'll have no internet, I feel that it may be worthless. I'm debating on whether to sell it or not. If you are too lazy to look at the specs, here they are: <br>
<br>
Link Depot 4Pack 80mm Case Fan-----------------------------------------------------$3.99<br>
EVGA GeForce 8800GTS 640MB-----------------------------------------------------$159.99<br>
Evercool 95mm Ever Lubricate CPU Cooler---------------------------------------------$7.99<br>
Bytecc 42-1 USB Card Reader--------------------------------------------------------$9.99<br>
Intel BOXDGG31PR LGA 775 Motherboard---------------------------------------------$64.99<br>
Hitachi Deskstar 7200 RPM SATA 320 GB Hard drive-----------------------------------$59.99<br>
Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 2.4GHz Processor-----------------------------------------$179.99<br>
Tricod 8068 Black Steel ATX Mid Tower Computer Case 450W Power Supply-----------$39.99<br>
Corsair 4GB DDR2 Memory----------------------$87.00 with 20 dollar mail in rebate--- $67.00<br>
Hanns-G Black 19" 5ms LCD Monitor------------------------------------------------$159.99<br>
Microsoft Windows XP Home with SP2b for system builders----------------------------$84.99<br>
hec HP585D 585W ATX12V Power Supply - No Power Cord - OEM---------------------$23.99<br>
First Gen Logitech G15 Keyboard---------------------------------------------------$??.??<br>
Logitech MX518 Mouse------------------------------------------------------------$30.00(?)<br>
ALTEC LANSING BXR1121 15 Watts 2.1 3 piece music and gaming speaker system------- $29.99<br>
<br>
How much can I get for it? Should I sell it etc. Also, I have a 120GB iPod Video 3rd gen which will also be worthless if I don't have a computer or a way to download music. Should I sell that too?<br>
<br>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Those are awesome ideas. I'm 18 though so I don't know how well that'd work. Plus, doesn't bouncing require fighting? I'm not too big into that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

if EE were just a "clan" that would be true.  i owe you no explanation of how tight the EE family is.  further, the purpose of that tattoo is to show my devotion to my loved ones, a sentiment that will be bestowed exponentally on to my daughter.  i started this thread to show this community, which i have become extremely close with over the years, my beautiful new born daughter.  why you chose to troll it is beyond me.  i was going to have ghost delete your posts but i think having them there is a good way to show us how pathetic and meaningless your existance is.   man up, appologize, and move on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Get used to the lack of sleep, even after almost 2 years my boy still likes to get me up at least twice a night and more!  I think in all that time he may have had 2 nights where he didn't wake up at some point, then I woke up in fear there was something wrong with him, but he was fine!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

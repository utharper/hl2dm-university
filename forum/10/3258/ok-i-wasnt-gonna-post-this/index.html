She and her family are lucky you are around to support and help out during this time!<br>

I will keep her in my thoughts and wish you and your family the best as you go through this. I know it seems terrible and risky to think that someone so small will have to go surgeries like that, but the doctors and technology are really good today and I'm sure all will go well. <br>
My niece was born with 2 defective heart valves and 5 holes in her heart and was basically kept alive for 6 months until she was strong enough at 6 months old to undergo open heart surgery. Today she is 2 and is doing great, the doctors expect her to lead a normal life now.<br>
Wishing her the best of care,<br>

I read your first post and it really hit me hard.  It's always difficult to see an innocent child go through such things!  My fiance' and I experienced a miscarriage a couple years ago and she is pregnant again, we were worried about having problems all over again but so far everything is looking great.  She will be 14 weeks this Friday.  We had another ultra sound today and the baby was lively as could be, moving around like crazy, almost appeared to smile and wave to the "camera".  It brought tears to my eyes, it's quite a feeling to see that.  Rest assured we will all be praying for your niece and know God will be watching over her!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">K in in long sense Clans united is having a national team cup. Where players join national squads and compete to prove which nation is the best at hl2dm. For example I would be part of team UK also know as you-k. Look at the link.<br>
<br>
Also on having Americans playing or none european playing in the nation cup seemed unpractical I for one wanted you guys to play but looking at past games I have had and other in europe it would be very hard even some russian clans have trouble arranging wars with players from the uk and usually there allways a problem. Plus the time diffrence.<br>
<br>
But I got a good idea  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">. At the end you guys select the best players you can for a american team and they could play the winners of the European nations cup. Im sure many would like to see that. Should not be a problems to arrange that one match.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This site is about HL2DM. This post is about Hl2DM.<br>
<br>
Even tho it's sad to be unable to compete it might interest alot of people to see how matches are played in europe, watching demos or even watching live STV. <br>
<br>
Believe me, you don't wanna play in a league that has time difference, high ping and friendly fire all at once  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's actually not true CU wouldn't allow Americans to play in the regular league it's just they don't state that anywhere because it makes them look bad. Some admins disagree with not allowing Americans play including me and I'm sure SND, but I imagine if any American team applied they would be rejected. :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah like trash said I did not have a problem with it you guys playing. But I fully understand why it would not work if it was allowed thing is CU is not like CAL it pretty much all supported by the players them selfs most of CU admins give up allot of time including me to ensure it runs smoothly which is a god damn hard thing to do btw and we will be running the 3v3 2v2 and also 1v1 daily cups so we got allot on our plate and don't know how we could resolve disputes across the pond with time we have. <br>
<br>
We try and get all games played and in NC we would love to have u guys compete but we got think about players that play in our league allready have and possible probelms we would get. One problem is ping you may be able to play against guys in the uk or as far as germany but you will have a big problem playing against russian plays ect. Then time diffrence now if you ever played in cu you would know how much of a problem it can be to agree a date and time to play and df occur because of it some of us just don't have the time to wait for US player to come back from work by that time we migt need to go to bed some of us work really early.<br>
<br>
Now I did put out a challage for u guys to get a team together to play against the winner of the european nations cup which would be just great you could even start up your own NC cup down your end to find the best team.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Fearsom you made my point we don't have a organsation like CAL behind us to surport us and we are not a big league with a good stronge structure in place. What makes u think we will be able to handle dealing with our local players and US.<br>
plus<br>
im right about the time gap your 6 hrs behind to the uk 7 hours to the middle of europe and 8 with other countries that play in our league if im right (may be wrong this is off the top of my head). <br>
<br>
If u guys still don't like it then why don't you start your own NC where not stopping you we actually incourage it.<br>
<br>
As i said i would really like to see nc running at your end and ours and get winners of them to play each other at the end but thats up to you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

it failed every time.  Maybe we could hold a draft and have the winner play you guys.... but it'd be soo earlier by time we finish for us and you guys.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well emm let me think.<br>
<br>
well what you could do is run the drafts for 6 or 7 weeks leading up to the finals at your end while over here we get the cup rounds played then you just select 3-6 players to represent your continent to play against the winner in the euro cup. If you can get a really good team together then we can get a epic 3v3 game played.<br>
<br>
Most likely it would be like how CU game structure but we would put ff off for you guys since you might have the communcation if your players don't know each other well. As well it would be like this play one game on US server home team play combine to make up for the lag and one game on a euro server with home team combine. You can select any dm map for homemap but it has to be suitable for 3v3. winner decided by CU point system.<br>
<br>
let me know if your up for the challenge.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

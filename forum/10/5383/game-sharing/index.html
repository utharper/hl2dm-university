I used to use my account in offline mode on 3-4 computers before all my "cheap" friends bought CSS...<br>
It does work, however with the constant updates for games like tf2, css, ect, it would only last for a short time...<br>
Of course they wouldn't be able to play online, only LAN/single player.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've done something similar before, I bought a game I ended up not wanting to play very much, a friend wanted to play it REALLY bad, I bought it through steam, but it was mainly a windows live game. We did some bargaining (and I trust him, normally I would NOT do this with just anyone) and he used a pirated copy on his end and I gave him the key that came with the game when I got it through steam.

	<div class="content">I bought UT2004 through Steam, and dl'ed it on a few computers, then replaced the .exe with one from the non-steam version and was able to use it without steam on several computers.<br>
We play a lot of LAN, so didn't try it online or anything...<br>
<br>
And the CSS thing as i mentioned earlier was through steam, just in offline mode...<br>
Only lame thing now is your names would be Viperbird, Viperbird(2), Viperbird(3) ect..<br>
<br>
As far as Genocide using windows live games, I don't think that would have been through steam.<br>
<br>
Nothing of the sort works with sc2, so now all my tightwad friends have to actually buy the game  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">From wat i gathered this is wat they meant, and if it is then no u cannot get banned and ur steam client wont even be accessing the internet. Then wen ur done u login to ur own account.<br>
<br>
Step1 - Sign into friends account.<br>
Step2 - Install game then open it(close right away).<br>
Step3 - Go offline mode with steam (still on ur friends account).<br>
Step4 - Play game<br>
<br>
This will not interfere with ur friend either since u are offline its just a matter of trusting with passwords. The above assumes u are talking about a game that u download through steam etc.<br>
Maybe u should look into a way of having 2 steam clients installed so u can keep 1 permenantly in offline mode. /shrugs</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You can only use your "key" for a particular game on one account, weather that be steam, battle.net, ect...<br>
2 instances of your account cannot be run online on 2 different computers or more.<br>
Your account can be run in offline mode on a infinite number of computers in theory.<br>
If the game supports LAN play, you and all your buddies can play off of 1 single account, in offline mode. <br>
If the game doesn't support LAN play (i.e. SC2) everyone playing will have to have a purchased copy<br>
However, if a friend wants to login to their account, the "stored password/offline mode ready" for steam on your account will be lost.<br>

Tell your friend to try this:<br>
<br>
Go to a torrent site, and download fallout 3 torrent, he can even get the game of the year edition. When he stops being cheap (cuz its a damn long and good game) he can buy it.<br>
Now ur safe, and he can play his game. xD <br>
<br>
Most likely he will need a windows live account and he will need to play fallout 3 in offline mode to play it. Just like with Street Fighter 4. Hope this helps!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

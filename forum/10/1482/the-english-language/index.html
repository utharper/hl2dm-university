Well, Brazil is part of South America, that IS true. Like the typical arrogant American, i was talking about the English being subverted by the internet. I didn't intend a politically correct discussion of national languages.<br>
<br>
Also, BI, English IS the national language. It isn't (but should be) the OFFICIAL language of the USA.<br>
English is used on our currency and in all official documents and is in fact, national language, whether the FED recognizes or not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is what i was getting at.<br>
Paradox also wrote about reverting to IP talk in official business communications, something that i have had to edit myself.<br>
<br>
In a way, IP talk (so to speak) condenses meaning to simpler icons or objects.<br>
There is good and bad in this.<br>
Language actually is intended to describe the objective world in a meaningful and understandable way. Language SHOULD be expansive. While the English language expands, IP Talk shrinks.<br>

<br>
People have become so addicted to seeing cat pictures and putting stupid 'cat language' text over their respective activity in the image that they are starting to incorporate it into their own language.  <br>
<br>
This isn't to say that it's all bad..  I think we can all agree that the acronym 'Lol' is a universal response in that when you don't really want to throw out some feedback, you and they both know that the exchange of 'lol' finishes it fine, it tells them that you're satisfied, and when you look at how basic human responses tend, you see that people love satisfaction, isn't it the greatest thing ever when you say something clever and people think about it and laugh?  They're the ones that actually make YOU feel satisfied, from being satisfied in the first place.<br>

Maybe hate was the wrong word to use?  See what I mean?  This is why I hate the language <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  My vocabulary itself slows down progress..  I'm working on that though <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
I accept how great the language is, but there's something about it that seems like a distraction..  The only way people can communicate is through metaphor and identification, both of which are a tease..  <br>
<br>
"I saw a big light in the sky and off to the sides of this light were huge bright spiralling jets of what looked like plasma 'hair"<br>
<br>
It's the only method we have besides actually filming the experience, but you know imagining that is nothing like the experience of being there and seeing it for yourself (even though visual interpretation isn't 100% accurate as well), so I accept that language is needed in order to progress, but like this thread says, language is so slow, I thought it was still slow even before Catz came and conquered.<br>
<br>
The word 'Hate' is NOTHING without other words to support it, so what is Hate without using words?  The only way you can understand something is if one person is extremely careful about what he/she writes, and another person is real careful about what he/she reads, other wise it's both enigmatic and rather useless..  <br>
<br>
So I don't hate the language, I just lack the vocabulary to describe that 'negative feeling' I have for the language <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>

Here is something else to consider.<br>
<br>
In the first post, i am asking a question designed to elicit thought and reaction.<br>
So many times, this process, on the internet, is misconstrued.<br>
<br>
I was not making a statement of fact. My answer is maybe.<br>
Does the shortened bastardized English used on the internet have more meaning or less?</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">Yeah it is, but it is no different then any generation before. A language evolves it seems the youth wanting to be different always force that to happen. This generation is the internet generation. In the future though with increased bandwidth and computing power it is most likely we will no longer need to type. One of the main things that stops voice recognition from moving forward is that in offices or any environment with multiple people everyone yapping to their computer will get out of control. But look at OCZ and other companies coming out with head bands that monitor brain waves and control computer input. In 10 years or less we will all be inputing most of our computer  interaction silently with these types of devices. It will be nice as it will solve the whole carpel tunnel syndrome pandemic =]. But the very nature of these devices may drive another wave of change in the English language. Another major change will be translation software with may take longer but it will get to the point where all the time people spent learning English will be wasted as they will be able to just have everything translated instantly. <br>
<br>
Anyhow look at it this way, you can talk to some young kid with bad communication who is saying roffle and lulz, or you can talk to another kid saying sup dawg and whatever else they say. Education and acceptable speech in the real world will always keep the language in check though. Every generation will have an issue like this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I must admit though when I'm outside looking at things I tend to use alot of what I see in computers, car crash, someone lagged out and the other person didn't see the hitreg right, walk in and your gal is on top of another man, "omfg, wtf?  gtfo, GTFO"  &lt;  All of these, I'm sure have originiated from real situations on the outside <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

Umm, The English language contains more than raped imperialist seized  chards of destroyed native languages.<br>
You apply the usual politically correct subjective quality that barely scratches the surface of a truth.<br>
English has co-opted words from other languages.<br>
English is still English.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

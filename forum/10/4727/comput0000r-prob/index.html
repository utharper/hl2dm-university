	<div class="content">Curious if any of u guys went thru something like im going through right now, the game has been slowing down, models and physics wise, its like if you you played HL2DM on with a strobelight effect, the models only appear at intervals and thus I'm often shooting at nothing. I dont think I have any viruses, you guys think my GPU is going bad?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Do you notice the slow down in just games or in other applications as well?<br>

	<div class="content">Mods can lock the thread, it was a combination of having my rate set at 2500 (forgot a zero), really dumb mistake and having my cmd rates at 66 when they are supposed to be at 100 for my internet connection....If I had to guess having my rate at 2500 instead of 30000 is what made the massive slide show effect for me</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I will assume that is sarcasm -.-<br>
But yes the negative acceleration is a known problem ppl are bitching about, and btw, negative acceleration is wen ...the faster u move ur mouse the less it movesu around, but slower movements are normal.. ie u move ur mouse slowly 30cm it turns 360degree lets say, but if u do it fast it turns like 40degrees. A real bitch to play with.<br>
There is one way to avoid the acceleration, turn x and y sense up to 100. But then u have to turn ur mouse dpi way down (mine is on 100 for JC2) and its really pixelated aiming.<br>
<br>
Its a good game, they fix that crap and it will be much more fun for sure.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ladies and Gents,<br>
<br>
I currently own an ATI X1300 video card, PCI Express x16.  For some time now my system has been crashing whilst playing DM with the traditional looping sound then back to desktop with error.  90% of the time when it crashes back to desktop it will be completely pixelated to where I can't make out any of my desktop icons, then after a few seconds it goes back to normal.  Sometimes in game my health and armor count will turn all pixely to where I can't make out what it says - ammo count will do the same, then eventually it crashes.  I'm starting to wonder if I have a video card problem!  Or could it be the game itself is causing it?  I'm assuming it's video related at this point.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions as to a good replacement card?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Been there done that, updated drivers, reloaded drivers you name it I've tried it.  I just re-installed my OS, Steam, HL2...the whole works and I continue to have the problems.  I'm hearing the 4850 runs very hot!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks guys, I appreciate the feedback.  Are you all in agreement that I may have a video card problem or do you suspect it's a typical Valve/Steam/HL2DM bug?<br>
<br>
Also, who's a trustworthy manufacturer of the Nvidia cards?  EVGA, XFX, ZOTAC...etc..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Got it at a decent price at the time, too. I'm sure you'll get a better deal on it now.<br>

That card runs everything I throw at it and right now my only limitation is my CPU which isn't dual core. =/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks ninja and holy!!  I do all my computer shopping at Newegg, I'll look into these cards further.  Once again last night I was playing then all of a sudden my health and armor count changed to a bunch of random pixels.  Then I shot an orb and I couldn't even see it, only hear it.  So then I shot another orb and caught it right away with my ggun and it was just a black box instead of an orb!!!!  Never had this happen before!  About 5 seconds after that the game crashed!  Things are getting worse.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

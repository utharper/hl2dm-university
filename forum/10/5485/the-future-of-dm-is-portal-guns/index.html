	<div class="content">"Throw a toilet at your friend" <br>
<br>
These are the words any pr0 dm player (I wouldn't know) loves whispered into their ear as they drift to sleep after six days of gaming and amphetamine pills. Our beloved selling point, which I love to repeat over and over to complete strangers in the hopes of making a friend will soon be gone, replaced with<br>
<br>
"Throw a toilet at your friend through a portal"  <br>
<br>
I think this is inevitable seeing as Portal 2 is leaning toward a multiplayer aspect with co op, but will not have a multiplayer aspect in its own right. It's stupid just to speculate, but I think it's an avenue that Valve must be working on. Think of it this way, if Valve doesn't, now that DM os on the new engine, someone else will. <br>
<br>
So where would that leave the game? Would a portal gun really even be a viable alternative to say, the GG, or could they be used together? Would it fail like someone simply maging your dumbass as you hop through portal to portal in plain view? Could be interesting.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

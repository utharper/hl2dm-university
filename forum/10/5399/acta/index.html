	<div class="content">ACTA is something that the Bush administration started pushing for in 2006. It's a treaty that nations can sign on to (they don't have to) that will set up standard international laws governing intellectual property (like file-sharing music and movies). <br>
<br>
One of the problems that US media companies are running into is that its very difficult to prosecute international file-sharers because US laws don't always correspond with foreign laws on the subject of intellectual property. So the treaty is an attempt to make international laws about intellectual property that the treaty-signing nations can use to prosecute file-sharing infringement.<br>
<br>
It's still being negotiated and hasn't been enacted by any countries yet. It's controversial because the negotiations and potential drafts of the treaty have been kept super-secret. It's highly unusual to have a treaty like this be completely hidden from the public. We'll see it eventually, though, if the negotiations are successful and the treaty comes before Congress to sign it. In my opinion, its just the MPAA and the RIAA putting their lobbying dollars to work.<br>
<br>
Even if it passes, what difference will it have, practically speaking? The Pirate Bay and other major file-sharing ISP's are in nations that don't sign treaties like these, and who are opposed to this kind of attempt to stop file-sharing. So who knows. We'll have to wait and see.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Essentially to be more specific then Holy ACTA is an executive agreement that was begun under the Bush administration, specifically birthed in Japan by extreme pressure from Sony Corp. and RIAA. Under the Obama admin negotiotians have stalled for the time being, with several countries including the U.S. delaying specifics and in general keeping it secret.<br>
<br>
Essentially under an executive agreement it is an informal treaty that depends on the President who crafts it, one day the executive agreement can dissapear, one day it could enforced to its full scripture, and one day it could be enacted and just completely *non-enforced* depending on the President. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Be aware that both executive agreements and treaties automatically override the U.S. Constitution.</span></strong><br>
<br>
The important thing to watch is how ACTA defines the act of "ripping", as the negotiations stand now the general act of "ripping" is being veraciously and liberally defined by pressure from RIAA. Ripping which could become internationally illegal means even the transferring music to ipod can be classified as "ripping" as RIAA currently defines it and is pressuring ACTA negotiators to define it as. Right now though the biggest laws being crafted in ACTA of course are in the direction of ISP's, putting extreme pressure on them to restrict torrenters and the like. Will ACTA be finished under the Obama admin? Probably not in his first term, if he wins in second term he could just continue to delay like he is now and shove it to a President more willing to engage in ACTA.<br>
<br>
<br>
One more thing; treaties in general are subject to the discretion of locality law more then anything (as in city governments) and even if this ridiculous treaty is passed it is unlikely you will see localities enforce this garbage in general to its full extent.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Once again you make me do face furls instead of facerolls. <br>
<br>
Treaties do override the U.S. Constitution unless the court systems say the treaty is unconstitutional, but so far no treaty in the history of the United States has been ruled unconstitutional, so the basis of my judgement is empiricle and quantitative instead of qualitative. It is similar in the way a federal act passed by Congress can nullify parts of the Constitution, it then becomes the Supreme Courts responsibility to determine whether the federal act or treaty is out of the bounds of the Constitution.<br>
<br>
So if a treaty was passed today banning firearms, it would in fact supersede the Constitution until the courts rule otherwise.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

False. Absolutely false. Both executive agreements and treaties are subject to review by the Supreme Court just like any other legislative act or agency rule. The Supreme Court has unfettered jurisdiction to declare both treaties and executive orders unconstitutional. <br>
<br>
"This [Supreme] Court has regularly and uniformly recognized the supremacy of the Constitution over a treaty." <em class="text-italics">Reid v. Covert</em>, 354 U.S. 1, 17 (1957).<br>
<br>
No act by Congress or order by the president can ever "override" the Constitution. Even if Congress or the Executive Branch passes a law or makes an order you think is "unconstitutional," unless the Supreme Court agrees, you're wrong.<br>
<br>
See also <em class="text-italics">Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</em>, 343 U.S. 579 (1952). "The President's power, if any, to issue executive orders must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Let's take the orders of proceedings.<br>
<br>
Treaty is signed by President.<br>
<br>
Treaty goes into law, treaty has same weight as a federal statute, treaty/statute are the supreme law of the land until the Court reviews it. <br>
<br>
Treaty is reviewed by the Court<br>
<br>
Treaty overturned/ruled unconstitutional which has yet to happen in history, prove me wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Court reviews a law already <em class="text-italics">there</em>. The purpose of my argument is to demonstrate a treaty has a similar weight of value toward the Constitution as a federal statute does. The other point is to show that if ACTA is worded vaguely enough, it could bypass strict judicial review and become murky in the areas of privacy of property. Technically a treaty clearly violating the U.S. Constitution if never challenged in court could remain law, and thus overrides the Constitution <em class="text-italics">for a time</em> until judicial review is finally done.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I might need someone to translate this into a language that I understand. But if I'm getting you right, you're arguing two things<br>
<br>
a) Because the Supreme Court reviews legislative actions retrospectively and not prospectively, treaties are valid before they become invalid<br>
<br>
b) The Supreme Court has never ruled a treaty unconstitutional and so it won't rule that way on ACTA<br>
<br>
Your first argument is silly. Every legislative and executive action is subject to judicial review. Just because the Judiciary reviews actions instead of previewing those actions doesn't mean that laws were valid and then became invalid when ruled unconstitutional. Actions ruled unconstitutional are retroactively voided, as though they carried no authority <em class="text-italics">ab initio</em>.<br>
<br>
Your second argument made one of my eyes raise higher than the other and I furrowed my brow. Because it's silly. The Supreme Court has affirmed again and again that they have the right to void a treaty. Just because they haven't used it does not mean that they will not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Is it silly? Do you know that there are federal acts that have never been challenged in any federal court in our history? What if that act is unconstitutional but no one has brought suit for the courts to review? My point is a technicality to demonstrate a broader point you seem to missing but it is as simple as this.<br>
<br>
If a treaty bans firearms (all forms) and is signed tomorrow and no one challenges it, it remains supreme law of the land regardless of whether it is constitutional or not because it is not available for judicial review because no one has brought suit to it. All the technicality aside is the broader point that executive agreements and treaties are typically avoided by the courts in so order not to touch the dangerous realm of international law binding to ourselves. Because no treaties have been formally challenged by the Supreme Court, it is reasonable to assume that if ACTA is passed that it too would be likely avoided by the Court, and if its text is vague enough could hold itself against the litmus test of the court. That is the broader concern of ACTA, not all this technical bullshit. The other concern is that this is an executive agreement, even more vague and disturbing trend then treaties.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It will likely pass in a decade.<br>
<br>
What will it mean for you? If RIAA gets its ways any act of "ripping" PERIOD will become illegal. ISP's will be intensely pressured to crack down on major seeders, and will be pressured to cut service if you found to be downloading illegally. ACTA can pave the way for the RIAA and NSA to partner into making "super-spyware" to check whether or not you are doing this, RIAA is actually in the process of lobbying the FBI and NSA to make these programs in partnership as we speak. <br>
<br>
The effectiveness of ACTA will depend on the President, he may or may not direct federal enforcement agencies to pursue and prosecute ACTA violations. Vote in a President who you think will be less likely to direct its agencies to do as such is my only advice if you want to stop it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It cannot be withheld because this shit will never ever pass.<br>
Let me explain what this really means is in simple terms - some very bad men want to own and control you - they make up a facade international board and try to enforce rules that will restrict and control commerce and e-commerce throughout the whole world by all means possible. it means if now only half of your ass is owned by the government; once this goes live your entire ass is government property and we will all walk around inside a jail with no fences as big as the planet. no internet. no free media. you don't own your credit card, your bank account, your paid for house, car and so on. fuck iPods. this is far greater than busting kids on borders searching for illegal MP3s or w/e. this is in effect an attempt to create a single government that is an overlord above all laws and countries. and what a sad attempt.<br>
<br>
@ Valiums - do you really believe this is about cracks? do you not see how this is the ground to a much larger idea? think for a minute what REALLY happens once this pass. What happens to the laws that now protect you, your freedom and your possessions? You honestly believe a law that allows governments full unwarranted searches into people's belongings and personal computers is really all about cracks? HA! even if it were that it could easily be used as ground for unspeakable crimes against humanity now made lawful.<br>
Another thing - the notion of a "super-spyware" is nonsense. you cannot probe the internet without bottlenecking it and the Internet, if you understand the very term, cannot be bottlenecked. it is a fucking cloud!!! what this REALLY means is no more internet. to get their way they will need to erase the current way of doing things and turn the world wide web into something more along the lines of what was eDonkey and the old P2P system where different ips are connected to a main hub and back. that's it. closed loop. And, may i add, in order for THAT to happen you need to change the way all the systems in the world are built to something that is in non-existance in present time. The Internet IS all our computers. do you realize that? this is a thing that is impossible therefore a lie. an in-your-face lie.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You seem to mistake my argument, I'm completely with you. This is about something larger, are people here really naive enough to think the super spyware created by RIAA and being promoted to the FBI and NSA are just programs that check for "torrent programs"?

Let me explain what this really means is in simple terms - some very bad men want to own and control you - they make up a facade international board and try to enforce rules that will restrict and control commerce and e-commerce throughout the whole world by all means possible. it means if now only half of your ass is owned by the government; once this goes live your entire ass is government property and we will all walk around inside a jail with no fences as big as the planet. no internet. no free media. you don't own your credit card, your bank account, your paid for house, car and so on. fuck iPods. this is far greater than busting kids on borders searching for illegal MP3s or w/e. this is in effect an attempt to create a single government that is an overlord above all laws and countries. and what a sad attempt.<br>
<br>
@ Valiums - do you really believe this is about cracks? do you not see how this is the ground to a much larger idea? think for a minute what REALLY happens once this pass. What happens to the laws that now protect you, your freedom and your possessions? You honestly believe a law that allows governments full unwarranted searches into people's belongings and personal computers is really all about cracks? HA! even if it were that it could easily be used as ground for unspeakable crimes against humanity now made lawful.<br>
Another thing - the notion of a "super-spyware" is nonsense. you cannot probe the internet without bottlenecking it and the Internet, if you understand the very term, cannot be bottlenecked. it is a fucking cloud!!! what this REALLY means is no more internet. to get their way they will need to erase the current way of doing things and turn the world wide web into something more along the lines of what was eDonkey and the old P2P system where different ips are connected to a main hub and back. that's it. closed loop. And, may i add, in order for THAT to happen you need to change the way all the systems in the world are built to something that is in non-existance in present time. The Internet IS all our computers. do you realize that? this is a thing that is impossible therefore a lie. an in-your-face lie.</div></blockquote>

<br>
You seem to mistake my argument, I'm completely with you. This is about something larger, are people here really naive enough to think the super spyware created by RIAA and being promoted to the FBI and NSA are just programs that check for "torrent programs"? Of course this treaty is really a larger gateway for international law gaining strength in concept and practicality, and a way to make a shit load of money.</div></blockquote>

<br>
my post edited. added more to what i had to say.<br>
very true. as you can see, there is no "super-spyware" in place nor will there even be one. what their real aim is is to control the internet (which is again, utter bullshit) by placing probes inside your ISP servers. there is no other way of doing it; once live, it can marginally probe your activity and sort of police it. what a joke.<br>
<br>
Now, why this will NEVER be withheld? 2 reasons - A. you cannot really police the internet. cannot be done. been tried and as time goes by not only this becomes a shinning fact but also the general public becomes more and more advanced in its usage and understanding of the way things work. B. because eCommerce is by far the fastest growing entity in the world today. it's the largest market and it's power cannot be challenged. this is a sad attempt and obviously will crash and burn before it's airborne. if we could do a background check on the attendee list in these "secret" meetings i bet we'd find the good old faces from the good old days. the Illumi<strong class="text-strong">Naught</strong>y Pigvomits.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You're making a fundamental error when you talk about the Supreme Court challenging anything. It's not the Supreme Court that challenges a law. It's ordinary, pissed off people that challenge laws. And of course there are laws that have never been challenged. Laws are only challenged if someone gets pissed off and challenges them. That's why we have a process called Judicial Review - not Judicial Preview. Very few treaties that the United States enters into are truly controversial, and so people normally don't get pissed off and challenge them. But I can guarantee you that the Supreme Court of the United States does not avoid cases involving either Executive Orders or Treaties on their docket. Justice Scalia loves them too much to let them slide through with a simple <em class="text-italics">cert. denied</em>.<br>
<br>
On a deeper level, I disagree with the general tenor of both Valiums and Valar's responses. Just because the MPAA and the RIAA want something does not make it wrong. Intellectual property rights need to be enforced. If you want to download all your music and your movies, you're breaking the law. Plain and simple. When someone tries to stop you from breaking the law, Valar breaks out into a huge paranoid rant about how his personal freedoms are being taken away.

Oh I guess I missed the part of NAFTA being not controversial as a treaty, and has been challenged hundreds of times in court but judges are afraid to touch it. Also I never claimed challenges originate in the Supreme Court, they originate in much smaller courts, from much "smaller" people. You are incorrect assuming the Supreme Court doesn't invoke the writ of certiorari to chip away at Roe V. Wade on its more external policies such as invalidating 3rd term abortion to challenge earlier rulings simply to challenge law. <br>
<br>
In fact much of the time the writ of certiorari is done just to challenge previous rulings by the Court, to overturn them. As to your second point, the law is in our hands, I disagree with your tenor of people "violating" a general concept of intellectual property rights.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Intellectual property rights need to be enforced. i agree with you here. but that doesn't mean all i own is yours if i stole something from you. k? I should stand trial. not become a null.<br>
The standard argument against NWO theories and other popularly known as Conspiracy Theories is that it's paranoid and ignorant. Not much of an argument here is there. Disqualification of other people for having different opinions than yours doesn't work. The same approach was used by your old administration after 9/11.<br>
You need to answer claims by arguing something. anything. try something else other than paranoia and ignorance <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
I don't disqualify your post based on the fact you're a law student therefore clearly cannot hold any anti establishment beliefs.<br>
<br>
And back on topic - <em class="text-italics">Intellectual property rights need to be enforced</em> - very true. How? I may not have an answer for that but i sure as hell know the right way isn't Help Yourself To All My Stuff Solution.<br>
More:<br>
<em class="text-italics">If you want to download all your music and your movies, you're breaking the law</em> - wrong. you know perfectly well there are means of paying for intellectul properties and then downloading it. perfectly legal. the illegal part is when there is no transaction or approval by the owner / author. ouch. the "download" guideline just became a bit more complicated didn't it? It's about usage not rights. the problematic part is the USAGE!! the Rights part is already covered. remember? World Intellectual Property Organization?<br>
More:<br>
<em class="text-italics">When someone tries to stop you from breaking the law...</em> - we should be seeing the problem here by now. HOW do "we" know i'm breaking the law? HOW do "we" stop them from breaking the law? IS the Help Yourself To All My Stuff Solution really the best "we" could come up with?<br>
<br>
What i'm saying is simple - The way they think of reinforcing the law is Fascist and even if their intentions are super pure the ground this sets for Fascist laws is all too obvious. now, are we arguing about whether or not there are Fascists in the world?

Was that your retort to the public having no say in crafting digital intellectual property rights? ACTA isnt a conspiracy, international law isnt a conspiracy, its all right there.

ouchies. someone not read the whole wiki
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Border searches<br>
Potential border searches are covered by the "Border Measures" proposal of ACTA. As of February 2009, and according to University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, there is significant disagreement among countries on this topic: "Some countries are seeking the minimum rules, the removal of certain clauses, and a specific provision to put to rest fears of iPod searching customs officials by excluding personal baggage that contains goods of a non-commercial nature. The U.S. is pushing for broad provisions that cover import, export, and in-transit shipments."[41] Newspapers reported that the draft agreement would empower security officials at airports and other international borders to conduct random ex officio searches of laptops, MP3 players, and cellular phones for illegally downloaded or "ripped" music and movies. Travellers with infringing content would be subject to a fine and may have their devices confiscated or destroyed.[3][42]<br>
In July 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security disclosed that its border search policies allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to conduct random searches of electronic devices for "information concerning terrorism, narcotics smuggling, and other national security matters; alien admissibility; contraband including child pornography, monetary instruments, and information in violation of copyright or trademark laws; and evidence of embargo violations or other import or export control laws."[43][44] US Senator Russell Feingold called the policies "truly alarming" and proposed to introduce legislation to require reasonable suspicion of illegality and to prohibit racial profiling.[43] The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has previously upheld the constitutionality of laptop searches without reasonable suspicion at border crossings.[43]<br>
An ACTA fact sheet updated in November 2008, published by the European Commission, states:<br>
ACTA is not designed to negatively affect consumers: the EU legislation (2003 Customs Regulation) has a de minimis clause that exempts travellers from checks if the infringing goods are not part of large scale traffic. EU customs, frequently confronted with traffics of drugs, weapons or people, do neither have the time nor the legal basis to look for a couple of pirated songs on an i-Pod music player or laptop computer, and there is no intention to change this.[1]</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Criticism<br>
<br>
Secrecy of negotiations<br>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) opposes ACTA, calling for more public spotlight on the proposed treaty.[45] Since May 2008 discussion papers and other documents relating to the negotiation of ACTA have been uploaded to Wikileaks,[34] and newspaper reports about the secret negotiations swiftly followed.[3][42][46]<br>
In June 2008 Canadian academic Michael Geist writing for Copyright News argued that "Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy" noting before documents leaked on the internet ACTA was shrouded in secrecy. Coverage of the documents by the Toronto Star "sparked widespread opposition as Canadians worry about the prospect of a trade deal that could lead to invasive searches of personal computers and increased surveillance of online activities." Geist argues that public disclosure of the draft ACTA treaty "might put an end to fears about iPod searching border guards" and that it "could focus attention on other key concerns including greater Internet service provider filtering of content, heightened liability for websites that link to allegedly infringing content, and diminished privacy for Internet users." Geist also argues that greater transparency would lead to a more inclusive process, highlighting that the ACTA negotiations have excluded both civil society groups as well as developing countries. Geist reports that "reports suggest that trade negotiators have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements for fear of word of the treaty's provisions leaking to the public." He argues that there is a need for "cooperation from all stakeholders to battle counterfeiting concerns" and that "an effective strategy requires broader participation and regular mechanisms for feedback".[47]<br>
In November 2008 the European Commission responded to these allegations as follows:<br>
It is alleged that the negotiations are undertaken under a veil of secrecy. This is not correct. For reasons of efficiency, it is only natural that intergovernmental negotiations dealing with issues that have an economic impact, do not take place in public and that negotiators are bound by a certain level of discretion. However, there has never been any intention to hide the fact that negotiations took place, or to conceal the ultimate objectives of the negotiations, the positions taken in European Commission Trade 5/6 the negotiations or even details on when and where these negotiations are taking place. The EU and other partners (US, Japan, Canada, etc.) announced their intention to start negotiations of ACTA on 23 October 2007, in well publicised press releases. Since then we have talked about ACTA on dozens of occasions, including at the European Parliament (INTA committee meetings), and in numerous well attended seminars. Commission organised a stakeholders' consultation meeting on 23 June in Brussels, open to all – industry and citizens and attended by more than 100 participants. US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other ACTA partners did the same.[1]<br>
Threats to freedom and fundamental human rights<br>
An open letter signed by many organizations, including Consumers International, EDRi (27 European civil rights and privacy NGOs), the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), ASIC (French trade association for web 2.0 companies), and the Free Knowledge Institute (FKI), states that "the current draft of ACTA would profoundly restrict the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens, most notably the freedom of expression and communication privacy."[48] The Free Software Foundation argues that ACTA will create a culture of surveillance and suspicion.[49] Aaron Shaw, Research Fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University, argues that "ACTA would create unduly harsh legal standards that do not reflect contemporary principles of democratic government, free market exchange, or civil liberties. Even though the precise terms of ACTA remain undecided, the negotiants' preliminary documents reveal many troubling aspects of the proposed agreement" such as removing "legal safeguards that protect Internet Service Providers from liability for the actions of their subscribers" in effect giving ISPs no option but to comply with privacy invasions. Shaw further says that "[ACTA] would also facilitate privacy violations by trademark and copyright holders against private citizens suspected of infringement activities without any sort of legal due process".[50]<br>
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has published "Speak out against ACTA", stating that the ACTA threatens free software by creating a culture "in which the freedom that is required to produce free software is seen as dangerous and threatening rather than creative, innovative, and exciting."[49] ACTA would also require that existing ISP no longer host free software that can access copyrighted media; this would substantially affect many sites that offer free software or host software projects such as SourceForge. Specifically the FSF argues that ACTA will make it more difficult and expensive to distribute free software via file sharing and P2P technologies like BitTorrent, which are currently used to distribute large amounts of free software. The FSF also argues that ACTA will make it harder for users of free operating systems to play non-free media because DRM protected media would not be legally playable with free software.[49]<br>
On 10 March 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution[51] criticizing the ACTA with 663 in favor of the resolution and 13 against, arguing that "in order to respect fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy" certain changes in the ACTA content and the process should be made.[51]</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Look at you, resorting to ad hominem. <br>
<br>
Elected officials have to approve a treaty. The treaty will become public domain. The United States is only bound if it chooses to be. End of conspiracy discussion. Every time someone tells you, "I don't think talking about this is worth our time," it isn't a deflection. It could be someone is used to this kind of argument, knows how it's gonna go, and doesn't feel like going through the motions.

This is an executive agreement not a treaty that does not require congressional/senatorial approval and does not become public domain, only domain of the executives.

This is an executive agreement, and he can circumvent congress and perhaps the courts. The limits of executive agreements have not been tested by the Supreme Court to this day, so far it has affirmed all executive agreements to be within the scope of executive power, unreviewable by courts.<br>
<br>
Yes I said laws/treaties can be unconstitutional because they are different then executive agreements and are inherently reviewable. You kept arguing about treaties, so I argued about treaties with you instead of what this is, an executive agreement. Your brain is going to explode at this point, you remind of me of a ferbie that got too excited and won't turn the fuck off.

As I wrote earlier in this thread, this is wrong. <span style="font-size:200%;line-height:116%">Absolutely wrong.</span> The Judiciary can review every action by Congress or the Executive Branch.

This is not an executive order you ignorant dipshit. Executive orders and executive agreements are <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">two entirely different spheres of executive influence</strong></span>. Yes holy it may shock you but some forms of executive priviledge are unreviewable by courts, if you don't know this by now you should stick to marriage law.<br>

<br>
So lets see. I clear up the mistakes Holy made in classifying why ACTA isn't a treaty, nor executive order but an executive agreement, prove impala wrong that executive agreements exist, educate you guys on potential loss of rights and you come back with a shitty cartoon?<br>
<br>
You mustve had a bad day popping popcorn at the movie theater at minimum wage for teenagers Con. Seriously though if people don't want the truth, I won't provide it anymore. I think people like to be lied to, don't like to see how their rights are being transformed and warped and have a simple picture of things so everything seems OK. I'm done w/ the community, have fun with Impala educating you about your rights.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">All arguments about problematic legislations here and elsewhere are never countered by an argument. Not Once and not a word.<br>
The problem i think stems from the fact people generally have trouble looking at things in a broader scope. Here's a possible simplification:<br>
<br>
If you and I are partnering up for a project and we set rules and time frame and I one day disappear / end up delivering something entirely different than that agreed upon and you reproach me for it and my reaction is one of the following:<br>
<br>
Ignore you<br>
Claim you're Paranoid<br>
Dismiss you for Ignorance<br>
<br>
You would probably not get the feeling i'm sincere since i won't even humor you with an explanation or debate with you. I would then look ever the more guilty.<br>
Now, here's the broader scope - <br>
When something on a national or international scale is happening and some people are uncomfortable with it and want to get some clarifications / question it - YOU HAVE TO ANSWER THEM AS IGNORING THEM OR DISMISSING THEM AND THEIR ARGUMENTS AS PARANOID AND IGNORANT ONLY AMPLIFIES HOW PROBLEMATIC THE SUBJECT AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND IT ARE.<br>
<br>
I dare you to argue anything. something that is not outside this debate like my mental state or level of IQ.<br>
Leave aside the judiciary facet for now. Question is NOT WHETHER OR NOT PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS AND ENFORCING LAWS PROTECTING THEM IS CALLED FOR - we all agree it's called for and that stealing is stealing period. so:<br>
<br>
Are the MEANS as described in the wiki BI posted are agreeable in your eyes?<br>

-_-<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are referring to Reid V Covert of 57' then you should know the Court did not declare the treaty/executive agreement unconstitutional, the Court in its 57' decision only declared its future ability to do so in regard to treaties. Further more 57' Reid V. Covert refers explicitly to a treaty and not an executive agreement. Being as such the limitations of a defined "executive agreement" were not addressed in 57' Reid V Covert. <br>
<br>
TL;DR By my count Cheese is still 0-1, no executive agreement or treaty has been ruled unconstitutional or checked in power. The 56' Reid V. Covert was the first instance of a treaty/executive agreement being ruled unconstitutional but was withdrawn, the 57' decision did not rule it unconstitutional but only reserved the right to do so sometime in the future if it wished.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@ cheese, the Supreme Court withdrawing its own verdict is equivalent to it never happening. No true form of the Court exercising limits on executive agreements has been achieved. Reid v Covert is an odd case that not only took back what it said but reclassified what was clearly an executive agreement to a treaty for reasons completely baffling. <br>
<br>
I believe the reason the Court did was pressure from the Eisenhower administration and plees not to infringe on the powers of executive agreements. All of the technical arguing aside at least its been a relatively healthy debate besides the few idiots posting internet meme's.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Valium's convenient switch in argument,from overriding the Constitution and ACTA being an international Treaty that means anything the executive wants, to some kind of lame "Executive Agreement" point, is a lot of nonsense.<br>
<br>
An Executive Agreement covers almost anything negotiated or forged by the President. I guess Val;iums point is "OMFG!!! The President is the Executive and actually has some POWER!!!!!", which shouldn't be news to anyone. The US President is the most powerful position on earth.<br>
<br>
Executive Agreements are LEGION. They run from mundane legalese in trade, major trade inroads, secret deals during war (as Commander) (Iran Contra, Potsdam...), and extreme measures during dire situations (Maritial Law).<br>
<br>
Most Executive agreements are handled by Congress. Most of the time, it is part of a treaty ratified.<br>
<br>
Valium's seems to be equating ACTA with internment of Japanese during WWII or the suspension of Habeus Corpus by Lincoln, which is, of course, nonsense.<br>
His paranoia leads him to associate Executive Agreement with the most secretive and powerful sweeping orders during Emergencies and War.<br>
<br>
ACTA is a mundane Anti-Counterfeiting/Copyright attempt to align the definitions and prosecutions across International lines.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with the FBI busting down BI's door and taking his Computer.<br>
<br>
If Valiums had more than a plebiscites history of Government and experience in how almost nothing goes long secretively and certainly not unchallenged in some way, he might not fail to Hyperbole  and Wiggle Worm false arguments at every turn, like some conspiracy nut.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

2) Do me a favor bro, quti waving the <em class="text-italics">conspiracy nuts</em> flag. there are nuts. period. not every person claiming there is something going on which we don't know the full truth about is a nut. Maybe the easiest argument coming from people who are arguing against Conspiracy Theories is to throw their interlocutor on the same wagon with all the real nuts. easy but not true.<br>
Here's a fun fact, just to show different views thrive in different cultures: In Israel we have an extreme left wing epidemic in the media and general public. If a Minister or a high office / high rank person is suspected of any type of inappropriate conduct they would be taken to trial and the media would be all over it like vultures on carrions. If IDF during the last operation in Gaza was suspected to have used illegal weapons against the population - it was all over the fucking news night and day. to the point you'd sit there watching the news and ask yourself "what are these people thinking? don't they know they are actually hurting their own country by going public about it without getting the facts straight first?". but that's extreme left wing purists and i digress. I'm mentioning that because looking at how things are done in the US i can't help but smile at the fact that far worse shit goes on and no one stands trial. nothing's wrong. it's all good. I see that as a state of mind.<br>
3) Your argument that there is nothing secretive or that nothing secretive can remain secretive for long is false. you as veteran know that perfectly well regardless of your political views. CIA arming Bin Laden in the 80s you mean to tell me was on national news? Bush family being board of directors in the Carlyle Group was on national news at any point before 9/11? let's admit to the facts. there are many secrets. both evil and benign. at the end of the day all high level positions are held by people. you and me. imperfect human beings with beliefs and agendas.<br>
4) The fact that Money and Power are married and Money wears the pants around the house is for some odd reason always pushed aside by some people, usually right wing extremists.<br>

That was just a fictional story to try the bring us all to the truth of the lizards.  The writer of that episode was murdered shortly there after.  His killer was never found, but we all know who was responsible.<br>

You know after re-reading this entire thread for the first time I hope you don't actually think Holy's first page post you labeled as a "flawless victory" was a victory at all. His case citations of Youngstown vs Sheet and Reid V. Covert have nothing to do with executive agreements.<br>
<br>
/meh your a Canadian though, I don't expect you to understand the intricacies of U.S. law just as I wouldnt pretend to understand provincial kingdom law in Canada. I had to get that in there, for one last time that this is an <span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">executive agreement</strong></span>, and people should educate themselves on what ACTA means to us. If you don't want to or don't care so be it, but at least true patriots will have made an effort to understand it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't subscribe to a lot he's saying. he got me all through the bloodlines and power elites but lost me with the fantastic connections. I love fantasy and fiction but i'm afraid the Lizardrama lost me. In any case, NWO, regardless of some people making the connection with Lizards (lawl) has nothing to do with science fiction. It concerns very much alive and real people and has been documented for years and years.<br>

	<div class="content">LOL,  for some reason I can't see their website.  Must be because I called them on their claim that one of their clan members was the creator of Singe's maps. I posted about this in the Dept. of Architecture.<br>
It's pretty lame that Singe actually had to post a disclaimer on his site, but I guess he has to do something to protect himself.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>And now, before we get to the maps, a brief clarification. People post my maps various places online and that's great cause it generally gets them and me more exposure. However, not appropriate is when people post my maps and claim they made them. I've recently come across a site where my maps are posted and the claim is made, "<a href="http://singe.telefragged.com/hl2/maps/" class="postlink">http://singe.telefragged.com/hl2/maps/</a> All maps here are created by Singe aka Arie - Lets not have any more misunderstandings with this alright?". I'm glad they credited me for my maps and gave a link back to this site but I AM NOT ARIE. Arie seems to be the person who runs that particular site but WE ARE NOT THE SAME PERSON AND HE DID NOT MAKE ANY OF THESE MAPS. I just wanted to make that clear. </div></blockquote><a href="http://singe.telefragged.com/hl2/maps/" class="postlink">http://singe.telefragged.com/hl2/maps/</a><br>

p.s.  Gosh there's nothing on our website indicating that EYE has ever had a 7v7 with DD. How odd...  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

what i think their doing is trying to get people to rent servers from them and they are trying to make themselves sound like a reputable clan by saying they have beaten real good clans so not so good clans will buy from them. if you go the server list where it shows all the serevers and arrange it they have like 40 servers and theyre the first ones on the list</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also watched the vid that potato posted (Why bitches like you complain).  He uses only one weapon for the most part with the exception of a couple of shots from the xbow.  I didnt see any type of advanced movement.  Also if he was playing in a server full of relative newbies then yeah he might be raping them just like anyone that has been playing this game for a while might do.  <br>

I would love to see a Sctv match with these guys vs ewr, flas, etc.  They want to brag about how good they are, prove it.  No SS or it didnt happen.  To say that ewr and VDuS would ask that no SS be posted is absurd.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I am here to tell you what it is, You can take it for a grain of salt or other I don't really care though. The clans that were listed on our website that were played against were posted a very long time ago. Back when even Drum God Clan was live and healthy. It was along time ago. As for all of you other people complaining about the server and all this gossip crap. You need to actually go read about SRCDS - Go learn what its core and frame is about. Maybe then you will understand what our servers are about. For you people that have been banned on multiple accounts, You run your mouth and talk crap, of course we are going to ban you. Were not showing all these other things for publicity and what not. As far as all the clan matches are concerned they were a long time ago and our website has gone through alot of changes and since then we do not have, half of the things that we had before. One mistake is on the WIN [EYE] 7v7 part - That was actually a 1v1 , We used to have an older manager that used to help manage the website and that mistake is on his part. The <a href="http://singe.telefragged.com" class="postlink">http://singe.telefragged.com</a> was also was his fault I have talked personally to Singe about this and he has a complete understanding on what has happened. Another statement towards the other remarks that were made towards our clan battles. We never played anything larger than a 4v4 although we would have liked to play larger like 10v10 or 16v16. We had some one come on to Berium last night and say that E*C Had beat us in a 11vs11. Trying to keep our cool we simply just left. I don't want problems and the sad thing is you children have to much time on your hands. It shows by your gossip and your rude behavior. You can talk as much shit on us. We could care less. We have more positive feed back about our servers and clan than negative remarks could ever be made. So go ahead. Try to hurt our "Reputation" You will only make us smile.

If it's so long ago and you don't have screens proving it, then take it off the site. It's insulting to those clans (and as others have stated, ewr is fairly new so it can't have been that long ago when you beat them).<br>

	<div class="content">Ok I been looking around here on the HL2DM University and I have come across this. I have been a pretty frequent visitor here. I like to check out the forum and such to see the newest news on clans and sorts. But I have come across on this thread. All I have to say is wow...<br>
<br>
There is a many things that I have seen posted here that are not true. Things from both sides of the net.<br>
<br>
Now remember. I am not coming to anyones defense. I dont know much about ÐÐ But I do know some of the things that are being said here on this forum are definitely not true about them. I do know they have been around since TFC and some of this crap was pulled on them back then. As far as I know they really do not give a rats ass. I have played with Diablo a few times, He has never been known to call anyone a hacker. Thats a fact that I have set for stone.  So Potato you might want to get your fact straight.<br>
<br>
Many remarks have also been made about their servers. Which you know causes a little curiosity in me so I went to have a look see. One thing about their servers I will agree, Shit hawls ass. But I do not think it is the tick rate. I have been working with SRCDS For some time now and have not been able to get my servers to run like theirs, However, Their servers are running at 220 Tickrate. I have a checked a few of their servers. They have alot of servers running the same IP but I highly doubt that they are on the same box. 20 100 tickrate servers empty bog down a decent box. These guys are hosting more than 50 servers for other clans and such at the moment from the list that I pulled up. Enough talk heres the image.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img237.imageshack.us/img237/4968/220tickserversne9.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
As far as their talk about their hosting. All that I could find was 100% true. About these clan matches however - It does sound a bit fishy, But thats for you guys to debait about. The only thing that I do want to point out though. Think about what you guys are saying. Downgrading some one and calling them all a bunches of pieces of shit and any relations is wrong. And Im sure that was not the reason why HL2DM University was put here. You guys kinda seem really tight on the subject. Loosen up a bit. So a clan lied about something stupid like winning matches. Leave em be. Im sure you have all screwed up in some point in time too. We didnt hold it against you and make a damn forum on a website about you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">OK, Guys. I wasn't going to get involved with this thread, but I don't like to see any type of clan bashing. I had my share of that crap back in the KAT clan. I think we are all here to get along as a community, to try to work together and to have fun playing this foolish addictive <span style="color:red">"GAME"</span> called HL2DM. Do I care what other clans post on their website or forum regarding matches played. Not in the least, unless they were against my clan and were not accurate. Then I would want to set the record straight.<br>
<br>
Since anklebiter brought up the fact that we are renting a few servers from the DD clan, I felt I should give some input. Are their servers what they claim to be? I'll let you know in a few weeks once our players and friends have had a chance to give them a good play. I don't mind trying new things. As you may recall back when I posted about us using a 32 slot server for our events you all gave your 2 cents. <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=1784&amp;p=21822#p21822" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... 822#p21822</a> None of which I took offence to. The more input the better. That's the best way to deal when you're in unknown territory. Haven't had any major problems running a 32 slot server for HL2DM.<br>
<br>
What I always look for is to provide the best possible playing experience for our players and friends. Using different settings on a server or running a higher tick rate may be uncomfortable to many of you, but it is ALWAYS worth giving it a shot. Just because you are not familiar with it doesn't mean you won't enjoy it.<br>
Most of you are used to playing with the more common settings so it may feel uncomfortable at first, but you may like it. After all isn't variety the spice of life.<br>
<br>
Maybe to feed your curiosity you should join us tonight on our event server for our TEAM STRATEGY Maps event. It is a DD server running a tick rate of 220 and holds 32 players. Try not to judge how others set up their servers until you have had a chance to <span style="color:red">PLAY</span> those settings. If after playing them and you don't like it. Then don't play them.<br>

I The server only allow cl_updatrate 60 because there is no sv_maxupdaterate value in the server config and so uses the default of 60.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
<br>
"cl_updaterate" = "60" ( def. "20" )<br>
** NOTE: The real value is 220.000 but the server has temporarily restricted it to 60.000 **</div></blockquote>
Also cannot get the cmdrate higher than 100 even though my fps is much higher than 100 on cp_frenzy<br>
whether adding these to the server config will solve that problem I do not know.<br>
sv_max_updaterate 220<br>
sv_max_cmdrate 220<br>
 But one thing we all know is 100 tick is broken it messes with the physics and the way the xbow shoots and can even make doors open slowly so god knows how 220 is unless the way that server plays is down to 220 tick itself?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i do believe me and others have repeatedly tried to have 1v1 and 2v2 with you, let me tell you about my experiences, first 1v1 dumfuck (diablo) didnt lock the server for whatever reason, i went like 36-1 on a free for all and got kicked and banned, next day i 1v1 somebody from DD, think it was you actually, and i was winning so diablo, being in spec, would jump in and out on my team takin away a kill because for whatever reason it was on teams, then i 1v1 diablo and was beating him so then the other one jumped in so now it was a 1v2 and i ended up winning so i was kicked and banned. then yesterday me and black flame from EC came in, he asked for a 2v2 and the guy from DD it was either riddick or daxter didnt say a word to us and just kicked and banned us. thats 3 servers in 3 days, im shootin for 40 servers in 40 days, im off to go get banned again =]</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, it is possible someone mis-represented those clans, which is why it is standard practise that if you are going to post scrim results, you post scoreboard screen shots along with them so the teams in question can see who apparently played. I would recommend removing the record unless someone on your team can produce the screenshots to back it up.<br>

	<div class="content">I don't think clan bashing is the best practice but on the other hand sometimes it needs to happens so that a clan realizes they cannot spew any lie they want and no one will call them out on it. And sometimes it helps the members of a clan to see the organizations for what it is.  The U is a good place for that because it is not linked to a particular clan. DD has obviously made up some complete and total horse shit. I can distinctly remember just about any match my clan has lost cause it has been very few and none were ever to DD the only ones that ever did happen were to other CAL clans. We may have actually played their clan because we played alot of clans on all sorts of messed up servers and settings through the years but we never lost to any in a match I played in except on very stock CAL maps and settings against other good CAL teams. On top of that your server rentals are amazing prices for what you appear to offer. Over double the top tick rate and never overloaded haha yeah right. Well when we already know you are making up complete lies that make no sense it only seems to reason the information about servers is also horse shit. Because you have already shown you have no moral objection to making shit up. It would be reasonable to think that maybe just maybe you accidentally made a typo about playing the game 10 years longer then it existed but when there are so many other lies on top of that it is ridiculous to think they are not deliberate.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

hey deathmaker, id be up for a 1v1 if you are in the mood and if you don't want to play send your best DD member, if he can get 10 kills on me you get your money back!<br>
<br>
also, I think it's safe to say that me and some fellow ewR members would more than gladly beat your ass in a match to shut you the hell up.  All we ask is (what Zman pointed out earlier) that we play a map that we somewhat know, and that we dont have to play on your server with shellshock, full sprint, 1 shot shottie, grav 20, spawn protection, no nades, 0.5 shot pistol, constant sounds, votemap popping up, 1000 spectators, 3 hour timelimit, etc... turned on.  And are you saying that we play two matches on your server and the tiebreaker on ours?  That means that we won't get to use ours :'(</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Whether either was intentional or not is irrelevant. But that's why this thread was created. And naturally people are going to get a little nosy to see what's up. And you know what? If Diablo would have kept his cool on the top of page 3 and answered the accusations with logical explanations or simply some apologies this whole thread would have dissipated. But he instead to chose to make some asshat posts and basically pussyfoot around the actual questions while taking no blame for his clan and insulting everyone who posed them. Why don't you man up and stop being such a child?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>

In conclusion: Legitimate concerns + bullshit answers = clan bashing, which leads to IMO some very entertaining threads.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Since when do you tell us how we should run this website? If you think calling someone out for lying is immature, then you have a lot to learn about life. If I felt this thread was out of line I would have locked and/or deleted it.<br>

I think the entire community can see quite clearly who has made an ass of themselves and who hasn't. That's the beauty of this thing called freedom of speech.<br>

Nobody makes the University look like shit. This is a community forum and each person represents only themself and their clan. Not being able to separate the two is a common problem and something people often struggle with it appears.<br>

Go play golf if its more entertaining. Its not like anyone here is spewing slurs except for a few DD people, but at times that can be excused within reason.<br>

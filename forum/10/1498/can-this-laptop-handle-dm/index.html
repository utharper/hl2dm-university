	<div class="content">Hey guys, I need some advice here.  I'm going to be stuck away from home for a long period of time for some work related training coming up and I have a DELL Latitude D630 laptop that I'll be taking with me.  I have never gamed on a laptop before and don't know what to expect.  It looks like the specs are as follows:<br>
<br>
XP Professional w/SP2<br>
Intel Core2 Duo T7300 @ 2.00GHz<br>
1.99 GB of RAM<br>
For display adapters it's showing Mobile Intel 965 Express Chipset Family<br>
Logitech wireless mouse<br>
61.5 GB Free disk space<br>
<br>
Also, if you think this will work, what settings should I have set to make sure I experience a very minimal amount of lag and the most enjoyment?  I haven't loaded the game yet but am strongly considering it so I don't turn suicidal from absolute boredom, plus I don't know how long I can go without playing DM!!

	<div class="content">How may MB of vid ram  does it have?  I fit has 256 you should be ok.  You prob won't be L33T with that but you can at least play.<br>
<br>
Go into thw Win XP control panel (forget where it is exactly if you need help finding it I can look at mine) and set up XP for performance not for the pretty extra BS they include.  Turn off the screen saver and the fancy desktop picture.  When you start it, shut down any non-essential crap running in the back ground from te system tray.  Finally, put the game vid settings on lower settings to help the vid processor render the picture better.  I would try it asap so you know what you are in for.  I had a pentium 3 laptop with 256 97 vid ram and 500 mb ram that barely ran the game, but I took it with me on trips until it died.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've helped some people figure out problems trying to run HL2 with computers that ran this chipset (intel 965) and it used to cause extreme low fps. I just checked the intel site and it appears they may have a new driver to resolve the issue. You may want to download this driver incase you have trouble.<br>

Intel on board graphics is not worth the bother trust me i have a 256mb radeon mobility card and it can only run it at lowest graphics to get 160fps. save your self the heartache and don't buy it. I recommend at least 2gb ram with a nvedia or radeon graphics on board  for a laptop and don't get a wireless mouse.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Intel graphics are pretty low end, that will be your main problem. If you aren't shy about modification its a nice computer if you just drop a 8600M in there or something. <br>
Basically that GPU the main bottle neck.  Also as for the ram if you have access to bios you may be able to alter what it can access, but onboard will leach the system ram. <br>

Also since you brought it up you might like this article about what nvidia has to say about intels graphics <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3282" class="postlink">http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=3282</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i play on a lap top,<br>
here is some avice.<br>
<br>
how many USB ports does the lt have/? if not too many and you need more my may want to invest in a USB hub.<br>
<br>
i use a full keyboard that is usb b/c it can take the beating. <br>
The usual laptop flimsy key's can't handle the constand WASD pressing.<br>
<br>
i would also think of getting laptop cooler, my LT gets pretty hot and the cooler really does help.<br>
<br>
it's a lot of other crap to bring with you...<br>
<br>
also,<br>
where will you be headed? <br>
As a last ditch effort you can always look for a LAN/Gaming center. steam website has a list of 'cyber cafe's on their site. <br>
<br>
After my apt got robbed and i was without a system i would go to a place, it was bout 1 hr or a flat fee for an 'all nighter'. <br>
only problem is PC's are so cheap nowadays these places go under all the time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hey guys, well I loaded DM on the laptop and smaller maps seem to run pretty good, my ping is usually about 5ms (on LAN).  As soon as I get into larger maps (dm_resistance and larger) things get pretty rough and my ping will rocket up to 80ms and laggy as Hell on LAN.  I suspect this is probably due to my graphics.  I have everything set to low.  Should I do anything else as far as screen size (full vs. wide)?  I have also closed out anything running in the background that I could.  Any other pointers?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Reality:<br>
<br>
We joined the 4v4 with four players knowing it would be hard to schedule matches when we went in. The fact that I am typically only online between 10pm and midnight PST alone limits the time available to play. Add to that one of our other players gets up in the small hours to go to work and it gets even harder.<br>
<br>
Most people accept this fact and arent douchebags about it. We tried to schedule matches with you guys, but it didn't work out (big fucking deal get over it), so then you guys show up in our server late one night and demand we play with 3. In four seasons of playing in CAL, as far as I have known the rules have always stated and been enforced that you can not play with less than the full team, so we didn't agree to play since it wouldn't count anyway. That's why we didn't agree, not because we are afraid of losing. At that time I wasn't aware of any allowances being made by the CAL admins so I said no.<br>
<br>
Teto contacted me after that incident and scheduled the match for the following Monday. You guys didn't show. I even asked for Tuesday as a backup day, again you didn't show. <br>
<br>
Then you start talking shit to us, saying we were scared of playing you. That makes no sense, given we took matches against better teams than yours. Your whole stance on this is a joke, and now everyone gets to see you for what you are. <br>
<br>
So yeah, reap what you sow is true. I wont be fragging with a poor sport like you anytime soon. Usually I recommend CS players come and play HL2DM instead, but in your case I'm going to have to recommend the opposite.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

actually I contacted you to tell you that I was sorry for my team being gay, but I NEVER rescheduled the match for a MONDAY or TUESDAY due to school complications, I remember this because I was never allowed on past 10 on school days. it was either 8pm est./earlier or weekends, but as far as "shit talking" goes I wasn't doing any of it so by shit talkers I hope you mean the other "person/persons"<br>

Yes, you did contact me to tell me that, which I did and still do appreciate. Sorry if I got the days wrong, I thought it was mon/tues but the match comm is gone so I couldnt check for sure.

	<div class="content">How about we just delete this damn topic already sigh. Slick likes causing drama cause its fun for him. hes trying to call people out because he feels hes been wronged in someway. Get over it slick just a game if people are pissen you off cause they're not playing scrims with you then fine that's their choice. I doubt any of your complaining about it on here will get you anywhere.<br>
<br>
You say you don't care about the game but then continue to give people shit when they decide not to play you. then you post on a community forum saying how people are doing this for dumb reasons and you go off to list a bunch of valid reasons for not playing DM.<br>
<br>
Lately you've jumped down my throat for not playing you in DM. Which I've decided against completely now. I truly was busy all the other times you asked. Now its just because I don't like you. As for the other players in this game I can't speak for them but I bet a lot of em feel the same way, its not a lot of fun to play with someone when they get bitchy at you for not playing them some other times. And then when they come and post about how they don't give a shit about the game and are just here to laugh at us for saying "Fuck You"... and then hope that that will get them more scrims? seems a bit like backwards thinking to me. = \</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No, plenty of us have nice things in hl2dm, including good times, fun scrims ect. ect.<br>
<br>
It's only the immature dumbasses that cant have nice things, and something tells me that by this statement:

	<div class="content">Slick you may consider it a meaningless action, but we all know that in reality spraying someone after a kill is meant to be a demeaning, flaming, put down meant to rile up the opponent.  It is absolutely intentional.  People dont want to play you because you act like an asshole.  Its not <strong class="text-strong">FUN</strong> to play with assholes, period.  I would rather play against FLaS and get my ass kicked all over the map than play with someone that acts like you do.  At least they treat the team the beat with some semblance of respect for at least trying and they dont laugh about it and flame you afterwards.  Who the hell are you that we really should give a shit that you "lawl" at us for not playing you. <br>
<br>
I watched the video of your match against Stoopidity and Poor Billy and laughed my ass off at how stupid you were in that game.  I mean really, PB is so bad hes actually good?  You may not care, but other people do.  I have been reading Sirlin's book, <em class="text-italics">Playing to Win</em>.  There is a section on sportsmanship and in it he states that behavoir such as yours "are more likely to make you look stupid, and create an air of negativity that will follow you."   I have to agree, you dug your own grave, have fun down there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

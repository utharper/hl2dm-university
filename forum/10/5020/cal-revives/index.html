that code tells a broswer what to display on the search results page.  the "spiders" or "crawlers" look for that as well as the meta keywords.  the keywords are used to match what ever you searched on and the meta description is what it will display in the summary of the page.  so for example, if you searched on CAL in yahoo or google the results for CAL would include a page that had, included in the summary, "coming back soon" therefore enticing(sp?) you to click on the link and therefore seeing the timer.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I had an email converation recently with the CAL admin that was our division supervisor for CAL HL2DM.   She said that if CAL was coming back it was going to start of as HoN (?) only.  Im not sure what that is but in any case it is not the same people that were running it before.  <br>
<br>
When CAL died, the admins got split into two groups and both were planning on making new leagues to replace CAL.  One of those groups formed ECO and they were pretty much the CSS contingent of CAL.  They have absolutely no interest in HL2DM, I tried.  The other group, which would have brought in HL2DM failed after a year due to a lack of coders for the website so they gave up.  <br>
<br>
To be honest I dont see a new league picking up HL2DM because we just dont have enough people playing it competatively anymore to make it attractive, besides the fact that there are no sponsors for this game.  CU is our best bet because they are dedicated to this game.  CU has done a pretty good job so far and TBH I think we are probably better off with them because they at least understand the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The games way too small to attract the interest of any leagues ATM. I think Season 2 CU might be our last strong season but after that not too sure about the game. Either way I'll probably step down and hand it to someone else, not because I'm getting tired of it or I think its gonna be completely dead by s3 but I believe in the concept of limited term leadership in general.<br>

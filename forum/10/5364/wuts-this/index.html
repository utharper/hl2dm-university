	<div class="content">7:06 PM - Bitey: 1 double shot almost dead<br>
7:06 PM - Bitey: I use the under-used weapons for my enjoyment<br>
7:06 PM - Bitey: like ar2 BULLETS<br>
7:06 PM - Bitey: no orbs<br>
7:06 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:07 PM - Bitey: Gotta use my 21 inches of 360 room for something<br>
7:07 PM - Bitey: I'm suprized there isnt many of those kind of players in this game<br>
7:07 PM - Bitey: or people who use bhop scripts like me<br>
7:07 PM - Bitey: it's just simplier to hop<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: and the knowledge that lower sentivity leads to precision<br>
7:08 PM - _nervous.: you bunnyhop script?<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: yes<br>
7:08 PM - _nervous.: :/<br>
7:08 PM - _nervous.: why?<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: Because I got tired of hoping normally<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: I did it for a year and a half<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: and it's just tedious mwhell rolling work<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: and hl2dm<br>
7:08 PM - _nervous.: LOL<br>
7:08 PM - _nervous.: i use space<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: it's like fuck<br>
7:08 PM - _nervous.: how fast do you go?<br>
7:08 PM - Bitey: ROLL ROLL ROLL ROL ROLL<br>
7:09 PM - Bitey: eh i think on the good start I get 480 and can keep it above 400 forever as long as it's fairly straight<br>
7:09 PM - _nervous.: with the script?<br>
7:09 PM - Bitey: Basically you dont need to stop and start again<br>
7:09 PM - Bitey: the script matters little for the first jump<br>
7:09 PM - Bitey: but it keeps your friction low<br>
7:09 PM - _nervous.: you made the script?<br>
7:09 PM - Bitey: Nope<br>
7:09 PM - Bitey: got it from someone in dystopia<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: oh wow<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: don't give it out<br>
7:10 PM - Bitey: lol alittle late for that<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: the last thing this game needs is tons of bhop skiddies<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: WTF<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: you gave it to skitlz didn't you?<br>
7:10 PM - Bitey: yes<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: he told me he bhop scripts<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: .........<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: why.....<br>
7:10 PM - _nervous.: who did you give it to?<br>
7:10 PM - Bitey: Because?<br>
7:10 PM - Bitey: it's knowledge that should be shared<br>
7:10 PM - Bitey: and everyone should know how to bhop<br>
7:10 PM - Bitey: because it's a joking unfair skill to know<br>
7:11 PM - Bitey: Well look at it like this<br>
7:11 PM - Bitey: The way to bhop is three steps<br>
7:11 PM - Bitey: you have to sprint and then jump to start<br>
7:11 PM - Bitey: and then you want to hold the speed<br>
7:11 PM - Bitey: clearly you cant hold it with space for vey long<br>
7:11 PM - Bitey: it just fizzles out<br>
7:11 PM - Bitey: with mwhell your taking time away from aiming<br>
7:12 PM - Bitey: so what are you left with<br>
7:12 PM - Bitey: you can choose all the stupid ineffective ways of hopping<br>
7:12 PM - Bitey: or you can do it the smart way<br>
7:12 PM - _nervous.: uh<br>
7:12 PM - _nervous.: i can hold a 420~ for like 6 seconds<br>
7:12 PM - _nervous.: 7 seconds<br>
7:12 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:12 PM - _nervous.: with space<br>
7:12 PM - Bitey: that's short<br>
7:12 PM - Bitey: or well<br>
7:12 PM - Bitey: nah lol<br>
7:12 PM - Bitey: There isnt many places where you can go for 7 seconds<br>
7:12 PM - _nervous.: i can bunnyhop better than skitlz, by far<br>
7:12 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:13 PM - _nervous.: you'd be surprised<br>
7:13 PM - _nervous.: play dm_asylum<br>
7:13 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:13 PM - _nervous.: dm_Asylum_b9<br>
7:13 PM - _nervous.: lots of long hallways<br>
7:13 PM - Bitey: I played that<br>
7:13 PM - Bitey: Do you run out of sprint?<br>
7:13 PM - Bitey: lol lets go try it out right now <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
7:13 PM - Bitey: hitting space isnt a skill<br>
7:13 PM - Bitey: that's what someone from dystopia told me ealier lol<br>
7:14 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:14 PM - _nervous.: who else did you give it out to?<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: when I told him about someone bitching about a macro for jumping<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: lol some guy who I regret telling<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: I was talking about it with skittles<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: and this guy joined and asked about it<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: so I told him<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: some .org guy<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: rages alot<br>
7:14 PM - _nervous.: marky?<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: and isn't very good<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: yeah he has it too<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: but i doubt he'll do anything with it<br>
7:14 PM - Bitey: he has the worst movement of anyone i've seen<br>
7:15 PM - Bitey: the skill is in the mouse movement and stafe keys<br>
7:15 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:15 PM - _nervous.: do me a fav and the rest of this game a favor and stop giving it out?<br>
7:15 PM - Bitey: I was acutally planning to post it in the hl2dm fourms<br>
7:15 PM - Bitey: because I think that everyone should know about it<br>
7:15 PM - Bitey: and how stupid bhop is for source by default<br>
7:16 PM - Bitey: I dunno I suppose if you REALLY want me not to<br>
7:16 PM - Bitey: you wanna have it?<br>
7:16 PM - _nervous.: no<br>
7:16 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:16 PM - _nervous.: go ahead, post it<br>
7:16 PM - _nervous.: i can bhop fine withoout it<br>
7:17 PM - _nervous.: i mean<br>
7:17 PM - _nervous.: i know what script you use<br>
7:17 PM - _nervous.: the autohotkey one<br>
7:17 PM - _nervous.: ?<br>
7:17 PM - Bitey: duh<br>
7:17 PM - _nervous.: bind space every 10 milliseconds<br>
7:17 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:17 PM - Bitey: nope<br>
7:17 PM - Bitey: not quite<br>
7:17 PM - Bitey: here let me just show you<br>
7:17 PM - Bitey: -------- script was here --------------------<br>
7:17 PM - Bitey: How it works<br>
7:17 PM - Bitey: on-off<br>
7:18 PM - Bitey: the first two lines<br>
7:18 PM - _nervous.: err<br>
7:18 PM - _nervous.: i don't want it brag<br>
7:18 PM - _nervous.: brah*<br>
7:18 PM - Bitey: well I'm telling you how it works<br>
7:18 PM - Bitey: lol<br>
7:18 PM - Bitey: markymark.org: no recoil hax? lmfao...funny<br>
markymark.org is now playing Half-Life 2: Deathmatch. Click here to join.<br>
markymark.org: you telling nervous a bunch of shit? I didn't go and ask you for some macro shit<br>
markymark.org: you told me I needed to get it<br>
7:18 PM - _nervous.: yeah? i asked him if he uses it<br>
7:18 PM - Bitey: but basically you choose a key for it to work with<br>
7:18 PM - _nervous.: and he said no<br>
7:18 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:18 PM - Bitey: then you choose the key it spams<br>
7:18 PM - Bitey: I have it setup so it spams the key I held<br>
7:19 PM - Bitey: I didnt write<br>
7:19 PM - Bitey: but I just know how it works lol<br>
7:19 PM - _nervous.: lol<br>
7:19 PM - _nervous.: go ahead and post it on the university<br>
7:19 PM - Bitey: honesly I think they'll just say "WHAT ELSE DO YOU USE HACKER"<br>
7:19 PM - Bitey: or some other drama will come to me<br>
7:19 PM - Bitey: I'd rather juts keep passing it out one at a time<br>
7:19 PM - Bitey: And let them do the work<br>
7:20 PM - _nervous.: dude, don't pass it out lol.<br>
7:20 PM - Bitey: Why not?<br>
7:20 PM - _nervous.: because hopping is part of the game and if people want to do it then they should learn how to on their own<br>
7:21 PM - Bitey: Yeah and hopping isnt about hitting space or rolling a wheel<br>
7:21 PM - _nervous.: it's not about holding a button either<br>
7:21 PM - Bitey: it's the control of strafe and mouse<br>
7:21 PM - Bitey: This same debate happend in dystopia lol<br>
7:21 PM - Bitey: they ended up changing hopping<br>
7:21 PM - Bitey: to how it is in quake<br>
7:22 PM - Bitey: your jump key fires as soon as it hits the groun<br>
7:22 PM - Bitey: if you're holding it<br>
7:22 PM - Bitey: and by far it is indeed for the greater balance of the game<br>
7:22 PM - Bitey: basically it'd be a skill that seporates pros and non pros by such a huge gap<br>
7:22 PM - Bitey: and the only way to learn it is from another player<br>
7:23 PM - Bitey: The game has enough balance flaws that the script should be public knowledge lol<br>
7:23 PM - Bitey: I dunno it's just my idea of bhopping in general<br>
7:25 PM - _nervous.: just stop passing it out brah<br>
7:25 PM - _nervous.: people who want to move efficently<br>
7:25 PM - _nervous.: efficiently* can learn it<br>
7:25 PM - Bitey: This is like a debate of passing out knowledge<br>
7:25 PM - _nervous.: it's not knowledge<br>
7:26 PM - _nervous.: knowledge would be the muscle memory of bunnyhopping manually<br>
7:26 PM - Bitey: It's making it easier to learn to do a skill<br>
7:26 PM - Bitey: It adds more steps that shouldnt be there<br>
7:26 PM - Bitey: you've got more then enough to think about "wasd control, Mouse control" that alone leads to so many things to think about<br>
7:26 PM - Bitey: then to remeber to slam space or roll a wheel<br>
7:27 PM - Bitey: I suppose I'll only tell people if they ask me, because that's how I teach people is when they ask<br>
7:28 PM - Bitey: Not many will ask though<br>
7:28 PM - Bitey: because they dont care enough =&lt;<br>
7:28 PM - Bitey: it's like the same idea of why someone would say "Why do you cheat bitey" instead of "How do you aim so well?"<br>
7:29 PM - _nervous.: does it matter? you don't aimbot, do you?<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: so it is legit<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: you aim<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: then people can ask how do you aim so well?<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: it's your own skill<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: just like your own skill of bunnyhopping<br>
7:30 PM - Bitey: It's not just my own skill it's a style of shooting<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: that's like saying that everyone should have an aimbot, because that's like restricting knowledge<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: you already have enough to worry about, i mean wasd control, moving your mouse TO ACTUALLY BE ON THE PERSON?<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: SHIT<br>
7:30 PM - _nervous.: TOO MUCH WORK<br>
7:31 PM - _nervous.: whatever<br>
7:31 PM - _nervous.: this conversation is done<br>
7:31 PM - _nervous.: good day, sir<br>

	<div class="content">i compare the bhop to a manual shift car.  when you first learn how to do it you're horible, stalling, studdering.  then you start to learn how not to stall, but your still not great at it, might grind a gear or not properly down shift.  then after a while you drive and shift without even thinking about it.  your little script there is like the automatic trans.  im sure it works just fine, and its great for ppl that are just to stupid or lazy to learn it on there own.   you will find out in life there is always an easy way out, today more then ever.  all your logic prolly makes perfect sense to you.  but here's the thing, the ppl that come here on a daily basis are are talented gamers that actually took the time to learn how to bhop, strafe jump, etc on their own.  for me, and im sure i speak for most here, it was a sense of personal acheivement.  knowing i dont need a script to hold my hand.  ya, we do have to bhop, and aim, and everything else, all at the same time in a fast paced, high intensity environment.  this is what some refer to as skill.  it doesnt come over night.  ppl here have been playing this game for many, many years.   i also know for a fact that 99% of the players here would be willing to help you out with any questions you might have, all you have to do is ask. <br>
<br>
now, with that said, dont think for a second that you can come in here and post your fucking lazy ass, pussy bhop script and then back it up with your childish, immature, fuck-a-guy in the ass and not give him a reach around reasoning, and think we are going to be impressed and extend you a hand shake and an "atta-boy, why didnt we think of that" post.  sooooooo, welcome to the U, now GTFO, and take your script with you.<br>

<br>
now, with that said, dont think for a second that you can come in here and post your fucking lazy ass, pussy bhop script and then back it up with your childish, immature, fuck-a-guy in the ass and not give him a reach around reasoning, and think we are going to be impressed and extend you a hand shake and an "atta-boy, why didnt we think of that" post.  sooooooo, welcome to the U, now GTFO, and take your script with you.<br>

	<div class="content">Nervous, you can google it anyways,...it's a macro, not a script.<br>
I suppose it is just as bad as scripting, but unfortunately, much easier to find than scripts. I don't use it anymore, just tried it for a couple games, but I did look on steam powered forums, and other forums on google,...and it seems that there are TONS of people using auto hotkey in DM, CSS, and other games. <br>
And unfortunately, you can't get banned for using auto hotkey, since it does not interfere with VAC in anyway, and does not inject files or dll. into the coding.<br>
<br>
I took many months to learn my bhop, and I do have to say, there is no feeling like knowing you have achieved a personal goal, and knowing that you can finally do something you've been trying to do for so long. Bhopping can take months to acheive correctly, but when you're there, you'll have no regrets.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

To be honest, autohotkey and macro'ing/scripting jump repeaters are fully legit until measures are taken to prevent it. Why look down upon one method wen another is common(wheel).<br>

While i agree with your overall point, the above anology is terrible. If theres no one around, the stop sign is essentially meaningless, and there arent going to be any cops to ticket you either. Its akin to claiming its wrong to cheat in a single player game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

sigh.  what is so difficult to understand?  whethor space jumping or wheel jumping, the player is MANUALLY executing a PHYSICAL series of keystrokes with required coordination to get the desired affect.  <br>
<br>
does that sound like autohotkey?  macro's?  scripting?<br>
<br>
back to the car analogy.  there are still skilled drivers around that can brake their vehicle to a stop faster MANUALLY than with use of COMPUTER controlled anti-lock braking systems.  but for the the AVERAGE driver, the COMPUTER pumping the brake action is far more effective than the MANUAL pumping of the brakes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lets say i make a jump repeater macro macro, i still have to hold the button manually, so wats the diff between wheel and macro, eccept for the fact that macro is probably more efficient.<br>
And ofcourse my reasoning for this is that everyone should have to actually time their jumps, wheel is just another way around this. <br>

Well for a start the game allows for a certain amount of inputs per second, jump repeaters simply make more use of this but still actually adhere to the rules of the game. Jump repeaters at best could be called an exploit.<br>
Editing your mouse driver has nothing to do with the limitations of the game itself and any outside interference with mouse input is considered hacking/cheating?<br>

I know that the g500/g9x have the ability to freespin or wateva, also yes i am sure ppl who use the mouse wheel flick it to get about 4 or more jumps per/ I think to get it to work properly u have to set ur mouse wheel to 1 page/line each click?<br>

I would vote on election day, but I'll be working at the polls on election day making a nice chunk of change. The wait to vote has to be like 3 hours. What a waste of a saturday when I could be at home playing hl2dm or sleeping ffs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">in all seriousness, the US ought to look at the european voting model, which is have voting on saturdays and sundays. doing this would help to knock down some of the socio-economic barriers to voting, though many of the psychological barriers can't be knocked down so easily.<br>
<br>
doing this would help democrats: more of their traditional base would be able to vote; so if they were smart they would push this since this election is likely going to be a slam dunk for that party (did you know mccain only has a 5 point lead in his home state). in my district, chris shays has been in office since before i was born, and he has a real chance of losing to jim himes. in ct's 5th district last election, chris murphy beat nancy johnson who was a longtime incumbent. i did some campaign work for murphy, and i think it's pretty likely he can win again if he gets good turnout in certain areas of the district which are traditionally republican (cheshire). BUT david cappiello, his opponent, is sort of a prototype of what republicans are going to have to run as in 2012 and onward: more moderate in terms of social issues, but a savvy fiscal conservative.<br>
<br>
by 2012, obama will not be nearly as popular as he is now, and partisans like trouser snake will be yelling about getting pinko liberals out of power. i just don't think that the conditions are right for a realigning election ala 1932 or 1896. bobby jindal is pretty much the conservative response to obama, it would not shock me if he runs and wins in four years. <br>
<br>
i'd vote for a conservative who isn't too loony with religion, supports a flatter tax (both mccain's regressive and obama's steep progressive tax plans SUCK) and stops offering 20th century solutions to 21st century problems. seriously, listening to mccain is like traveling back to 1980, talking about socialism as if it's still a salient issue. the entire GOP crop sucked this year, huckabee could have been a good bet for them if he wasn't such a crazy christian. romney may also make a good candidate in 2012 if the economy still sucks. either way, republicans gotta realize that reagan is dead and they can't keep trying to make carbon copies of his policies when times and conditions have changed.<br>
<br>
either way, i'd encourage all of you to vote if you can. if you need any kind of help, calling up your local party organizations will likely give you answers to any questions you have.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
RCP is my favorite resource; it has polls from a bunch of sources and other good stuff.<br>
<br>
i think there's a pretty big chance obama is going to win, all the factors are in place. i mean just look at the map. montana and north dakota battleground states? georgia?? if mccain went into this election cycle with montana as a battleground state, he should have just conceded.<br>
<br>
only thing about this though: obama is banking on voters that traditionally don't vote. young people, in particular. especially with all these polls, people cna become complacent and decide to not vote. it'll be interesting to see how much turnout obama can get from this base which loves him so much.<br>
<br>
obama has so much money - he's shattered records, and since he opted out of public funding, he can afford to do his 30 minute infomercial on prime time TV. this is the reason he has made these states battleground states, because he can run an assload of ads in places like montana, he even was running a pretty significant amount of ads in alaska of all places. mccain's limited by public funding restrictions, so his resources are tighter and obama is forcing him to spend money in places where he shouldn't have to.<br>
<br>
obama's political machine is also pretty damn impressive. howard dean started and really mastered using the internet as a fund-raising source, and obama is really the first to harness it. we live in a youtube generation: 10 years ago 75% of the stupid shit sarah palin says at rallies for their hardcore base wouldn't have made public airwaves. but now they're all over blogs and stuff. the impressive thing is obama and his team have such a quick response to <em class="text-italics">everything</em> mccain or palin says; it's mind boggling. don't think republicans won't catch up by 2012, though.<br>
<br>
i think that four years is a pretty appropriate time. presidents need the time to get shit done. the house is designed to be that body of government which is most closely tied with the constituencies, hence the body which is up for reelection most often.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
here's the shit though, obama's not limited by public funding restrictions since he didn't opt to receive public funds. so he can spend as much of all that donation money as he wants in what states he wants while mccain can't. he can also employ more people who are more technologically savvy or just better campaigners</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Boy you really have no idea who the people are on this site, do you.  Here is some enlightenment.<br>
<br>
I am a hardworking citizen of the U.S., have a Masters degree and a full time job.  I own a house and pay a mortgage. I also pay other bills and buy gas every week.  We own a buisness that my better half runs as his full time job.  HL2DM is a hobby I enjoy in my spare time.  I care about the war, health care, the economy, keeping my job and how much money each candidate is going to take out of my hide next year.  I have voted in every election since I was 18 and I plan to vote in this one too.<br>
Oh and I am female, so internet porn is not something I do nor am I interested in.   <br>

<br>
the executive branch is just gaining more and more power every year for the last 60 years which is not how it should be.<br>
<br>
really it shouldnt matter at all who the president is. that's why we have congress and the house of representatives, the president is really only in charge of our military and navy so really, our commander and chief should be some crazy strategic war general. <br>
<br>
we need to get the power back to the ppl and not to the democratic or neoconservative party ( i say this becuase there are few republicans left with true republican mind set) <br>

i dont like obama or mccain but obama is def the less of 2 evils becuase i guess any change from the last 8 years is a good one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Obama will appoint a multi-party cabinet that will be compromised of people with little tolerance for divisiveness and partisan hackery. He will draw massive amounts of international fame and respect, the economy will go up under him, though half the reason for it will be not due to economic policy but due to the cyclicle nature of the economy. He will be tested as Biden said at least once in a foreign policy crisis, small or big, and will entrench himself with 50 advisors and come out with a sound judgement. An attempt on his life will come at least once, probably twice in his first term but secret service protection has gotten so expansive and tight there's a decent shot he'll be a second term president. Lastly, sorry guys but a graduate from Colombia University, Harvard Law School, and president of the Harvard law review is far from being just a ******.

	<div class="content">obama is sort of in a catch 22 in that regard. while i think it's pretty irresponsible, offensive even, that his campaign has pretty much alienated muslims, it's a messy situation. he made some muslims behind him at a rally who were wearing head dresses move so they wouldn't be behind him on the tv cameras. i think that's pretty low. colin powell talked about this when he supported obama on meet the press. what kind of message are we sending to muslim kids in this country? even if obama were a muslim, is there something wrong with that?<br>
<br>
but the bottom line is that there is prejudice and he has to address the issue in some way. and i think that he has taken the right approach to it in talking about his christianaity.<br>
<br>
i think that all the religious prejudice in this election is just a proxy for a real racial prejudice that's still in existence. it's just that today it's ok for people to be prejudicial against muslims but it's not ok to be prejudiced against blacks. so we see things like those bumper stickers which you saw and we have crazies like sarah palin not doing anything about people shouting "terrorist!" or "kill him!" at her rallies. to mccain's credit, he denounced someone at his rallies who said she was "afraid of obama".<br>
<br>
also there is a poll today which has obama up by 1 point in montana. i'm sorry but if the republicans are losing in montana, it's pretty much over barring osama making another appearance like he did four years ago.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

are you a woman? sorry if that's offensive somehow, but i am just wondering. my mom supports palin pretty much only because she's female.<br>
<br>
now i'm sorry, but when a vice presidential purports that "the vice president is in charge of the senate", i get a a little scared. or when a vice presidential candidate cannot identify a single newspaper which she reads. or when she claims that fruit fly research is not important and should be cut. the irony is that anyone who knows anything about biology will tell you how absolutely necessary fruit fly research is for genetic research, autism for example, and palin's kid has autism.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

gotcha, just with a handle like auntjemina...i wondered heh<br>
<br>
l2k you are right, palin's sister, heather bruce has a son with autism. mccain has said before, though, that palin, as a special needs parent, is a qualified figure on autism.<br>
<br>
well i try to read newspapers every day, but you are right that people like to read blogs and stuff for news. but i would hope that my statesmen are above that and still get their news from professionals and from different perspectives, rather than some neckbeard on the internet. how many of them actually do, i couldn't say. but i'd hope that politicians aren't reading our ramblings online (which are about as good of sources as 99% of the blogs out there) and taking them seriously.<br>
<br>
i think the point is it just made her look even worse about not really knowing anything, and when mccain's best argument is experience, her gaffes undermined that</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Most Media outlets disgust me, I think the moment I came to completely hate the media is when Mother Teresa (prolly didn't spell it right)  died. She got a lil bit of coverage but barely anything, but as soon as princess Diana died bam the whole world was covering the situation as if the world had come to a standstill. So is this world so screwed up that we honor some drunken whore over a woman who dedicated her entire life to helping people. As for Palin she has done nothing but stand up for her values and prove to me that she could stand up to the lobbyist and special interest groups and never compromise what she believes. She has good christian values, and that is what this country needs, we don't need baby killers in office. You may think that religion doesn't belong in politics, but our founding fathers said this country couldn't be ruled without the bible. Now obama says the country couldn't be ran with the bible. That man is of muslim history, went to school in a muslim based country, and had dual citzenship. I believe he will be the ultimate downfall of the ideals this country was founded on. If you work hard in life you'll be able to make a living, but with him its gonna be" if you sit on ur ass and do nothing we'll make the people that are working hard support ur pathetic ass." Sorry for the language but that philosophy unhinges me but most likely that man is gonna win and this country will cease to be a great nation.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LIfe is Life, the situation would be completely horrible I agree, however the baby is still a baby. The girl could give the child up for adoption, but by no means does the child deserve to die. Once abortion becomes acceptable by all, what next then, killing ur parents after they reach a certain age cause its just too troublesome to take care of them. Murder is wrong regardless of how you put it rape is wrong regardless of how you put it. If our justice system punished rather than babied criminals we wouldn't have rapist. This may seem extreme to you but a rapist should be executed, a murderer should be executed, a thief should have a hang cut off. If there was actual consequences for crimes there wouldn't be nearly as much crime.

We solved the abortion issue pretty simply in canada... the person whos going to be forced to carry and birth the child makes the choice. Its easy for others to look in on a situation from the outside and want to apply their various ideals to it, but the fact is, it has nothing to do with them, hence the law keeps them out of it.<br>
<br>
Also, legal abortion leading to old parents being killed...? Obviously that hasnt been the case in any pro choice country, and anyway, its hard to manage a sane comparison between a fully concious and sentient being, and an ounce of partially-developed flesh and primordial soup that lacks most/all senses or the ability to think. The majority of civilized humanity obviously sees the qualitative difference here, as abortion is legal in almost all 1st world countries.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, to say "murder is wrong regardless of the reason" then call for the government to murder murderers, doesnt work. It does show, however, that while such absolutes may look appealing in a religious text, or sound pleasing as philosophical theory, they fall flat pretty quick when faced with reality.<br>
<br>
Agree that punishment for serious crime should be much harsher though, and more fitting, though at the same time we need to see the decriminalization of pretty much everything that doesnt directly, negatively affect anyone else. Of course, beaurocratic process being the glacially slow beast that it is, i dont see either happening to a useful degree in the near future.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

for instance: marijuana <br>
<br>
Those arrested face a multitude of consequences, primarily determined by where they live. For example, most Californians charged with violating the state's pot possession laws face little more than a small fine. By contrast, getting busted with a pinch of weed in Ohio will cost you your driver's license for at least six months. Move to Texas -- well, now you're looking at a criminal record and up to 180 days in jail. Or if you happen to be a first-time offender, possibly a stint in court-mandated 'drug rehab' (one recent study reported that nearly 70 percent of all adults referred to Texas drug treatment programs for weed were referred by the courts), probation, and a hefty legal bill. And don't even think about getting busted in Oklahoma, where a first time conviction for minor pot possession can net you up to one year in jail, or up to ten years if you're found guilty of a second offense. Thinking of growing your own? That'll cost you a $20,000 fine, and -- oh yeah -- anywhere from two years to life in prison.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, some offenders do serve prison time. In fact, according to a 2006 Bureau of Justice Statistics report, 12.7 percent of state inmates and 12.4 percent of federal inmates incarcerated for drug violations are incarcerated for marijuana offenses. In human terms, this means that there are now about 33,655 state inmates and 10,785 federal inmates behind bars for violating marijuana laws. (The report failed to include estimates on the percentage of inmates incarcerated in county jails for pot-related offenses.)<br>

Okay, So by your logic, a woman in high school or college gets raped and gets pregnant. Has to freeze her studies for an unknown period of time because of it, Birth a child and then go back to school as if nothing happened? Don't think it works quite like that.<br>
<br>
Not the only example. Woman looking for a job or JUST got a dream job that she wanted gets pregnant by accident with a boyfriend or fling. By your logic she'll have to take care of the pregnancy. Which may not allow her to follow the job she really wanted. <br>
<br>
Its up to the person's choice and not what anyone OTHER than that person has to say. If they didn't plan for one than its completely up to them to choose whether to keep it or get rid of it. <br>
<br>
Same thing goes for couples. Raising a kid is not cheap and if the couple is stretching their finances enough as it is its simply too hard for them to live and deal with a child as well.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, No one has a say in the issue other than the ones directly affected by it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

3) refer to #1<br>
4) capitalism / special interests has nothing to do with this.<br>
5) while i dont like this, i dont like the "trickle down effect" or tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.<br>

your completly wrong. the right wing are trying to stick to traditional methods manily brought by a evangelical christan society, which is not the case any more. While the left wing are simply trying to provide ppl with the "freedom" they want.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">it's not called 'global warming' anymore it's called climate change.  They learned that mistake in the 70s calling it global cooling.  Call it 'global climate change' and you can blame it on anything that happens in the weather.<br>
<br>
we have only been truly recording temperature for what 100 years?  Coming out of a Small ice age from 1400 to 1800 A.D  how do we know what the real temperature is suppose to be?  We will be finished with using Gas powered vehicles before the Earth has time to blink in geological time. Kyoto is stricky designed to weaken the west when it does nothing to address any problems with China/India and other major polluting countries.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">why is the bible always blamed?  <br>
When mainly what the left is mad at is the people that claim to read the bible say things on it's behalf that aren't in it?<br>
<br>
etc<br>
<br>
If you you truly read the bible you wouldn't be trying to Force it on anyone.  Just simply life your life the right way and let people see that and make up there own minds.<br>
<br>
As in the only American that truly followed what the bible stood for and spoke publicly without forcing it on people was found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference Martin Luther King, Jr</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Good article there nino. We have similar law here in canada, but its always been restricted to absolute public use- ie, they need to put a road through your land, they pay you market value for the exact area needed for the road. The rest of your land isnt touched, and they certainly cant force sale because they want to give mcdonalds a prime spot or whatever. Sounds like owning property in america is now more akin to an indeterminate length lease where you get money back at the end... pretty sad.<br>
<br>
Also, agree with snd that religion has no place in politics. Im fine with people having imaginary friends- i had one myself until i turned 6- but damn it sucks when they try forcibly sharing them with everyone else.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Free market and prosperity will make green tech happen.  You jump to the same old conclusions thinking i am trying to push something else.  I just think it isn't proven that it isn't a natural cycle and for that matter we don't really know or have the scientific data to know what the cycle is.  Is it going to return to the tempatures from the time of the Ice ages? dinosaurs? pre-dinosaurs? what is the norm and how do/could we truly now.  All we can do is try to leave as little a foot print as possible. <br>

Ya Ko-Tao your law in canada was the status quo for quite some time but since this ruling it has expanded to yeah basically state that all land in the USA is State land and leased to people for short periods of time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Chief of Staff:  Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) - The 48-year-old Emanuel is a veteran of Bill Clinton's White House. He is among the most charismatic figures on Capitol Hill, revered by many Democrats for restoring the party's clout and loathed by some Republicans for his partisan tactics. In the multitude of Emanuel stories, one stands out: the time he boxed up a dead fish and sent it to a political foe, "Godfather"-style.<br>

I don't really know you but.......*hug*, and I agree... I'll will save my BS for the vents/scrims. Thats all I can do, change how *I* behave. Trying to change the opinions/behavior of others is difficult and, over the internet - nigh impossible. But I am empathic to dbanimal and his position, it is a common one among people here at this site, and I will try to tell people to keep it out of these forums. And tell it to myself...<br>

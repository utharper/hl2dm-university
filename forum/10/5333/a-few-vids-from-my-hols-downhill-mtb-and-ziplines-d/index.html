<br>
I was an avid bike rider (mostly bmx dirt jumping and street riding) since I could even get on a bike and I can imagine the feeling going down that hill just from watching. The flow and the adrenaline must be intense for that kind of stuff. I've never gotten the chance to do downhill like that but WOW I want to soooo bad now.<br>

	<div class="content">That zip line looks like fun.  Nice view too.  <br>
While I was watching that vid though it make me think of this time I was at a water park.  There was a set of zip lines over a giant pool.  No harness or anything like that, just grab a handle bar and ride out over the pool and drop off near the stop.  There was a bumper that would stop the pulley before you went to far, so one way or another, you were going to have to let go and drop in.  The line started on a platform that was probably 15-18 feet or so above the pool, and attendants were there to pull the pulleys back up and get the next person ready to go.  If you rode the line to the stop, the drop in was probably 4 to 5 feet above the water line.  Which is what most people did, ride until they were comfortably close to the water, then let go.<br>
So, I'm with some friends, waiting in line on another slide, and we're talking about whatthefuckever, and I'm watching people ride the zip line.  Up to the launch comes this fat chick.  Not like chubby fat, like, fat fat.  She's not that old, maybe early teens, but she's a good deuce and half.  So, I'm thinking to myself, "there's no fucking way this fatty can support her own weight."  Now, I have enough faith in the engineers of such things to allow for persons of larger proportions and well beyond, so I'm sure the cable will hold just fine, but there's no way in fuck that those chubby fingers can support her girth.  She steps up to the edge, the attendant let's her grab the handle, she leans out a bit, and she's off!  For about 2 feet anyway.  Then the reality of her decision to try this became real to the girl.  Gravity took over, and the girl fell the entire distance to the water.  It was like watching a watermelon being dropped into a pool.  The attendant had already looked away, like he never questioned the girl's upper body strength, but he apparently heard the thunderous sound which probably sounded like a killer whale doing a belly flop and nonchalantly turned, looked over the edge, waited for a bit to see if she resurfaced, then kinda shrugged and went back to his job.  At first, I just stood there with my mouth wide open for a bit.  Then, when I saw she wasn't dead, I lol'd sooooo hard.  She paddled over to the edge and grabbed on.  Apparently the swim of a whole 8 feet to the edge had exhausted her.  She had to inch her way along the edge until she got to a ladder, or steps, or whatever there was to exit.  I think it was our turn to slide, so I didn't she how she eventually got out.  The last thing I saw was her clinging to the edge while the attendant sent other riders zipping over her head.  Best water park moment ever.<br>

	<div class="content">There's a map I've been wanting to play, but I can't find it.  It was called bows and barrels.  I'm not sure of the exact spelling, but it could have been bows_n_barrels or something like that.  It was basically a small rectangular killbox with only bows, nades and barrels.  A walkway ran around the walls of the box with ramps at each corner.  There were two lifts on each half of the map.  If anyone has it, or has a link, please let me know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

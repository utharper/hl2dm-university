How about SoCal Server? When everything else is empty, its often full, and for good reason:<br>
<br>
100tick + Plugins + Lag: Yes<br>
Populated mainly by low-skill, trashtalking randoms: Yes<br>
Chance to be running dm_overwatch: 100%<br>
Chance to hear whining about rockets: 100%<br>
Likelyhood of gaining a fanclub while dominating the scoreboard: Apparently, pretty damn good!<br>
<br>
Bring your A game, because god knows, no one else will.<br>
<br>
And remember: Excuses wont make you a better player!<br>

Lol I'm not mad.  I was just kinda annoyed when this guy comes in with absolutely zero respect acting like he knows shit.  To me respect is an important thing...especially when you join a forum in which members who are very high up in the hl2dm community attend.  Pay your respect where it's due....this kid has none.<br>
<br>
And guess what happens to kid's with no respect....they end up getting smoked mad hard.  Which is obviously what is going to happen if the kid accepts joule's offer.<br>

I guess we won't agree but I don't think so.  I found his post disrespectful i.e. "better yet go to a server that is actually cool and has people playing."  That seems like an insult to me....as well as just his whole demeanor in the whole post....check his post after that...it's not like someone who has their head about them responds with "All you other fucking bastards can go to hell. Either way BAN me from here But I'll still be out there fucking kicking you sorry asses. Peace the fuck out."<br>
<br>
Honestly I don't find my post overly offensive.  Just because a post contains an explicative doesn't necessarily make it offensive.  I asked a serious question because I felt that he was out of line.  Obviously you didn't think he was, I'm not saying you are wrong, we just have a difference of opinion.  And it does piss me off when someone shows a lack of respect that I saw in his post.  Maybe you didn't see that lack of respect but I felt it was certainly there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
same thing i was thinking G, he made a good post,  asking for people for the pubs ( connect 208.122.53.215:27015 ) they play on .  Yup he called out Joule for next to nothing, let him go play joule if he wants and leave it at that.  Your post however struck me as offensive and Cocky and a open flame, which he returned by flaming.  Maybe i missed something in some other thread/post from him, but i've only seen this thread and his intro.  Not trying to rag on you G just didn't see a post like that coming from you, But thats the thing about forums you can't really tell how people are saying there words. Like did Joule mean "Oh rly, lol" or Oh Rly bitch?"<br>

Man I may agree with you more than you think. I just think "who the fuck do you think you are" is too strong of a response in this case. If you personally don't like what he said and want to take it into the game that's your decision, I am just saying this is not the place is all. I didn't appreciate his response much, but to be fair, he was provoked.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i open up the 'friends' tab to see if anyone's playing. then look in favorites and then pubs to sort by lowest ping with at least 3 players. here is sample of my DM play:<br>
<br>
yesterday i played DM for the first time in two week's, worked from home and happened to find my hidden mouse. lol <br>
<br>
so basically i had 8 hours to play while getting in a little work on the side. haha.<br>
<br>
from 7am to 9am "none of your freinds are currently playing" so i went to a ctf server with about 120 latency and that game is non stops. pisses me off when no one fucking rushes and plays sniper even when it says "this is not your sniper practice school, achive your objective".<br>
bleh, still fun though. i got to the bridge with the flag before getting killed.<br>
then i had some work to do.<br>
<br>
so around 10.30 i played agian with gSe|english on my clans newly revamped spookface. <br>
no slams and no rpg b/c too many people whore it up all day. thanks loki for doing that holmes.<br>
english if you read this stop pwning me with the crowbar! haha <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> i swear crobar has insane reach, i'm like hells no i'm so far away how did dood just hit me. death. i like the stunstick b/c it's all or nothing, not this hold down crowbar and spam me to death. i actually miss slow crowbar *ducks from the backlash* then the map changed to blast box which is fun, but the bot's submachine gun was killing me and i had to get back to work.<br>
<br>
the citrix server was getting all fucked so i thought hey, what a great excuse to get some more DM-crack in?!<br>
so back to the friends list and i see pwnsetia on a lockdown sever with low ping and i played for a while, then the map switched to aim-arena, fuck i hate that map, sigh the elevators always take health off me...don't know why but hey they just do.  then the game crashed and i need to do some more work. so another break i took.<br>
<br>
hopped on moodleweb b/c it's real low ping and the hit sound reg is money. but the competition was lacking. sorry HAL9000 while your name brings back great memories of a classic Arthur C Clarke novel and wacked out Kubrick film. i can't just kill people who duck and shoot and have not found the sprint key. i'd attempt to teach you but you didn't even respond to any of the 'hello's' so i left.<br>
<br>
so after about another two hours of work i decided to play again. and joined the HLDMU server. some dood that was all squares as a user name and i played for a few minutes. then some one named omelette du fromage joined and started pwning us. nice alias who ever that was. haha. you killed me with a insane turnaround mid-air xbow shot. a fuck you and thanks are in order haha.<br>
<br>
then back to work. then bac to the game as pigpopper was testing a new map. dood if you read this you have a sic imagination. can you makes us a real simple aim map, x-bow and mag only. PM me for a bad scematic drawring. <br>
that real little map, coalition? cognition? premanition? with the hidden weapons was good. i like smaller maps like that, lead to faster games. that killbox with the grooves in it was like an mc esher painting.<br>
-<br>
then it was time to go to class. <br>
probably won't play unless i find the new hiding spot for the mouse. <br>
<br>
but feel free to add me, <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5227203c6a226012353f333b3e7c313d3f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9eebecf0a6eeacdef9f3fff7f2b0fdf1f3">[email protected]</span></a><br>

Steam name? I'm just looking for players that STILL PLAY the game. Recently I've had nothing but spare time to play and constantly get called a HACKER and if I use BINDS to play or the most ABSURD thing I've ever heard "Play the game how it was meant to be played instead of running around and jumping and killing people". DID no one play the original? GAUS and long jumping everywhere with shotguns in full servers for HOURS. Thats when I got hooked on it and thats why I still play to this day. 10 years of half-life DM...started when I was 14 (24 now). I don't play in CAL matches or "Bunny Hop" the way its taught here. I LOVE THIS GAME and I'll be playing it until I'm dead or  wake up and there are NO servers available. Even when that happens I will start my OWN server and keep the game alive even if its just ME in there wishing people still played the game...<br>

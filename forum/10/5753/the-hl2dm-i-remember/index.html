	<div class="content">So lets Jump back 4 Years. Back in the Day were Hl2dm was still alive and thriving!<br>
<br>
  I remember the days were most of us put in hours like it was a fulltime job.  Back when Cyn, SW, 911 , DGC, Vdus ,Cartel where apart of the HL2dm world.  <br>
<br>
  I remember the first time i saw that Cyn video which was the most creative piece of work and thought i wanted to learn to play just like them.<br>
<br>
  I remember when all of us would fill a server to either scout the talent or watch a good game in progress.<br>
<br>
  I remember the days Blasphemy and I would play SW hoping to be as good as they were. We took alot of punishment but in hopes to get better at the game.<br>
<br>
  I remember when we had 80+ people on IRC talking game.<br>
<br>
  I remember when CAL was still played and people showed up for matches. <br>
<br>
  I remember seeing the 100 G tournament and all the hype behind that.<br>
<br>
  I could go on for a long time but woudlnt mind hearing some of the old stories.<br>
<br>
  <br>
  I watched this video today : <object width="320" height="265"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/7kJ2fR8KCj4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/7kJ2fR8KCj4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="320" height="265"></embed></object><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJ2fR8KCj4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Link</a><br>
<br>
  Kind of took me back  and touched my cold heart alittle hahaha<br>

<br>
Back then scrolling wasn't fixed yet and the hallways of Frenzy were a death sentence for those who were on the receiving end of the refrigerator prop.<br>
<br>
I started finding myself more and more addicted to the game until I became a regular in the server. Then came the day where all the regulars bunched up into a clan for STA, and MfYa was born. <br>
<br>
Months later Luke taught me how to bhop by chasing me around lockdown with a crowbar.<br>

<br>
I remember when the mag was the primary weapon<br>
<br>
I remember playing with Seagull in VDuS and occuring to me although he was about as good (a little worse IMO) than kurtz he still liked to score-whore at the expense of his teammates.<br>
<br>
I remember going 23-1 in FIoS and losing to some shitty kid right before the playoffs who boosted himself into the rafters to hide after going up 2-1 (score never changed for 12 minutes and ended at 2-1 with his orb spam kill).<br>
<br>
I remember PiC|Noodle and PiC| WySiWyG being as good as any 2v2 combo I've ever played against and had ridiculous xbows.<br>
<br>
I remember mentally abusing blas because I thought he had a shit ton of talent he was wasting by being scared or stupid when he first played<br>
<br>
I remember my favorite times of all in the HAX Clan server, and sucking the hell out of a ton of dicks to join hax and then getting denied by butthead, only then do become better then all of them.<br>
<br>
I remember ace blew back then, and still blows now and is gonna get raped in eFPS</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The match between seagull and lukegt was pretty great.<br>
<br>
 Does anyone remember the TWC 24/7 Lockdown days. The matches were to 50 kills,  it was a /16 slot server and was packed from sun up to sun down. Members of all Clans would usually end up on that server, you could easily pop on and see a vdus/sw/911 or any other clan member playing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol which kid? You mean the other vapor I routinely beat in 2v2's and beat in the last 1v1 we ever played? He cried for a rematch until one day he exploded with rage and deleted me from friends. One of my first days in |911| you introduced me to daedalus, so I assume you either introduced me to vdrei and got tricked yourself or that was the real one.<br>

	<div class="content">Uh, wow.<br>
<br>
- My brother and I debate between World of Warcraft and Half-Life 2 (HL2, of course. I did not understand the appeal of WoW at all.)<br>
- We decide on the G-Man cover.<br>
- Look at the inside box. omg. I even took the bind-key "manual" (it was just a piece of paper) to read while taking dumps.<br>
- The box smelled really nice too.<br>
<br>
- Half-Life 2 Single Player. Cool. Counter-Strike: Source! Awesome. Wait. What is that over there...<br>
- ...Half-Life 2: DEATHMATCH? HOLY SHIT INSTALL IMMEDIATELY.<br>
- It takes 5 minutes for me to join a 300-ping Overwatch server, and wtf, I can't move!<br>
- Okay, let's try another server. Takes 5 minutes again cause I have 256MB RAM.<br>
- OMG, THIS GAME IS AWESOME.<br>
<br>
- Hm, HL1 had bunny hop. Maybe this game has it too! Experiment with sprint + repeated jumping, oh hey! I'm going faster than normal without using much sprint! Wooh!<br>
- Pwn nubs in dm_lego pubs.<br>
- Hm, this clan (forgot the name) looks cool. Maybe I should join. (I still even remember that we were playing on some Rats map).<br>
<br>
- Wait. WTF is that. ctf_. Wait. ctf_2fort!?!? INSTA-JOIN<br>
- "Welcome to [BMC] Sniper's Playground"<br>
- HOLY SHIT IT'S TFC AND HL2DM IN ONE.<br>
- *Get out of the sniper spawn in 2fort into battlements*. Time to pwn some nubs! *Get pwnt by Skippy*<br>
- wtf. these guys are kinda good.<br>
<br>
- Regular this AWESOMENESS OF A SERVER. The one I befriend the most is someone named [BMC] Durden. He is especially impressed when he witnesses me mowing down people with the Magnum in ctf_avanti, a map in which <strong class="text-strong">you spawn with RPGs</strong>.<br>
- [HL2] Headcrab: How do you join [BMC]?<br>
- [BMC] Durden: You should probably talk to Sadistical. He's the leader, I'm sure you'd do fine in the tryouts.<br>
- I don't remember the process of getting in too well, other than the naming part. Sadistical: Dude, you're in. Okay, but we need to give you a new name...<br>
- Me: Headcrab? G-Man?<br>
- Sadistical: Nah... Hey, what about HeadJob! Cause of the Headcrab name and cause you get so many headshots. Dude, that's an awesome name! Hahaha!<br>
- [BMC] HeadJob has arrived.<br>
<br>
- And thus, perhaps the most fun part of my HL2"DM" (*coughCTFcough*) career begins. Endless pubs in CTF maps and stomps in CTF scrims.<br>
<br>
- Join STA league. Demolish the first team. I even remember one of our players, crowbar of death, using the Crowbar only the ENTIRE match and having a positive ratio. The map was on dm_steamlabs.<br>
- Then get wrecked by I think {WRW}. I think ninojman was in it. I forgot. It was on lockdown though. This was our first introduction to "wow, there are even better players and they play dm exclusively, what weirdos." Probably how the "second" generation of VDuS met the clan (Scar, Sadi, Corrosive, Me, Constipator, hopefully not forgetting anyone else...).<br>
<br>
- Disbanded into... <strong class="text-strong">Cartel</strong> (which eventually became Euro lol) and HAX (clan of the 2nd best CTF pub server, but nothing tops the Sniper's Playground with it's default settings, awesome map pool, 16-player size, and just general atmosphere).<br>
<br>
- HL2CTF... The best mod ever (but it's not HL2DM, so I won't go over that).<br>
<br>
---EDIT---<br>
- Hey Durden, when is that CTF map coming out?<br>
<br>
- Gah I forgot all about my Cartel life haha...<br>
- Christian, Bluebird, and I were the head of Cartel, of course. Always buttin' heads with each other too. I don't remember exactly why though. I was just a 12-year old punk.<br>
- And Boardingrl too. I remember Sadi left Cartel because of Christian's "unfair treatment" towards Boardingrl. Oh what drama.<br>
- I remember being immature and antagonizing Durden (who always wished for me to join HAX!) and Sadi sometime later (sorry guys! &lt;3), but we made up later, of course. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">. We lost on our rock2 scrim, but won in Warpath (I never lose in Warpath <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">).<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">- For both BMC and Cartel, I would make the most elaborate strategies, complete with MS Paint maps, routes, and all this nonsense. Oh my goodness.</strong><br>
<br>
=== Random stuff I don't remember the timeline of ===<br>
<br>
- Trollin' the {pDs} servers with Seagull, Tuna, Sadi, Scar, Con, and I (along with some others) in various ways including: teamstacking, glitching (little stuff like orbs on explosive barrels), etc. lol.<br>
- Low Budget Clan. Hell yeah.<br>
- Scrimming a bunch of Texan Cowboys or sumthin' (they had the accent and all). We would first taunt them at their own server, pretending to be complete nubs at this game. We challenge them to aim_arena, the only map that we could both agree on (they wanted to scrim on stuff like dm_killbox_omegaultra_v14). Our "scrim" exec included sv_alltalk 1. We then put on raepgamefaces and proceeded to pwn. Hilarity ensued, especially with the voice chat. "HOW ARE THEY'ALL MOVIN' SO DANG FAST" "THESE GUYS MUST BE CHEATIN'"<br>
- Making ctf_connectors_b2, ctf_revolution_b4, king_air (lol), dm_skyrun, and some troll maps. Then the endless playtests in them.<br>
- I think we had an 8v8 scrim on Avanti? It was ridiculous. Of course, I used Magnum only.<br>
<br>
- <strong class="text-strong">Edit</strong>: Seagull just reminded me of another epic story: this time taking place in a RP server. I believe it was the usual LBC group with some VDuS (Seagull, Tuna, Const, Scar, et moi). So basically, we raided a RP server and broke one fundamental rule of it: no killing. Despite our inferior weapons, we were able to score some kills, thanks to our DM skills. Oh, and when you die in an RP server, you drop money. We used that money to buy certain goodies, as you may imagine.<br>
<br>
The server was in shambles. "omfg no killing!" "WOW FUCKING FAGGOTS" "seriously you guys are gay" "STOP KILLING THIS IS RP NOT FAGGOT KILLBOX". etc. Strangely enough, there was one guy who PM'd us "dont kill me, i'll help you." Intrigued, he would ship us some goodies! RPGs, AR2, Magnum, you name it! "omfg they got guns now!" "wow killers are fucking ruining the game!" "ADMINS FUCKING BAN THEM"<br>
<br>
Of course, we weren't technically "breaking" any rules; the no-kill thing was just a matter of courtesy. You could "roleplay" as a gangster/serial killer, but you'd simply end up in jail. Eventually, the townsmen would score their lucky radiator kills or catch us with our pants down (no ammo/reloading/etc.). From here we'd get sent to jail.<br>
<br>
Except that the aforementioned helper would come in and lockpick us out of the jail. Yes, you can supposedly "buy" lockpicks and welders and crap like that! So VDuS is free once again, roaming around with Mags and the likes.<br>
<br>
The chaos ensues for another 10 or so minutes until we all die. All except for "Charles." The townsmen finally began to stick as a pack, using their superior weapons and wallets to eventually kill us. Together, they decided to escape to the roof for safety.<br>
<br>
Me: wow fking vdus fags keep killing me, where r u guyz?<br>
Townsman: follow me, we're gonna go to roof<br>
Town: NO KILLING OK GUYS?<br>
<br>
So, with some of VDuS jailed up and the townsmen finally reaching a safe  haven, the town was safe. For now.<br>
<br>
We finally reached the "roof", where everyone repeated "NO KILLING" and asked "you guyz dont have guns right?"<br>
<br>
"Nope."<br>
<br>
"cool! we're finally safe from those killfags."<br>
<br>
Little did the clumped up townsmen know that beneath my Gravity Gun, I had a RPG filled with three rockets...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
I never really tried to get too much better at this game once the CTF scene died out... And now everyone outclasses me by a large margin in this game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I during the sta days I remember going to every hl2dm server and begging ppl to join STA.  Looking for forums and posting on their also.  Talked to Sadi and Durden about joining..   wasn't there some bs about headjob dying on those forums?<br>
<br>
I remember playing you guys Sad was very surprised that it was tougher in dm then ctf.   Have the ss's on my old laptop (broken)  and the warroom database (down).   Sad and Durden joined wrw for the first season of sta Sad part time on wrw2 and durden on the main team.  Was a fun season beating every team but cyn taking them to a sudden victory.  <br>
<br>
With guys like BonelesS another crazy good Canadian that would hang with kurtz and all the top players of the time without knowing how to bhop.  His best weapon was the stun stick or lighting penis as he called it.  <br>
<br>
remember hanging with the leaders of {SW} atl, [TMx] Drunk Rick in IRC mornings at work drinking coffee shotting the shit.  Trying to find other clans to join STA to make it better.  Talking to Dallas about getting 911 to join forever.  Same with DGC,  TNE (the Christian hl2dm clan lol pern! should join).  Countless others that either joined for 1 week got raped and left or teams like [FF] which i first posted about joining sta in 05 and they finally joined cal in 08.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not headjob (that's me!) but Crowbar of Death, yeah.<br>
<br>
In retrospect, I think he was just a little kid who just played for the lulz. His "friend" who was informing us of his "death" told us his real name to be Logan, that he specialized in weapons dealing with close quarters combats, and various other uncannily Wolverine-like details. His "professional" e-mail was like <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c1f1d0a19111d124e484e483c051d141313521f1311"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="46252730232b272874727472063f272e29296825292b">[email protected]</span></a> or something. At any rate, it's quite amusing, and very akin to what he'd do (besides only crowbarring in an actual scrim).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">this was my first online game. <br>
<br>
joined a sniper clan. (still one of the best tags evah imho  {=xXx=} x-gamers<br>
<br>
spent two years playing with no rpg, no headshots, and banning bhoppers.  i didn't know any better.<br>
<br>
tried to improve enough to join our clans "elite" team which scrimmed other clans.  became disgusted with the ROE we would stipulate just to scrim.  this map, no rpg, no bhopping, blah, blah, blah.  then watched as the elite group divided the clan and lead to its eventual destruction. <br>
<br>
learned about the U from Neo, who would frequently visit our servers and rape us all.  began exploring other servers and would frequent a canadian server (someone knows this server name but i forget) that seagull used to visit a lot.  i could never get seagull to talk or give tips/advice.  but the other players on this server would never stfu!  lol.<br>
<br>
joined khaos to try to improve and get into the competitive stuff.  had to learn to use the rpg, magnum and bhop.  watched as khaos developed into a competitive and pub clan.  mix in some paradox, rachkir, vapor, mutant, cold fusion, edge, divinity, reverend, darkology and voz.... rinse/lather/repeat... implosion.<br>
<br>
tried my hand as a CAL admin.  realized that all the fucking drama about league fixing was a bunch of bullshit.  the truth is that the league was just very poorly managed.  but i had some fun banning retards.<br>
<br>
spent some time defending rev, dark, and voz against hacking allegations.  rev manned up.  not dark or voz.  and i deeply regret my support for them.<br>
<br>
reviewed the controversial CAL hacking allegation against Grain.  i think i was only CAL admin to take the review serious enough to write up my detailed justification exonerating Grain.<br>
<br>
reviewed "admitted" hackers demo's and began to understand just how difficult it really is to "prove" cheats.  watched first hand as "admitted" scripters demonstrated on unprotected servers the evils of lua.<br>
<br>
happy as a clam to be grandfathered into Synergy.  convinced that everyone hacks.  not really giving a shit anymore.  enjoying myself while pubbing a variety of servers and playing the occasional scrims.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I remember being a ctf noob when i first started. I loved playing the {pDs} and hax server. I think [VDuS] was the only top tier dm clan to play ctf and it is when i first saw how skilfully the game could be played.<br>
<br>
I remember getting kicked out of {pDs} because i shared an account with my brother who was in |Nookie| and they were a rival clan.<br>
<br>
I remember trying to join haxl, but getting turned down and joining [PBS] Professional Bitch Slappers. PBS is when i first met my online boyfriend vals and the rest is history. &lt;3 <br>
<br>
I remember seremaya, aoreli, mr bojangles, titsmcgee who were in PBS.<br>
<br>
I remember when the hax server still had the tfc mod. Ninja was the best class, smoke nades and invisibility.<br>
<br>
I remember Scar back when he was named The Godfather showing me a thing or two.<br>
<br>
I remember when i wanted to start playing dm competitively after the ctf scene died out.<br>
<br>
I remember looking at all the dm clans trying to find one that might recruit me. I decided I might have a shot of joining {DGC}. I then started jocking on invx and lunatic/calms dicks<br>
<br>
I remember joining {DGC} and fios starting shortly after that.<br>
<br>
I remember getting the "can't touch this" streak kill on the 911 lockdown server with kurtz playing. <br>
<br>
I remember becoming friends with stinky who was invx brother.<br>
<br>
I remember stinky pretty much being the only reason i became half decent at this game.<br>
<br>
I remember when me and ace beat $W and VDuS in the same day.<br>
<br>
I remember scrimming for hours on end with ace, invx and vals and i can honestly say that was the best time i had playing this game.<br>
<br>
I remember UG, which had some of the best players in the game, teto, invx, ace, stinky, vals, bahlk, hidden and myself.<br>
<br>
I remember becoming pals with bahlk who could on any given day be the worst or best player in this game.<br>
<br>
I remember meeting up with bahlk on 3 separate occasions, one of them involving myself blacking out and getting kicked out of a casino.<br>
<br>
I remember winning CU NA and thinking that finally after about 5 years I finally beat $W in a league match.<br>
<br>
I remember how i still rape with orbs. Get at me  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
In 2v2 I think grain/billy can still keep up with anyone but aren't unbeatable anymore, in 3v3 they are missing a solid third. The style they revolutionized was caught up to (now everyone uses a power shotty and more nades) and the maps they used they used which were once unpopular become popular (caverns, LA), thus why they are not as unbeatable as before. Although Grain's mag aim is still one of the best to touch the game and PB definately took the shotgun to the next level and made it the games new primary weapon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well when you throw up comments like "ewr was the best ever" its hard to not keep it up <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
<br>
As a person who got to witness cyn around their peak their team work was impeccable, and IMO still holds the crown for the best group of players the game has ever seen. Mertz had a better mag than you and kurtz had a better bow/equal mag to anyone in the game. In fact if mertz never sent me his POV game of him getting 40 mag kills in one round I would've thought he was using a toggle aimbot.<br>
<br>
Well hey, my above comment still relates to the "game I remember" amirite?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
You never beat ANYONE good in a 1vs1. enough said with that. <br>
<br>
You finally now claim to beat sw and all the people that never play anymore. get the fuck outta here! of course your gonna win a game that maybe nutri poorbilly seagull lukegt and everyone else only play maybe a couple hours every month. When all the greats played everyday and practiced we were untouchable, you were crying on the sidelines saying how great you were and how everyone sucks yet you showed no skill.<br>
<br>
You claim now that your better then everyone who dont care about the game. People lose skill when they dont put in the hours doesnt mean your all of a sudden better than everyone.<br>
Everyone that was a legend who basically dropped the game lost there skill. Kurtz, lukegt, Seagull, pb, nutri whoever else. it takes time and practice. <br>
<br>
Saying you did something i never did. well heres the hl2dm i remember-<br>
<br>
-I remember coming in 2nd in cal 2 vs 2, conflict and i had a great chance at winning it. Conflict is a great player yet somehow he froze up in  the game, we had a huge shot at winning it.<br>
-I remember making money playing this game placing 1st in tournament.com. I was 2nd place in all 3 games. (DOD:S. Hld2m. and CSS) out of over 6,000 ppl in all those games. I made over 2 grand.<br>
- I remember having a shot at winning the cal 1 vs 1 only to give it up to embarrass lukegt. PB and i had a reg season game. I won the first, He won the 2nd. And the 3rd game he won by 1 frag. Then we had another season game and he was smart and chose tigrick a map i never practice and womped on me. hats off to pb.<br>
-I remember never losing to anyone in kbh 1vs 1 and when the server was full. i think only the big cheese was close to taking me out.<br>
- I remember beating everyone in a 1 vs 1 at least a few times, i didnt consider myself to be the best player just worthy to compete with the best. I have beat everyone in the game but in total does not mean im better. i got womped on a few times by lukegt nurti and pb but i have also beat them too. <br>
<br>
-I remember being ace and bringing the life to half life deathmatch <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
Ps that comment about cyn is like saying that all the UFC legends from the first 10 ufc events are the best ever. The game was in development, i garantee if they put in the time to get good again, they would be no better then the legends i mentioned in the other post.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When did I ever say I was better than anyone else, care to find that? I did change completely as a player, I gave up my magnum because I knew I would never get it back after the update, stopped playing passive and became aggressive and smart, focusing on shotty/mag and controlling the map. Anyone who has played with me or against me can say that I've become a different player.<br>
<br>
Secondly I don't like 1v1's and never do them, I don't see your point.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I enjoyed the 1v1s we did and trying to beat you and the good sportsmanship you showed when I would rarely beat u or come close/tie you. I can't deny 1v1ing you in the past has made me a better player or helped me become better. <br>

Well since I have to qualify myself with 1v1's I beat Seagull, bahlk, blas, you (in our last 1v1 on LA), vapor and lost to lukeGT by 1 kill and PB by 2 kills the last time I played them. Happy? Like really I don't give a shit about 1v1, I like team games.<br>

Good idea Val, that way you'll have a nice excuse to fall back on when you get stomped.<br>

Why don't you people just boot up the game and play a few pugs? I mean, you're probably already playing on alias accounts. They can't ALL be newguy's... <br>

	<div class="content">Its funny to see people arguing about being "best" or who was "best" or who lost to who. Losing is part of the game, its what strives to make people better...<br>
<br>
Anyways what I remember for this game was probably my firsts days of trying to get better. Fucking DRAFT NIGHT with Nino! Man, that first night we played was an eye opener for me.<br>
<br>
I couldn't believe the skill level after seen DEFme playing... then I started trying to get better. Lots of losing in there lol. Part of getting better I guess? Then I think it was Season 4 nino put me in WRW2 with Voxtex. Shit was funny, first time playing in the league with anyone on that team, I believe it was P!KE, Paradox, Vox, Myself, Penginuo and one other guy, maybe Stretch? We didn't do bad for the first time.<br>
<br>
After that I joined up with Khaos and tried to get good haha. Played with Div in lots of 1v1's... helped me get a bit better, at least make less mistakes. Then I started playing against the top players, like Luke. Khaos fell apart due to a few select people and the whole "LETS BE A COMPETITIVE PUB CLAN!" attitude. We then formed Synergy... epic.<br>
<br>
I remember going to the semi finals in the 2v2 cup, thats about it for Synergy haha. <br>
<br>
Its been fun though.<br>
<br>
Lets play some 1v1's 2v2's 3v3's?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Half-Life 2: Electric Boogaloo is an overrated first-person shooter developed by Valve Corporation, that won over 40 Game of the Year awards. It is mostly used as a platform for socially-stunted gamers to play Counter-Strike.<br>
<br>
The game is based on the adventures of a cardboard cut-out named Gordon Freeman. After the events of the first game, Gordon Freeman was kidnapped, teleported thousands of years back in time and raped in oblivion for at least 100 years by G-man, and then somehow ended up on a train heading for City 17. City 17 and the entire world are controlled Dr.Br33n, a local pedophile and war-monger. He spends his days blabbing about shit on giant screens, eating the flesh of his enemies, and rounding up all the kids in the world to his secret lair (ergo there are no children in the game). Gordon then gets kidnapped by an alcoholic and is subjected into revolting against the relatively peaceful regime. He goes on an adventure for 2 days, meeting Morgan Freeman and his half-black daughter, psychotic fundamentalists, English buccaneers, and eventually goes back to City 17 and pwns Br33n's sorry ass. Unfortunately, G-man (who had been stalking Gordon for the entire game) captures him again and the game ends. Wow, that shit is so profound.<br>
<br>
Here's the progression of the game: you start off with an actually pretty neat walk through Shitty 17, and then a little while later you're in a sewer for over an hour. Then you have to ride a hovercraft and you're like "Wow, coolness! Thank Jesus fucking Mary Magdalene on a bed made out of win I'm out of those fucking sewers!" And it almost immediately gets old, then you proceed to ride the hovercraft around for a million fucking years. Repeat formula for the rest of the game: 10 minutes of cool shit followed by 3 hours of boring shit until the typically anticlimactic shit ending.<br>
<br>
Half-Life 2 pioneered new, groundbreaking storytelling technique. Rather than making you sit around doing jack shit during overlong, shitty cutscenes, the game lets you walk around during overlong, shitty cutscenes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
<br>
What I do remember (~ 4 or 5 years ago ?) :<br>
<br>
- My team (P!raT) sharing servers with HxC (another french team) because we had more players than avalaible slots on our respective servers.<br>
<br>
- <strong class="text-strong">Playing matches in 5v5</strong> (and not 2v2 like today)<br>
<br>
- Joining fun servers with a lot of musics and stupid sounds<br>
<br>
- <strong class="text-strong">Joining sv_pure 0 servers with custom colored models and custom colored weapons</strong> (well sv_pure didnt not exist yet)<br>
<br>
- Training nights to learn how to move (bhop, strafejump) on this game<br>
<br>
- Playing nights with the physic : mountain of boxes, grav jumps, etc...<br>
<br>
- Speaking with nice people from other european countries (germany, spain) all night long x) (in HL1 I was playing only on LAN with french buddies)<br>
<br>
- Trying to jump the lockdown jump to the 200 and the lostvillage jump from the container (like everybody  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> )<br>
<br>
- Chatting by changing our nicknames when there was the steam bug which prevented people to chat ingame for weeks and weeks for all HL2 players. (Steam community chat with SHIFT+TAB didnt exist iirc)<br>
<br>
- Doing some stupid stuff with sv_cheats 1 (like spawning antlions, vortigaunts or striders in middle of a fun match being spectator xD)<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are a lot of other stuff but that's the main memories I wanted to remember and share with you  :p<br>

	<div class="content">i got a warzed HL2 from a friend at work who laughed at me for playing UT2K4 for the longest time. I was stunned by the games' story and visuals (and still am to this day)  and as soon as i finished it i want to a local store and got it for about $40 at the time.<br>
I want home and launched DM and basically got a good scare from watching what was then in my eyes the intense and chaotic gameplay. I closed off and didnt care open the game again for a couple of weeks lol. Played some css for a while until i mustered the courage to try dm again...came upon quicksilver's Spookface server and fell right inlove. I probably stuck with that server for the better part of 05, with the odd peek into Gdawgg's servers for a lot of pure fun playing with tons of ppl for nights on end. Gdawgg was also where i met Loki with whome i opened the EYE clan. I remember opening Hammer for the very first time back in late 06 and bugging the fuck out of the coolest people like quick,  superhebbe,  I, funfun oscar and many poor bast over at Interlopers.<br>
I remember playing for whole days literaly. Remember being able to map something and looking at it with pride think i got it right. Silly bast lol.<br>
Ahhh fun times.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">"Valiums you forgot to put "Think" in your post!!! Why dont you "THINK" for a second what your saying."<br>
<br>
Please use "you are" or "you're".<br>
<br>
Also, use an apostrophe after Valiums and use the proper contraction for do not, which is don't.<br>
<br>
As a practical literary matter "Why don't you "THINK" for a second what you're saying." is weird and clunky, lacking any elegance.<br>
Maybe "Why don't you take a second to think about what are saying." is better.<br>
<br>
Now, back to which one of you is the biggest idiot.<br>
<br>
Always glad to help.<br>

Edit: OMG! FFS Ace!<br>
<br>
"I do however wake up and ....shit. Ill tell you one thing tho vals... When i beat you in the match...i own your soul."<br>
<br>
However is unnecessary.<br>
An ellipsis requires three marks, like this...<br>
It is I'll.<br>
Though is spelled though.<br>
<br>
"When i beat you in the match...i own your soul."<br>
<br>
This sentence is bullshit. It sucks. Your (YOUR) participles are dangling and this nonsense isn't even connected.<br>
Owning his soul isn't even dependent on winning in this match, you lunkhead.<br>
"Beating [When!? Well, the match will be played when it happens...duh! You mean If!? Are you saying you will be owning his soul WHEN you are beating him!? WTF!] you in the match...I own your soul.<br>
<br>
A pathetic sentence. A real loser.<br>

May a honey badger tip over your trash nightly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Please use "you are" or "you're".<br>

Also, use an apostrophe after Valiums and use the proper contraction for do not, which is don't.<br>
<br>
As a practical literary matter "Why don't you "THINK" for a second what you're saying." is weird and clunky, lacking any elegance.<br>

Jeez, i must have missed this post. Sorry.<br>
<br>
I never said you should respect anything i say.<br>
If you're asking why i don't, i don't feel like it.<br>
What am i doing to prevent all what!?<br>
I haven't a clue what you are talking about. Prevent what? I like to stir it up, not prevent.<br>
<br>
Nothing i posted is rhetoric. Rhetoric has to do with speechifying, using language to persuasive effect.<br>
All i did was have fun with your lousy education.<br>
<br>
I like GUBBMINT. It's shorter, easier to type, and contains it's own derisive tone about government.<br>
<br>
And please, no Prison Planet/Bilderberg/911Truth/Tri-Lateral Commission/Federal Reserve/Roswell Aliens shit, please.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yeah i think we ran into each other in... the Garden of Weeden? bongloader was testing this pretty retarded map i think? what was that clans name? i swear it had something to do with drums.. but i'm high.<br>
<br>
you were the shit though, first skilled player i ran across who wasn't a total pole smoker. No idea what inspired the redlight name, idk if i ever knew really. I was getting sick of counter strike and instead of getting rid of reRE we merged with them and i started an hl2dm division. Our first night we tried to scrim SW and we went on for about 2 hours talking shit because they swore up and down havoc and i were aliases.<br>
<br>
that just reminded me of everything awall, good fucking times man.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is another mod out now that is free for UT3 called the hunted and basically it looks sort of the same thing. Just Dl'd it and gonna give it a go to see how it is, would expect it to be even better considering its the UT3 engine and possibly is physx capable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

nino, if you're referring to the killing floor then you're wrong. it's a UT2K4 based mod and this is also the reason it looks so poor. <br>
I agree with you BlackRaven, i wouldn't spend a dime on this.<br>
UT2K4 was the first game i ever played, like you chem, and it has a warm place in my heart sort of speak but i wouldn't be spending money on anything made on such outdated engine today. I'd just play UT2K4 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
If you ask me, L4D pretty much topped all zombie games ever made and I would hope to not see another game / mod about zombies. L4D delivers it just fine and anything beyond / other than it would be, IMHO, overused and boring.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">so ya couple months ago w/ all the crazy shotgun business, and i was starting to be cal admin and i just heard about this "no spread" hack option which i never heard of before ( couple of ppl like zman, and luke prob remember me asking them if they have heard about no spread and wat not) so ya i went and dl'ed the first no spread hack thing and logged in using the free account i made like a year ago. so i went in and mainly messed around in a server i created but couldn't really tell if i was doing ne thing... ( lol i have no clue w/ it comes to scripts and hacks and wat not ) joined a server dicked around w/ that shit and couldnt really figure any thing else so i left and deleted everything and reinstalled and watnot, suprizngly the account wasnt vaced while i was playing (naturally assuming i would get vaced) but was vaced next time i went into that account. so ya.. it wasnt really a big deal because i figured no one would find out lol... untill i realized tonite when trying to set up 1v1 match w/ some css dude and wasnt sure of my account name ( its <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3c1d2c9c9d1d6c1c1cac3dad6f3dbdcc7ded2dadf9dd0dcde"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="addfccd7d7cfc8dfdfd4ddc4c8edc5c2d9c0ccc4c183cec2c0">[emailÂ protected]</span></a> , lol long story ) so i told him to just add bahlk... and wasnt too sure, and he asked me if i was "wee" and i loled so ya.. then i was like well if anyone tries to add me by bahlk they will find a hacker (and how many bahlks could there possible be in all of steam...) so hahaha ya ill prob be deamed the new slickfro and wat not and prob get kicked from cal but i figured i would just come by and say instead of someone trying to add bahlk and see. and wats funny is thats partly why when i was adding ppl back and telling them i got vaced was so funny and some ppl like teto actually thought i did.. even tho theres only one account i ever use while playing dm (0:1:256864) but ya..<br>

	<div class="content">edit: to deleted post saying "why would you tell ppl this"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
because like i said, untill tonite i didnt even realize that if someone were to try and add me to friends by putting "bahlk" in the add friends thing instead of doing it threw in game, they would find a hacker, and like i said how many bahlks in steam could there possible be, that play dm.... so i figured i would try and save face? before something happened? like someone adds me that way? idk w.e i realize by doing this i prob will hate playing and prob stop playing soon but w.e once a hacker allways a hacker right..<br>
<br>
ima just say one more thing but its kind of an asshole thing but w.e im not gonna say names, but i know an 2 $w members ( i think only one of them were using hacks) to test them out and shit and told me about it and then telling me couple months later that he finally just got vaced, but of course thats totally diff, right?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

On topic, I have tried many hacks over time on my current account.  For some reason never vac banned.  I do it to see if I could detect them in a plugin, but only aimbots can be.

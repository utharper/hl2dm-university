I think the new hall is win.<br>
<br>
It's not like flas totally merged w/ $W, 2 of them went to 2 diff clans and 1 of em is in the recruitment office asking any clan/team if they want him. <br>
<br>
Some people just don't like to lose or get beaten so badly so they don't play. This game is aging and people are just moving on to other games. Shit don't stay appealing to people for long,  they will get bored. <br>
<br>
For me I whore this game cuz I simply don't want to get into other games cuz either my pc is too slow for those newer, sexier looking games, or I just don't want to spend the money on those games people are telling me I need to play (tf2, l4d, etc) cuz money's tight and I don't have the time I used to have to get into another game AND I still enjoy playing this game weather it be killboxing kbh style or scrimming in some locked server.<br>
<br>
Newer maps are slowly getting into cal. It's good to see caverns and milieu in and others should be considered as well. I agree with conflict, f*ck the authors, revise other maps w/o permission if the author isnt' around who gives a damn and if he says no do it anyway I doubt they play this game to find out and bitch anyway. Oh yeah rotate those cal maps already!<br>

	<div class="content">well I can't comment much on CAL thing since it none of my business how you guys run things down your end but I can understand what has been said.<br>
<br>
On the draft night I think many took it for granted and never realised how much effort and sacrifice was done by the people like Nino. I ran a draft down my end but soon realised people took the piss and turned up late and just made things difficult I soon gave up on that and now I get people asking me to bring it back and I simply got rl things to do and got little time now. Im sure that how it is for Nino. But one thing where gamers we are lazy by nature so it is no surprise that no one has stepped up to the plate to organise it and one can argue do the community deserve it  for one to use up there time for them.<br>
<br>
Team stacking well I can see how this can be annoying. But this is evitable u can't really stop it people want to play with the best and is just part of trust for winning easy. As what i could control I try not take players from other clans I kinda feel it kills competitiveness of the game. But mainly pick guys on their personality than their skill which can be taught.   <br>
<br>
On rates well this game has awful net code the stock settings for client make this even worse. Rate only way to get no choke for some of us and make it playable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
This so-called "we don't want DM to die" thing has lasted long enough and i can't stand it anymore.<br>
<br>
After the matter being discussed i officially leave sw as i am agaisnt the recent politics of stacking players so they don't join other clans *cough* ewr<br>
<br>
<br>
If you truly love this game and what it to expand:<br>
<br>
STOP TEAM STACKING, back in the old days every team had their "hero" and it worked geat, now everyone is in vdus / sw/ ewr and it's fucking lame, wich leads me to CAL<br>
<br>
<br>
CAL and it's map rotation is a complete "fuck you" to this community. <br>
Why on earth is lockdown played during a season AND it's the tiebreaker AND it's the final map.<br>
<br>
WHY IS IT STILL AROUND!?!? we have a bunch of highly talented mappers, a bunch of people who'd want to see lockdown die in a hole, but no, we're stuck with it, not twice but possibly 3 times during a single season. wow?<br>
<br>
r5, are you kidding me, if it was really all about stopping people from speedcrouching to rpg.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">MAKE A CAL RULE ABOUT SPEED CROUCHING.</strong><br>
<br>
hot-damn, it's that simple, it's the only map where it's a problem, just make it illegal, bam.<br>
<br>
People have been whining for quite a time about people messing up with their rates and all that stuff, nowadays EVERYONE uses broadband connection, <br>
<strong class="text-strong">make CAL.cfg force CAL RATES // develop a plugin that forces people on x server to use x rates.</strong><br>
<br>
Bam no more whining.<br>
<br>
<br>
CAL shouldnt be taken too seriously it's only killing this game more and more.<br>
<br>
Bring the Draft Nights back, there's much simpler ways than making everyone wait five hundred years in the vent server and it was really THIS ONE THING that keep people interested in playing because you get to know people and play with people you might've never played with/agaisnt.<br>
<br>
If the people are really all about saving this game's ass stop dicking around and move things around.<br>
<br>
AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, if you guys wants a lostvillage revision, just do it, will you seriously wait until it's creator to comeback from his years of AFKness?<br>
<br>
1) you're all illegally download files etc this isnt different<br>
2) no one will get sued<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway i'm done, i won't play CAL this season, don't ask me to join a team.<br>
<br>
But hey good day and i love you and all  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>

and why does this game have a 4v4 division? I mean there's really no strategy in a 4v4 only spam, Oh wait, spamming is only what some people can do. 1v1, 2v2 are good. 3v3 is ok but 4v4.... <br>

or they get bored of the same maps played again and again, a fucking 4v4 for this game in CAL and the constant whining like "Omg orb went through u, zomg I headshoted you, mag and shotgun hit and you still didnt die".<br>
<br>
The only teams I have played that didnt whine have to be Khaos, ewr, sw (before confused) and elite. GGs guys.<br>

we dont really have this problem in europe so its probably not inevitable. we could easily form a 3v3 team that would probably be unbeatable but people decided to stay around their friends so while there are conflicts in the community, the real big players have been in their clans for a long time. like warloxt, could you imagine him in a clan other than es? <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> es lost all its important matches this season and theyre still together.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its a damn shame that when Zman had to quti playing for a while, the rest of FLaS bailed out faster than a horse out of a burning barn.   If they had just stuck it out, FLaS would have survived and still be here.  Once Confused joined $W I knew FLaS was gone for good because if you still wanted to play this game, why the hell would you quti $W once you were there.  They are the quintessential L33T clan, eveyone always dreams of being $W....lol.  When Zman came back, there really was no other place for him, except $W because Confused was there.<br>
<br>
IMO once clans do get large enough, if they get large enough, they should add more teams instead of putting everyone on one team.  At least in that way we do get more teams and more people playing.  EE and Khaos made a combined open team for some of our players that are new to competative play so that they can learn how to play CAL.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Team Stacking</strong>: The simple, effective answer is to enforce a roster limit in cal (and in any other leagues that spring up). 8 max for 4v4, 2 max for 2v2 (yes, 2 [two], its not hard to sync times with 1 other player and the vast majority of teams use the same 2 players in every match anyway). This would greatly increase the team count as well; instead of 20 players on a single 2v2 team, youd potentially have 10 teams of varying strengths and styles.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Lockdown</strong>: Yes, its time to let it die. A prop-choked, hugely spam-biased converted single player map designed for 16 man pubs hardly has a place in a competitive league, especially considering the numerous competition-designed maps available as alternatives. If its going to remain, for whatever reason, clip and bugfix the original and then just leave it be. The euros manage to tolerate speedcrawling, so im sure we can get used to it as well- random map specific rules are a bad idea. Speaking of which...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Lostvillage</strong>: Its time to let this die too. Numerous cheesy camp spots, free wallhax thru nodraw in various locations, props that have a 10 minute respawn timer (lol), and broken secret rooms that make new players ragequit when enemy teams camp in them, or require special rules of their own since they can be used to wait out the entire match. The maps also never going to be fixed- i think at this point its pretty certain that wolf is gone forever, and cal isnt about to start violating mappers copyright, certainly not to keep such a generic map around long after its time has passed.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Aim Arena</strong>: Deserves mention as well, for the similar reason as ld- it wasnt designed for 1v1 play, and excessively rewards aim/movement over prediction/tactics. We now have a fine selection of small 1v1 specific maps that test both sets of skills roughly equally, or allow both to be used to strong effect; let the old practice and pub maps rest and put those new competition spec maps to use.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Rates</strong>: The cal.cfg already forces rates within specific parameters. Keep in mind, someone on a bad connection is not going to want to be forced to 66/66/30000, and have to play the entire match with 100+ choke. Also, the vast majority of skipping/jittering players we see are likely on wireless, and theres not a damn thing the cal.cfg can do about that.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Draft Night</strong>: Sure, this was fun stuff (sometimes) and  generally good for the community, but its not like it died because no one ever played. Someone has to run it, time / effort / commitment etc, and apparently theres no one willing to do so atm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You make us a competitive team when you play and give us another player when we have others that are not able to play. I personally dont mind when good players join say sw or ewr. The reason being, most of them are not as good as the team already assembled and if they get a chance to play that team is more liable to lose. The thing that bothers me is that competition goes down the shitter since there are 8 available guys on a really good team and only 4 can play. I dont care if the same team wins every year, what I care about is lack of overall teams playing. Just take a look at the last week for 2v2 and 4v4 in CAL. Forfeit wins out the wazoo. We have a large roster, but 75% of the time 80% of our roster cant play and it is always a different 80%. This is the first season that we have actually not had many issues with having available players for each match.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

maybe i should put my input into this thread, hmmm lets see why do people that are already good don't join lesser clans, maybe because they have already put so much time into the game that its not worth having to carry a team thats still gonna lose most of the time, I know the only reason i joined ewr is because invx and stinky don't play anymore so i had no one to play with, if they where still around i know i wouldn't be in ewr no offense clan m8's.<br>
<br>
I don't even really care about CAL, i have already lost and won against all the top clans, without having to wait 8 weeks to play them.</div>

You can't disagree with a fact. The fact is: in Europe SOME clans are divided by their Country and/or Language. in America they are not.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Oh, and how long have I been saying that lockdown is a piece of junk?  Since I started playing this game.  Back then we had to play lockdown because we didn't have a choice.  There were only a handful of decent CAL maps, but now with all the new maps coming out (including maps from Abnokious - some of you may not have heard of him, but he has made the map Rapidfire which is amazing.  It should be in CAL no doubt, but guess who wanted it changed?  Fearsome.  He wanted one speed tunnel to the rpg area intsead of two, which would turn a well rounded, and spectacular map into another camp the rpg area map.  It's a damn shame.  If any of you want to try out rapidfire, I'll post a download link to it.  Oh and also, Abnokious has a new map in the works, one that blows my mind) lockdown isn't needed.  We as a community have to stand up for our new maps, our new map makers, and ourselves by getting rid of lockdown.  Just because you know lockdown better than any other map, that doesn't mean that it should stay in CAL.  Give these new maps a chance before you run back to little old Lockdown.</div></blockquote>

I'll gladly play rapidfire, as well as any other well made maps.<br>

I agree, also one. was a spectacular clan.<br>
<br>
Regardless if lockdown is gonna stay in CAL Arm also redid that map, put new textures in it so it looks just as pretty as the lostvillage that he made and clipped the rails and fixed fps issues. As I recall he even left the hallway that Fearsome put in, because he knew someone would bitch. <br>
That's also another option, so you don't get caught on shit when your going down hallways and people with lower end systems don't have the gawd awful fps problem when running poorly implemented hdr. <br>
A lot of the issues with these older maps that you people mention have been fixed and the maps themselves beautified, but we have people bitching about how we need to get the rights to remake the map... I think they would be happy that their map is still implemented in game and that it was perfected, because Ive seen a lot of dumbed down versions too that are disgusting.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Uh...maybe I should explain since you don't seem to understand.  This is 2009 and I'm not talking about cyn.  If FIOS was to take place this year (2009, again, just to make sure we understand what year it is), things would be different.<br>

<br>
there's nothing necessarily BAD about lockdown, people just don't like close-quarters maps like that anymore, the game is slowly shifting to other playstyles I'm guessing so it's getting a bit stale. That said, it's easily the best map in terms of strategy for 1v1/2v2 when I was playing, the amount of potential it has is absolutely ridiculous</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

if you're gonna cut lockdown you're also going to have to cut every other shitty map like ko-tao said, which chances are is going to be some maps that people absolutely &lt;3, and no one is gonna want to sacrifice their favorite map (which is probably extremely shitty) just so lockdown isn't around anymore.

<br>
maybe i should put my input into this thread, hmmm lets see why do people that are already good don't join lesser clans, maybe because they have already put so much time into the game that its not worth having to carry a team thats still gonna lose most of the time, I know the only reason i joined ewr is because invx and stinky don't play anymore so i had no one to play with, if they where still around i know i wouldn't be in ewr no offense clan m8's.<br>
<br>
I don't even really care about CAL, i have already lost and won against all the top clans, without having to wait 8 weeks to play them.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Well I'm sure ewR wouldnt mind too much if you left. They let you in cause they felt bad all your fwends abandoned you and you were lonely wonewy. Plus your fun in vent, other then that not really sure why they let you in. OH and P.S. I was kind of hungry for a cookie, can anyone spare a brotha??<br>

EDIT jeez I was joking on why they let blas in, already getting people messaging me like wtf?</div></blockquote>yea bro don't make me let my mob loose on you.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This so-called "we don't want DM to die" thing has lasted long enough and i can't stand it anymore.<br>
<br>
After the matter being discussed i officially leave sw as i am agaisnt the recent politics of stacking players so they don't join other clans *cough* ewr<br>
<br>
<br>
If you truly love this game and what it to expand:<br>
<br>
STOP TEAM STACKING, back in the old days every team had their "hero" and it worked geat, now everyone is in vdus / sw/ ewr and it's fucking lame, wich leads me to CAL<br>
<br>
<br>
CAL and it's map rotation is a complete "fuck you" to this community. <br>
Why on earth is lockdown played during a season AND it's the tiebreaker AND it's the final map.<br>
<br>
WHY IS IT STILL AROUND!?!? we have a bunch of highly talented mappers, a bunch of people who'd want to see lockdown die in a hole, but no, we're stuck with it, not twice but possibly 3 times during a single season. wow?<br>
<br>
r5, are you kidding me, if it was really all about stopping people from speedcrouching to rpg.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">MAKE A CAL RULE ABOUT SPEED CROUCHING.</strong><br>
<br>
hot-damn, it's that simple, it's the only map where it's a problem, just make it illegal, bam.<br>
<br>
People have been whining for quite a time about people messing up with their rates and all that stuff, nowadays EVERYONE uses broadband connection, <br>
<strong class="text-strong">make CAL.cfg force CAL RATES // develop a plugin that forces people on x server to use x rates.</strong><br>
<br>
Bam no more whining.<br>
<br>
<br>
CAL shouldnt be taken too seriously it's only killing this game more and more.<br>
<br>
Bring the Draft Nights back, there's much simpler ways than making everyone wait five hundred years in the vent server and it was really THIS ONE THING that keep people interested in playing because you get to know people and play with people you might've never played with/agaisnt.<br>
<br>
If the people are really all about saving this game's ass stop dicking around and move things around.<br>
<br>
AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, if you guys wants a lostvillage revision, just do it, will you seriously wait until it's creator to comeback from his years of AFKness?<br>
<br>
1) you're all illegally download files etc this isnt different<br>
2) no one will get sued<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway i'm done, i won't play CAL this season, don't ask me to join a team.<br>
<br>
But hey good day and i love you and all  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">Well this topic has needed to be addressed for quite some time, and since warzone league is the only alternative to cal for americans why not give it another chance.  I have suggested to dallas, the idea of mixed teams since our 1st season was mostly ringers for each team anyways.  He wasn't crazy about the idea, but the good thing about it is it's open to suggestions and if theres a majority rule there will be a change.  Unlike CAL which goes by the book, I have also suggested 4v4 be changed to 3v3 awhile back which was another reason the warzone was created.  It's good to vent once and awhile, especially from the amount of stress this game has caused some people.  I don't know how much longer this game is going to last, but we might as well make the best of this while it's still around.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"></div>

Maybe that is the way to go. Set up pricetags for players based on skill and then do a draft for the season. Teams are only able to pick 4 plus 2 subs and they can not go over the salary cap. Once all the teams have been made, free agents can be picked up. Sounds like a fun league if you ask me. Oh and if there is a conflict of interest on the team, trades can be made, but only before the trade deadline  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> Once teams are established, each team will choose a map of their liking.

Something like that, but it works in a server running sv_cheats 0.  I've seen this twice now.  Once in a pub, now in a Warzone match.  PB has demos of him somewhere.  EC booted him today, and I think he's been kicked from Warzone now too.  I have no idea why he thought he could get away with something as obvious as that.<br>
<br>
So if he pops up in your server and won't die, it's not skill, it's voodoo magic.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Later, TRompe fires an orb that passes Epiphany as he is carrying a barrel. It bounces off the wall behind him, comes directly at him and bounces right off. Doesn't even set off the barrel.<br>
<br>
In EWR's match, an orb bounced off his head and killed his buddy, and then he catches it.<br>

1:18 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: w.e<br>
1:18 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: especially when his score doesnt count and we played the required rounds in which we won<br>
1:18 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: implaia said u werent playing anyway<br>
1:18 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: impailia<br>

1:18 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: thats fine<br>
1:18 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: snail gave up when he couldnt kill the guy no matter what he did<br>
1:18 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: so he started stunsticking only<br>
1:19 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: but that was when the guy was 40 and 0<br>
1:19 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: ok<br>
1:19 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: w.e<br>

1:20 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: ok thats fine<br>
1:21 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: and then add to the fact that you wouldnt play in our server<br>
1:21 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: it was laggy as shit<br>
1:21 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: to many issues for the entire match<br>
1:21 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: our server doesnt lag lol<br>
1:21 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: for us it did<br>
1:21 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: not our problem though because your server lagged for us<br>
1:21 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: we are eastern based<br>
1:22 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: 1 round in yours, 1 in ours<br>
1:22 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: ya<br>
1:22 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: we were doing that<br>
1:22 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: till urs crashed<br>
1:22 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: you wouldnt do it<br>
1:22 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: no<br>

1:22 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: it crashed<br>
1:22 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: no our fault<br>
1:22 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: it crashed when i dropped mani<br>
1:22 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: mani being unloaded isnt a requirement in warzone<br>
1:22 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: so round 3 could of been there<br>
1:23 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: so we played in your server anyways and then when they came to the conclusion that ep couldnt be killed no matter what hit him, they started goofing off. So, that is that<br>
1:23 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: well<br>
1:23 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: we played a 2v2 with da11as and he died a hell of a lot<br>
1:23 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: so<br>
1:24 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: its not that he cant die<br>
1:24 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: he couldnt that round<br>
1:24 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: he did the other 2<br>
1:24 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: you can turn hacks on and off you know<br>
1:24 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: lol<br>
1:24 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: he tried that 1 round only<br>
1:24 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: or if they werent hacks, your server was really fucked up<br>
1:24 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: um<br>

1:25 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: excuses for everything<br>
1:25 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: maybe he was letting his friend borrow his account that round?<br>
1:25 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: um maybe u should just get better guuys?<br>
1:25 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: then u could kill him<br>
1:25 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: lol right<br>
1:26 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: ive never played a player in a match 2 v 2 or above where snail or myself never killed the guy, no matter how good they are. Then add to the fact that the dude has a shitty ping because he is euro, that makes him twice as likely to die more<br>
1:27 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: ive been playing this game for 4 years and ive never seen a round like that<br>

1:32 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: let me check it out<br>

1:51 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: ill watch the vid over<br>
1:51 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: i have to wait another 5 min now<br>

1:53 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: then you can use the slider bar to slow the game way down and view it<br>
1:54 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: alright, u are correct, it does hit him, but that glitches sometimes<br>
1:54 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: it literally bounces off his head<br>

1:55 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: 2 deaths<br>
1:55 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: those 2 deaths were suicides, not really kills<br>
1:55 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: my team didnt kill him once<br>
1:55 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: but it prooves he can die<br>
1:55 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: no it proves he killed himself<br>
1:56 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: and his score proved my team couldnt kill him because he couldnt die<br>
1:56 AM - ?•?|ßlac? ?l???: he could die<br>
1:56 AM - |?lite|??ç?iƒis?: well he didnt and a combine ball couldnt do it<br>

Well, it definitely wasn't sv_cheats 1 being on, I checked for that 1st.  I think the server had mani on it, which does have a command for jacking health up to 50000 iirc, but the console would display that happening unless there's a way to disable it from being displayed in the chat box, and the Warzone config pauses plugins just like the CAL config.  <br>
I used to believe there were no such things as "health hax", but some of the CS:S hax I've seen in the past few months have some type of sv_cheats bypass, that allows players to use cheat protected commands, such as buddha, even though the server was set to sv_cheats 0.  I've only seen it in action once before and the guy was kicked from the server before I got a chance to get a demo.<br>
You can see that a search for CSS hacks will get you stuff like this:

so i congratulated him on the "GODLIKE" announcement (sigh)<br>
and he said "thankyou" i said haha i was being cynical asshole.<br>

peeps need to remember how it was when they started nah scratch that you'll just say <br>
"it made me better"......well to sum that up you may have/prolly been very competitive <br>
all your life at everything you did but..........some people are just learning to be competitive <br>
and have some fun simultaneously and i dont hear of the 99% of reg players telling nubs<br>
"hey NICESHOT" or "GOOD1"(even if it's not so nice of a shot) anymore and that sucks cause it gives them no reason to "want to be leet or just skilled" but i promise you this, every single game i play with and see new players/nubs and they want help i give it and respect with it i mean hey we were all nubs once.<br>

How many does wrw have? A lot more than 5; I'll tell you that. It just boggles my mind that there is such a double standard when it comes to criticism of teams on here. I don't get it; are people afraid of Grain's uncontrollable hormones getting expelled in the form of bad words on the internet?

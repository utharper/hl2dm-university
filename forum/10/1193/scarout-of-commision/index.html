	<div class="content">I'm going to be out for a while. This past week I've been having bad stomach pains during exams at schools. When the tests ended on Friday I went to the Doctors and they sent me get some blood work and cat scan done to be sure. I went to the hospital around 8:30 and got the blood work done, everything came back normal but when the cat scan results came back around 2:30am...they walked in the room asking "what surgeon you want?" They told me I had appendicitis. Around 7:00am on Saturday morning they preped me for surgery and when I got to the Operating Room tey gave me a shot and that the last thing I remember. I woke up in the Recovery room with a shit load of pain and 9 staples in my side. Good thing thought is they gave me pain medicines all through out the day Saturday that were so strong after you took it you feel asleep. But on Sunday they let me start eating again (I havent had food since Friday afternoon) and it sucks because my stomach is killing me from not being used to food or the wound. Later on Sunday they decided I was ready to go home. I was supposed to be released on Monday but I showed a lot of improvement that they thought it wasnt necessary to keep me one more night. <br>
It sucks though, I can't get up on my own, can't sit down on my own. Basically i cant do anything once I lay down I cant do anything. The staples come out in a week and I cant lift anything over 5 pounds of it might strain. This blows it was the last thing I expected and now all I can do is lay down on the couch. Well i just posted this one here so people will know whats up and what happened (since vdus site has bee down for alomst 6 months). I wont be one for a while until this is all healed. I'm on a laptop for the mean time since I got nothing else to do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 I guess the name Scar takes on new meaning now! <br>
I believe they had to cut thru some muscles to get to it, so thats part of the reason you cant sit up or stand on your own. I know someone who had this also recently, it took him about 6 weeks to feel like he could move properly again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I know quite a few people who suffered through excrutiating pain due to blockage in the gull bladder.  They've had it removed and are just fine.  Like I said, it's worthless and will make many people suffer until it's removed.  Also, the pancreas produces digestive "juices" along with a few other things so you're well taken care of.  We sound like a bunch of doctors here, LOL!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

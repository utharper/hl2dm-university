Well you could learn to play quake and call yourself Fatal1ty Theorist man, im sure the community would think it's very cool and wise etc..<br>
<br>
When i asked you why you did this you replied "well your name origin is just a band name" well sorry son but it's more than this. It's not like i don't care about your reasons or w/e but with [VDuS] Con it was confusing enough, what truly amazes me is you realise everyone around you points out how much of a bad idea it is to take this name and yet you keep going.<br>
<br>
What makes it even moooore confusing is that new players or hl2dmu visitors can now talk about/refer to TWO instructors called conflict wich is totally retarded. <br>
<br>
Honestly I wouldn't give a shit if I wasn't invovled in the community because i'd see my online identity as something personal no matter what. I do use alot of names  INGAME but people in these forums and people who watched my vids or downloaded mods on FPSBANANA back in the days remember me as conflict, a name that I use in CAL and everywhere else.<br>
In other game forums as well. <br>
<br>
Don't PM me with stuff like "man people are dumb they think im you" Well of course they do, it's my fucking name you're wearing.<br>
<br>
If you aren't stubborn you will understand reason and take it off for good.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day though.<br>

I KNOW why you like the name CONFLICT THEORIST and is pretty cool <em class="text-italics">HOWEVER</em> I have to agree with .conflict a little, would be best to stay to an original name one  that has no claim or has no one memorable to claim it. <br>
<br>
Personally I always like the name CyberClash.. then I like The Clash and maybe why, it was truly original.  I tried changing my name, it never sticks, I always go back to psychopomp which is the first name I ever used and was designed to be non-gender descriptive, most people do not know what it means.<br>
<br>
I think we can come to a easy resolve if we find a different word for conflict perhaps and be that theory...<br>

<br>
CT was just a sociological perspective that I took from being in class and hearing it that much. As I looked more into the Conflict Theorist's perspective I started to realize that's the path I have been choosing. That's all. And with CyberClash that started back in my original clan and since I was moving into CAL and more I'd like to say "advanced" transition I wanted something new...Ah hell I'll probably just go back to CC.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

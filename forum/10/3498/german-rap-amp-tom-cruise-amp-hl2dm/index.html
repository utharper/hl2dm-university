I wouldn't be so sure about that.<br>
The fact that the guy isn't good at movie making isn't at all related with his skill level. Last time I played him he wasn't bad at all, (even though I had 300 ping ..). At least he seemed to know very well the lost village spawn points and played pretty well that map on 1v1...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I beat him on the eWR or $W server when we had the same ping of 200 and I won by a lot, then he said after the match "vs me in my server and I'll own you lolol", yeah because that would've been a lot more fair if he had 20 ping and I had 400. He sucks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lmao, noticed hahahh.<br>

@Deathwish:<br>
That's a good point..... Yeah I lost against him @ 300 ping, but won on low ping. I really didn't wanna play cuz it's plain dumb to 1v1 in such high ping differences, but he insisted...<br>
Anyway, even if you managed to beat him badly, I wouldn't advice you to go around saying that, it doesn't leave you in a very respectable position  =$</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

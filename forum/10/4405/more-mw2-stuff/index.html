I just came across this today and it floored me......what they have done is made our pc version into a console version run like xbox and ps3.  Now we can NOT have our own servers..<br>
<br>
Saturday, 17 October 2009  <br>
Black Saturday? <br>
<br>
A day of infamy? <br>
<br>
It's hard, very hard, for me to write objectively right now, but here is a summary of what we heard on BASH 123. If you missed it...we will have it on demand in a few minutes. <br>
<br>
The raw version of BASH 123 can be found here temporarily. <br>
<br>
Fourzerotwo was on our BASH webcast this morning and he had a few surprises for the PC community. <br>
<br>
Here are the snippets: <br>
<br>
We're doing a lot on the backend to make the game accessible for everyone. <br>
There is no delay for the PC version of MW2 <br>
There's prestige mode <br>
Jason West at the MP event, said that he was dead on, on the matchmaking servers. We've been building a system on the backend called IW.NET. <br>
You are completely reliant on IW.NET. There are no server lists. There are no dedicated servers. <br>
You have private matches where you can customize the game <br>
You cannot put MW2 on a dedicated server. <br>
This is the first time we've ever done something like this and the team has huge plans for what IW.NET develops into. <br>
Customizing your game...you have quite a few options in a private match <br>
You're getting same game (as in Console), plus matchmaking and private match. <br>
Server admin point-of view, NO DEDICATED SERVERS <br>
I've summarized some of my own thoughts from the cast here: <br>
<br>
General <br>
<br>
IW partnering through Steam is what you will see in the future. Matchmaking is not through Steam, but IW.NET is run in conjunction with Steam.<br>
GSP's will no longer be renting out servers.<br>
No PunkBuster. VAC will be used as an anti cheat.<br>
Retail distribution: Pre-orders will get a disk. Or you could order from Steam.<br>
DLC may now need to be paid for - not confirmed.<br>
Piracy was only a small reason for going to IW.NET - not the whole reason.<br>
Clans: <br>
<br>
No more clan servers. Private matches, replace clan servers. <br>
Listen servers will connect to each other.<br>
IW.NET/Steam will replace the community server admin  <br>
Competitive Gaming <br>
<br>
Competitive gaming has changed forever.<br>
It might be possible in the future for IW engineers to load a "competitive" setting on IW.NET, but it is far from a guarantee. It might also never happen. <br>
Modding <br>
<br>
Modding the game is now very much in question. Fourzerotwo had no info on modding. However, it appears that there will be no mods or maps for MW2. <br>
Modding in SpecOps? Unknown.<br>
<br>
Today our game has changed for ever. <br>
<br>
I'll leave this post with Josh Peckler's comments from planetmedalofhonor.com: <br>
<br>
The server community is what's made us. It's what defined us.<br>
<br>
IW.NET is getting the PC community to turn into consoles. You're trying to re-write our history.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yep, better get used to it here is another post from someone I know in a MW clan.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The Future of online gaming is..... what you see in MW2.<br>
<br>
I just spent a couple of hours talking to two lead programmer/developers I've known for a long time.  One from Valve, one from a new "offshoot" company who's name would be instantly recognizable to almost any oldskool gamer.<br>
<br>
What you see in MW2 is what you will see from everyone in the next year or two as far as delivery and servers go.  A game in particular we discussed is being developed for Korea, where this style of software delivery is the  norm.  In fact, the Asian market is driving this change from the  NA/Euro style we are accustomed to, to their  "similar to shareware" thing.  <br>
<br>
Basicly, the Korean base game is FREE or almost free.  It lacks features for MP, which you must  EARN from playing or pay extra for.  They control the dedicated servers, which are a fallback, in the event you cannot host your own game.  They simply lease the server space from the companies that we rent from now.  Content updates are very frequent, instead of  getting all the cool features at once, it is dolled out to you little at a time to keep you playing and coming back for more.  Companies will no longer spend 2 years making a single game for $50, instead keep adding and adding $1 &amp; $5 bits and pieces to a base game.  All with STEAM style content delivery.<br>
<br>
Major Developers right now are working towards this goal in NA &amp; Europe.  This of course includes the very companies that pretty much started the whole SDK thing.  <br>
<br>
L4D &amp; L4D2 has both worlds incorporated for the most part (for now).  The technology has been proven.    MW2 has taken the next step, and soon... so will every new major MP release.  They (other developers) arent just contemplating it..  they are DOING it.  A point was made to me as follows:   "the flame/complaints you see directed at IW now, represent  less than 1% of the market for their development time.  The NA/Euro hosting / purchasing style has run its course."<br>
<br>
My friend was writing add'l code for  "Matchmaking" for a new release FPS in Korea.  I have seen parts/details of the game, which runs on the SOURCE engine.  Once it is released in Korea, they turn to the NA portion of the release.  I promised I wouldnt post names or details.<br>
<br>
No shit.   and I seriously hate change.  I know some of this is on other threads, just thought I would mention it.<br>

1.pc gamers are hardcore and hate changes <br>
2.MW is a competitive fps its not L4D where no one gives a damn about teams or right server environment for them since it purely based around your current core of friends. MW needs a place for peeps to meet up by providing random locations (servers that only developers control) no strong community can be formed. basicly they removing all that good about PC gaming<br>
3.Its works on a console because no one cares. Those that play on a console see it as it is a game and most like me hardly use multiplayer on the console or even care. I mostly just look for casual single player games for the console.<br>
<br>
I just feel this could be a great game for the PC but what they doing is removing one of the core reasons for PC gaming they might as well not bother making a PC version of the game and just give us all the middle finger and tell us to play it on a console.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

For games that are offered on both PC and xbox, the sales for Xbox and PS3 greatly overshadow PC sales.     People dont want to have to buy a $1000+ machine to play games only to have to pay $300-$400 to upgrade shit every 2 years when they can spend that much every 3-4 years and have a console.  I go to vid game shows and all they talk about is games on Xbox and PS3, they hardly ever mention PC, ever.

	<div class="content">The biggest problem with PC gaming is lack of unity or organization each game is by itself the people who make PCs have no reward for selling PCs that can game and they have no reason to push a particular game or advertise it. Consoles on the other hand have a shared interest among developers and the console maker. Both make money if a game is sold and so both work together to advertise both the game and the system at the same time so they can do super bowl ads. It is very very sad but if you are like me and you never play for anything but fun you really do not care, I would be perfectly happy to play a game with only 10 people so long as the game was fun and those 10 people would play at the same time as me. There will always be a place for PC gaming as long as people have PCs. Another optimistic way to look at things is that the overall size of DM gaming probably has not shrunk since the glory days of quake what actually happened is that the total number of players grew at an insane rate and so there were just that many more people playing CS. Also there was fragmentation as gamers played new DM games if you think about it there are probably 10 - 20 games out there that play pretty much exactly like quake and it would be better for all of them if they would all close down their doors and just move to whatever the latest quake is. <br>
<br>
On a side note I think my favorite time in the history of gaming was around the 2000 era that was when we were morphing from quake to games like UT HLDM, Tribes. This was a great time when games were actually becoming better as in they had more diversity and features. Now days we are just going backwards as more skilled games are replaced by less skilled ones like MW2, CSS, BF(whatever one). Hopefully one day the millions of gamers will start to seek something more out of a game and there will be a new phenomenon game. One day again I would like to assemble enough people mostly modelers to make a new game one that has more to it rather then the pattern of having less.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Fearsome, the exact problem is when the games are geared toward consoles, you lose the depth you are saying you want in a game.  There is no way to put the variety of commands and options into a fucking controller with 8 buttons and 2 joysticks compaired to a keyboard with 40+ keys.  The other problem is that the average PC may be able to play some games when new, but very quickly gets outpaced by new games and the hardware cant keep up unless you upgrade or buy a new one.  Most people dont want to do that.  Consoles are a much cheaper option to a "gaming PC".<br>

Yeah but I can't take the keyboard right here in front of me as I'm typing this message and plug it in, nor can i do the same with my mouse.  I also dont think Microsoft officially supports the use of the keyboard/mouse made for 360, so fuck that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yes to the masses it is true in the short run a console is cheaper maybe, after all you can put together a gaming PC for 500$ but if you buy a couple games and think about the fact you still need a computer on top of the console it is way more expensive the games are more expensive and the peripherals are more expensive and do less. The only other thing is that console gamers seem to think it is ok to play on 5 year old hardware and think that it is still good. IMO console gamers are just more accepting of junk. Unfortunately with out the mass organization of the PC gaming companies no one will ever know this. The most powerful gaming console is the PS3 and it is running a 7800GTX video card and there are still clowns out there claiming it is a home super computer and just better then any PC when the reality is the hardware was surpassed by modest PCs years ago. Most computers really need nothing other then a 600 series video card to play every game out there this is the tragedy of PC gaming and something epic founder often comments on, if you could just get more x6x series video cards out there gaming would blow up. take that as a lesson if any of you are helping anyone make a computer purchase, I never let anyone get away with less then a ati 4650+ or 9600/260+ gpu it really costs them almost nothing and they are much happier with the computer for its entire life span.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Dirt off their shoulder. Cut that petition number in half or a little less then, because I'm more then willing to bet a 1/4, 2/4 of the signers will cave in and buy it anyway in the future. The lost profits will be made up in the tight new grip they'll have in controlling piracy, releasing mods, updates ect ect ect at a cost to the owners and will make it up overtime. Losing 80-100k buyers will make them flinch but this thing will be selling in the 10's of millions real quick and they know overtime if they stick with their guns their way of doing things will eventually become the norm. And yeah the game will get pirated anyway but it will far less potent then on the old platform of doing things. Only way I actually see the petition having effect is if it reaches the half million mark then top to bottom at IW will be in panic mode.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't see it becoming the new norm at all in fact it would just be the end and I really don't see how it will stop or even slow down piracy either. <br>
The 80k sigs probably only represents a small portion of people that know about it, so many  more are going to be finding out soon and for some it will be after they bought the game, guaranteed most of those pc gamers who find out to late will never buy IW again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i played hockey for 25 years.  gave a lot of these and took some too.  let me just tell you, a common misconception of hockey "fans" is the board checks hurt, they dont, these do.  mostly afterwards.  oh and what ever the idiots are commenting when you watch this........this was a 100% clean hit.  no charge, no elbow, all shoulder.  some said that he didnt have posession of the puck, well he did, if the puck is in your skates then you are in posession of it.  why he looked at Kronwall and then decided to look down at the puck i will never know.  thats one of the biggest rules in hockey, if the puck is in your skates never look down at it.  unlike the cambell hit on umburger a couple years ago, havlat has nobody to blame but himself here, he wasnt given a hospital aka buddy pass at all.<br>

This was the exact same situation. I know I seem like a broken record posting this image, but this one applies perfectly. The defenseman passes the puck from behind the net to the wing. I stepped him when the puck was about to hit his stick and hit him. Those type of hits are mainly the defensemen's fault for not noticing the opponent stepping up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

oooof, you failed that test man.  you would have been toast just like him.  he had no where near enough time to do that.  his best bet there was to let the puck go and drop his shoulder into Kronwall.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

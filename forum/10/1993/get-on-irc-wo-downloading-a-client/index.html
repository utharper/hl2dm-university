	<div class="content">You never need to register with gamesurge or any other IRC server to join IRC and talk unless you plan to enter channels where only voiced persons can talk. HL2DM is not such a channel. If registration is what is stopping you from joining IRC just forget it and join up. Later on you can learn to do that if you need to. <br>
<br>
You would need to register if you want to have IRC assign you any power in a channel such as my clan all want to register to that they can be admins in our clan channel and kick people out or change the channel title or whatever. Also it is good to register so people can be sure that they are talking to you and not someone claming to be you. Since registration makes you enter a password and assigns you what is basically a user name. <br>
<br>
Also if you join IRC through the web based java interface you should also type /nick YOURNAME so you do not sit with the default name. <br>
<br>
We want to put a java based IRC client on the HL2DM U site as well. Just have to get access for the guy who can do it. This one would automatically connect you to the right server and maybe if we were slick it would use your forum name as your nick name in IRC.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

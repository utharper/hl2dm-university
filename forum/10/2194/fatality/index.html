	<div class="content">You all prolly heard about this but if not:<br>
<br>
Wednesday night, a 40-year old man aboard a Canadian Greyhound bus traveling from Edmonton, Alberta, to Winnipeg stabbed and then decapitated a fellow passenger, USA Today reports. He was arrested at the end of the whole thing, in case you were wondering.<br>
<br>
This story has gotten extensive coverage all over the world. People have been quoted as saying they'll never take the bus ever again, until safety regulations on buses are in place. I don't know. Can you really draw conclusions from one weird case?<br>
<br>
In case you haven't heard exactly what happened, here is a glimpse, according to fellow passengers interviewed by Associated Press:<br>
<br>
The victim, who appeared to be about 19, was sleeping with headphones on when his seat mate suddenly began stabbing him as the bus traveled a desolate stretch of the TransCanada Highway, a dozen miles from Portage La Prairie. He stabbed him about 40-50 times.<br>
<br>
The bus stopped and the passengers tried to get away while the attacker allegedly began calmly and methodically carving up the man's body. Unbelievable.<br>
<br>
Passengers disembarked and braced themselves against the door to prevent the attacker from leaving while they waited for police to arrive. The attacker went back and brought the head to the front and dropped it on the ground in front of the passengers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

To put it bluntly: Most people arent willing to potentially sacrifice themselves for a random.<br>
<br>
That or their desire to help the victim was exceeded by their fear of joining him.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I totally agree, but on the other hand, personally i'd try to stop a robbery or a fist fight, because these people can be threatened or reasoned with. A maniac randomly decapitating a sleeping passenger with a machete probably doesn't give a shit about pain, cops, death, killing more peeps.<br>
<br>
I remember when my parents used to own a retirement house for old farts. there was this women, she required assistance to walk, take a bath eat... and one of these day, she looked really odd and after trying to make her eat several time she stood up and punched the nurse, we called an ambulance it required 3 men to get her in the ambulance and the week before she couldnt kill a fly. Adrenaline and madness is indeed a very bad mix. I kinda understand why these people didn't act. <br>
<br>
But still, looking at it in a logic way... bad call peeps. <br>

<br>
That was exactly the first thing I thought of as well. Sure, no one wants to be stabbed, but a <em class="text-italics">group</em> of several people can easily take down a guy weilding a knife. I was at a, um, gogo bar  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  several years ago when a guy had a seizure induced by the strobe lights flickering from the stage. I'd say there were approximately 30 people in the place, and not ONE person other than myself stepped forward to help. It just seems most people get that scared lemmings effect when confronted with things they do not understand. Just read a story about a famous football player coming to a choking victims' aid as the rest of the place stood by idly and watched this poor guy nearly choke to death.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Except that in a bus, with its narrow aisle creating an effective 1-person wide choke point, itd actually end up as 1v1, not 30v1. And how many of those people, especially the 50% or so who were kids/old/fat/sedentary, are going to want to be the first to 1v1 a knife-crazy with their bare hands?<br>
<br>
Also, sleeping in a public place with strangers all about is the epitome of stupid, though it certainly sucks for the victim that he didnt live to learn his lesson.<br>
<br>
Its also ridiculous that 99% of the population wanders around unarmed and defenseless most of the time, but thats a topic unto itself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yet they let a muscle-monster-wrestling-kungfu-steven-seagal guy go on a plane without asking question. seriously armed or not you're never really safe no matter what so i doubt it's the key.

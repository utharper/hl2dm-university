	<div class="content">i made a league for fantasy NHL hockey.  it costs $18 to play.  anybody interested in playing in my league please post your email or give it to me thru steam and i will send you the invite.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
here are the basic rules:<br>
<br>
In Ultimate Salary Cap Hockey, you're the General Manager of your very own hockey team! We give you 50,000,000 Sporting News Dollars (TSND) to draft 12 players (3 centers, 4 wingers, 3 defensemen and 2 goalies) who will score points for you based on how they play in real-life hockey games. <br>
<br>
As GM, you use your 50,000,000 TSND salary cap to build the best hockey team you can afford. While they're on your team, your players score Sporting News Points (TSNP) towards your season-long total by playing in real-life games. If one of your players is in a bad slump, or if he gets hurt, you can cut him and pick up another player to join your team, provided you can afford him. Manage your team wisely, though - you have a limited amount of moves you can make. <br>
<br>
Ultimate Salary Cap Hockey also features a dynamic player price market - the only one of its kind. Every scheduled gameday during the season (except for the All-Star Break), players salaries are updated, rising or falling based on the trading activity by YOU, the GMs. Just like the stock market, you can increase your purchasing power by buying low and selling high<br>
<br>
What's the basic strategy? <br>
<br>
There's no one tip we can give you to guarantee victory. Winning at Ultimate Salary Cap Hockey takes intuition, luck, research, and trial and error. Here are some basic principles to get you started. <br>
<br>
Spot the bargains. If you pick a player that performs better than his salary would otherwise dictate, you improve your team's score as well as save money to spend on the rest of your team.<br>
<br>
Play the Market. Buy low, sell high. By buying players in high demand and then selling them to reap the gains, you can increase your total team value and buy better, higher-priced players.<br>
<br>
Know who they're playing. Some teams have goalies who couldn't stop a beach ball. Pay attention to skaters who are going against these weak goalies and make sure they're skating on your side. <br>
Know who they're playing with. There is probably no better job than skating on Peter Forsberg's wing, you're bound to pick up a few extra points. <br>
How do trades work? <br>
After the first Roster Freeze of the season (Saturday, October 4th at 11pm ET), each time you sell a player from your roster, one trade is deducted. Buying a player to fill an open spot does not count as a trade.<br>
<br>
  <br>
How does the scoring system work? <br>
<br>
The object of the game is to score the most Sporting News Points (TSNP) over the course of the season. <br>

<br>
Anyways, I don't like the scoring system. 20 points for a shorthanded goal and game winning goal are bs. They should be more than a regular goal. Unless, you get 25 for a goal then 20 more for a shorthanded goal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

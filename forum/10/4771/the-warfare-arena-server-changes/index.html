	<div class="content">Hey guys, The server now just has Keeper sounds plugin and is vanilla otherwise. If anyone has any changes they think should be made let me know. Maps added,time limits,frag limits etc. It's set for 50 frags or 15 minutes now. It runs alot smoother now with no one crashing so far...<img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">  enjoy!<br>
<br>
A special thanks to Luke for helping me out! You da man!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">...from your previous thread:
<blockquote><div><cite>Mr. NewGuy wrote:</cite>dm_airfusion (soon to be dm_airfusion_final)<br>
dm_caverns_r1<br>
dm_helix (I know how to revise this :: 'casue-am newguy)<br>
dm_is_alive<br>
dm_lockdown_r5 (still a prop-noob map where someone who fails at life [like tlc] can get top kill- but lets not judge)<br>
dm_lostarena<br>
dm_lostvillage_v3 (the best version - it just is.)<br>
dm_milieu_final<br>
dm_octagon<br>
dm_rapidfire_r2 (soon to be dm_rapidfire_final)<br>
dm_warlock_final (meh)<br>
dm_winterchill_r3 <br>
<br>
I also vote for no-mani, just 'keeper's sound plug-in' if there is to be any at all. <br>
This is similar to the mapcycle I ran at TPS. <br>
However, I also had dm_overwatch and dm_pueblo in there becasue the former was used to bring in 'SoCal' noob-traffic (no, not u blast <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">) and the latter was 'new &amp; exciting' at the time. <br>
I quickly found out that people didn't like pueblo too much for a pub-map and neither did I. <br>
<br>
If there is no plug-ins for a vote, try to run a mapcycle like this. <br>
If there is a vote, this is a good pool to vote from, but be sure to not allow people to vote for the same map they are currently playing. <br>
Voting to extend a map can also be annoying when it is allowed more that once; milieu looks great and all, but playing it for an hour gets mighty tiresome. <br>
In the case of no-vote, have the rounds set at 25 min as well as leave the cycle in alphabetical order so anyone can know what map(s) to expect next. <br>
25 min round time is ideal becasue it is long enough to enjoy a map properly; but if someone does not like a particular map, they don't have to wait too long for it to pass.</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Maybe something like 20 minutes with a 100 frag limit. <br>
That way only actually good people can end a map early.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

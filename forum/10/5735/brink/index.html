Now onto the part that you want to read, the dedicated servers. It’s been said that the game will use the dedicated system, but it will be a Standalone application.<br>
<br>
MhmMmm, you heard me right, player hosted, free to set up, no need to have the game, fully administratrable dedicated server app. You will also be able to host multiple servers on one machine with different “pre-made bat files that automatically define different ports for each instance”. It will be fully customizable, with commands that will allow you to modify “team sizes, time limits and overtime, warm-up rules, friendly fire, voice chat, availability of Command Post buffs, rank restrictions, number of bots, and the password”. <br>
<br>
Another cool thing is that this software will be available before the game comes out, this means that servers will be up in the first second of the game’s release, and boy will they be crowded.<br>

-hip firing is very effective ( very little spread and no recoil)<br>
<br>
Comp. features<br>
-the dev's said brink's customizable like their previous games (etqw, w:et)<br>
-can increase fov (prolly up to 110)<br>

I'd have to agree with Constipator on this one. It looks like Battlefield type shooting (aka "realistic" not "arcadey") mixed with TF2 style gameplay. Team-based online games are fun when you have a good team, but when you need specific people to be doing specific things in order to succeed, I can see Brink becoming very frustrating (like pubbing in TF2). I also prefer arcade style shooting when it comes to online FPS games because it provides you with greater accuracy and less hip spraying. From what I've seen this game is all about the realistic, slowed down, motion blurred mouse movements with hip firing being encouraged. The only thing that appeals to me about this game is the customization and the fact that so many of you are going to get it. I'll wait and hear some honest feedback before buying this one.</div></blockquote>

i actually think this is where brink will succeed.  there are a lot of objectives to be done but the game not only makes it easy for players to find them, but lets other players know what that person is doing.  its made to not only give xp for kills, but for helping the team.  even if you're playing a pub style match where nobody is talking, you can still see what needs to be done, how to do it, and where.  instead of 8 ppl running around not doing anything and/or doing things that others are already doing, you have a match where even random players know what is going on.  if you join up and find yourself using a class that too many others are using, you can switch on the fly, without having to spawn and quickly move to objectives that arent being worked on.   for those fixed on xp and leader board standings you dont have to ignore the objectives just to get kills.  you get a lot of xp for doing your job, and get more xp for kills in your job range.  that and the dramatic art style, customizable everything, and a smooth movement style, i think this is gonna be a winner.  thats what i see in it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">exactly. im actually assuming ppl are dumb.  finally a game that has objectives AND takes into account that most matches you will be part of WONT be with a team of friends that know what they are doing.  by that i mean, not just know how to play the game and point a cross hair at enemies, but know how to work together to accomplish the bigger goal of winning the match by completing the objectives given.  the game has a narator that dynamically gives objective commands to your specific class.  plus you have a HUD that lets you know what needs to be done.  its a brilliant system imo.  im sure you will have the haters saying that this is too "hold your hand"  but its better than the TF2 pub style you mentioned Grain.   im sure there will be a pro mod that turns off the narator too.  <br>
<br>
what really excites me about this game is the developer didnt just say, "hey thats a great system, publish it"  the afformentioned is just part of what they did. <br>
<br>
-they spent 4 days in the dessert recording gun sounds to make sure everything sounded perfect.  <br>
-they took a dramatic approach to character design, over emphasising facial feature so that your specific character that you customized is easily reconized by team mates.  <br>
-they put in more customization then i have ever seen in a game before(atleast a FPS)<br>
-they build this SMART system which lets you move smoothly over obsticles, not just jump and crouch, but jump, put your hand out and bring up your knee.  the way you would do it in RL.    grabbing ledges and pulling yourself up.  EVRYTHING is climbable.  there isnt some random rock or box that you cant get over.   <br>
-plus the art design is awesome<br>
<br>
<br>
what also excites me is this game was supposed to come out a LONG time ago.  they delayed it, went back to the drawing board and made it better(shows they actually give a fuck about the game, not just making money)<br>
<br>
on top of all that, the admitted that production finished up earlier than expected so they released it a week earlier.  i cant remember the last time i saw that happen. that show me they actually care about their customers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So I played for about 4 hours last night and I tought I'd share my experience so far.<br>
<br>
The SinglePlayer experience is nowhere near COD/BF series. I never cared about the ark or my faction at any point. The A.I on both (your and ennemy) teams is kind of poor.<br>
Multiplayer wise, If you liked Ennemy Terriroty/Killzone you will love this. The whole melee system reminds me of my beloved F.E.A.R game back in the days.<br>
<br>
The guns are fun to use, they sound great and feel really different from each others.<br>
<br>
All in all it's not AS GOOD as I wish it would've been, but it's fun nonetheless, there are some competitions out there with prizes, for those who already got the game I suggest we group up under one clan (maybe #hl2dm or something) and annihilate those HALO noobs.<br>
<br>
anyhow, here's a review:<br>

	<div class="content">I've got mixed feelings on the game so far and I can't even necessarily pin it down where it's lacking for me, but it is.  I've only played for an hour and a half and need more time to get a better feeling of the game.  The S.M.A.R.T. system is interesting.  The game tells you to move more than shoot, yet it seems like a pain to move sometimes.<br>
<br>
I love the weapon sounds, the amount of weapons there are, the amount of modifications you can do to those weapons and your character.  I want to play some real, competitive games though.  I want to push this game and see how far it can be pushed and if it's worth getting into.<br>
<br>
I wish there was a DM style mode where everyone could just run around the Ark and light each other up.  But so far all I've seen is team-based games.  Oh well, I can dream can't I?<br>

I changed my name to "#hl2dm Isaac" and I want to own some console fanboys.<br>

It's both single-player and multi-player, however single-player you'll see it the most as the bots just stand there and let you mow them down.<br>

As far multi-player, this:

	<div class="content">So to sum things up. Up til now i haven't seen any serious gameplay critique from anyone. only (admittedly) critical bugs. This is inexcusable however even Valve released big titles with enormous bugs in them and then delayed fixes for months.<br>
I didn't like the regional release business though. It's probably physically shipping from the US and the 3 days delay comes to give retailers a chance to stock up and compete with elec dist but as the customer i shouldn't be bothered with that. not to mention i pre-ordered and pro-loaded. wtf.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

ok, there are a number of bugs in this game for sure.  they will all be fixed.  couple that i have seen repeatly:<br>
<br>
--the turret.  they dont see ANYTHING.   if my turret actually fires AT ALL, im impressed.  <br>
<br>
--the engineer built MG nest.  the MG does hardly any more damage then a SMG.  i was open firing on a guy, cross hairs spot on, only to have him turn around and one shot kill me with a pistol...<br>
<br>
--the famous blue tint<br>
<br>
--the "buff health drag" is kind of cheap.  i can be a heavy with a chain gun, slow as fuck, but if im a medic and go to buff a light body who's running fast i can get dragged along at his speed.  this will be exploited to hell and back.  gotta remove it.  <br>
<br>
--container city offensive spawn point has to be fixed.  <br>
<br>
as far as the missions go,  i would like to see something a little more creative than excorting a maintainance bot and an injured pilot.  how does a crippled soldier limp across a battlefield while the ppl around him are getting blown away.  fuck, he should be escorting us if he's so bullet proof.  and if he's so bullet proof why is he injured in the first place.   seems like there are a lot of cool side missions to be done but a lot of them seem pointless when the goal is just to walk behind a bot.  <br>
<br>
<br>
overall, in all honesty, i was dissapointed with the game at first.  BUT the more i play and understand the finesse of it the more enjoyable it gets.  this game has a lot of potential.  dont write it off just yet.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I really like this game. It has something that I have been missing for a long time in modern shooters which is 'depth'. At first you feel lost but once you learn the maps and what class and weapons to use you have a blast. The problem I have is the developer implemented no hand holding for new comers. Now that not a problem for me since I can work through it but when I play with these new comers. They simply have not a clue what to do or where to go but then you might ask what about the objective wheel which does help it but it can't cover the stuff needed to help achieve the primary objective. The developer splash damage start as a bunch of modders for the hardcore community so that does explain the hands off approach. It would of been better to use a in game tutorial to start off with for the players than the video clip on basics.<br>
<br>
It does annoy me that people are being put off by bad reviews which this game does not deserve. That mainly because these guys have tried something fresh and are being bashed because it not similar to other fps games. This is not a game that gives instant gratification but rewards you the more time and effort you put into it. Reminds me of what fps games used to be before the cod generation.<br>
<br>
As NG said this games has potential since at the heart of the game the mechanics are fun and especially that SD has built the game up so they can make changes with out any major coding (so except some quick balancing and glitch fixes) and also they seem like the first developer (apart from valve) in a long time to support the PC platform. Plus new DLC of maps and goodies coming up makes me feel confident in this game's future.<br>
<br>
@keefy.  It would help to know but the source of the problem is. Is it graphics or connection. I try and cover both if you got a Ati card (not too sure which models are effected) it might get fixed if you roll back the driver from the latest version or turn off ambient osculation. Connection might be your firewall but as far as I know I have not seen any net cvars in the user cfg so not sure any tweaking down your end will fix the issue. Apart from that searching forums on Steam, Bethesda or Splash damage might help.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">For those of you feeling this game is slow or for anyone that wants it to be faster, try this:  <br>
<br>
Make an autoexec.cfg in wordpad and put the following commands in it<br>
<br>
Seta ui_fov ##  (recommend setting this to 90 or 95 in place of ##)<br>
<br>
For dual, quad and six core processors (pretty much everyone these days)<br>
<br>
Seta r_useThreadedRenderer 2<br>
<br>
Put the autoexec.cfg in the steam/userdata/*yourname*/22350/local/base folder.  This also where your brink mp cfg is, but they tell you not to edit that and to use an autoexec for customization.<br>
<br>
Also use the light body type if you have a decent enough shot to survive with it.  The light body type is not only faster, but has movement capability that is not available to the medium body type.  As with HL2DM, keep moving!  <br>
<br>
The game is alot of fun IMO.  It has alot more depth than anything we have seen in recent years.  Its not run and gun COD.   It requires thinking, teamwork, coordination and skill.  Its not about KDR, or XP.    I've seen teams with guys earning double XP compaired to the other team but losing because they didn't work as a team and do what had to be done.  Its about playing smart and doing what you have to do as a team to complete the objective.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Unfortunately more than half of those are 10 year olds on roleplay/coop servers<br>

Yeah Brink was a bit of a disappointment for many.  Lots of issues with maps being too defensive sided and other things.   It could have been alot better but they probably spent too much of their time on player appearance customizations instead of the more important things to balance gameplay etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The parkour isnt even about usign it to out dodge dodge bullets and enemies aiming etc its about using it to flank enemies and regardless of the smart crap still better off ducking behind an object and popping out for a few shots which to me is boring as fuck I would rather paint the house which I am doing on Saturday.<br>

	<div class="content">I got to say this is a text book example of how not to release a new IP. Like...<br>
<br>
1. Do not misinform on what the game is about e.g don't say it has a in depth single player when it does not<br>
2. Do a open beta and test it too the max. This holds true for any multiplayer based game.<br>
3. Hire testers that know their stuff. Like emm don't hire console testers that simply don't know shit on what makes a good fps<br>
3. Do not release a game until it is ready <br>
4. Don't send buggy demos to reviewers <br>
5. If it is multiplayer heavy do not allow reviewers to review the game until it is out or better yet have a open or closed beta for them.<br>
6. If releasing on the pc platform make sure that your game in supported by both ati and nvida cards.<br>
7. patches should address issues in this order. performance issues, game braking bugs, map balancing, ability tweaks, weapon balancing and so other stuff like stat site, dlc and other stuff that does not effect the game should be done last.<br>
<br>
The game had a lot of potential but sadly mistakes where made which is to be expected out of a first full game released by a developer. Unlike some peeps that like to shit all over people that try and bring something new I actually try and support developer studios by taking my time to understand the game and play it my self before passing judgement. On the whole my initial reaction to the game was positive it gave me the feeling I had not had for a long time and yes I had fun and got more fun playing scrims on esl cup games than pub. But as I said in number seven major map issues on balancing where not addressed and sadly over time I grew tired off waiting for the issues to be resolved. As well they made a lot of people angry over the performance me included I got a quad and gtx560ti and I still can't get it to run smoothly. The game breaker came in the last update on gun balancing which they some how made worse by nerfing the few good guns and making it worse with random recoil which meant that it turned the game into more luck than skill.<br>
<br>
So after all this they have sold a lot of copies so not a financial fail or success really. The game is dead on the pc and I don't think the dlc and major patch will fix it. It was a good distraction for the past fews months for me anyway and came across some new players and teams out of it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

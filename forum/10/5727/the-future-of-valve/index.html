	<div class="content">First of all, Hi again!<br>
<br>
Found this in my internet traevls today.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://kotaku.com/#!5795355/valve-probably-done-with-single+player-games" class="postlink">http://kotaku.com/#!5795355/valve-proba ... ayer-games</a><br>
<br>
While I'm pretty sure the title is something taken out of context it does make me wonder. We'll probably hear of Episode 3 before the year ends. At least I hope. There's been enough hinting at it from valve around the Portal 2 release and within Portal 2 itself from what I hear.<br>
<br>
I guess this article means that if theres a HL3 we'll most likely get another DM game to mess around with.<br>

	<div class="content">Thats odd because I came to a different conclusion regarding modern shooters.<br>
<br>
Whenever playing online you're ridiculed by either:<br>
Using a scope/ironsight<br>
Using 'perks' that give you an advantage<br>
<br>
From what I've seen players are purposely not using features in the game to make the game more of a challenge. I think the fad of 'modern shooters' is coming to an end and we'll be seeing a move towards deathmatch games again.<br>
<br>
At least I feel confident in saying that Valve wont tack on health regeneration in its multiplayer games given the popularity of TF2 and l4d. Both having healthbars. <br>
<br>
iirc DNF has an ego bar rather than a health bar and comes with deathmatch multiplayer as well. Even though its an 8 person max.<br>
<br>
I still think we'll see a hl3dm considering how hl2dm was a tacked on thing. Valve will not change multiplayer modes for a game that has a campaign as a main focus. Be it singleplayer or co op.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The same valve that wouldn't nickel and dime customers or the same valve that said not deviating from TF2's art style is the most important factor to consider?<br>
<br>
Perhaps the valve that said they would work on l4dead and not a sequel or the same valve that shit on their games so a handful of macfags could play without bootcamp?<br>
<br>
Nothing personal, just pointing out the fact that it's EA calling the shots now not valve, and no the "modern gamer" is only getting worse bro. I was informed the other day that killzone 3 is "too fast".<br>
<br>
The "modern gamer" can't get enough of these perks and advantages and the best part, they still use the cheapest noob friendly path they can take in the easiest games ever made, then proceed to brag to their fellow terrible gamers about how good they are. <br>
<br>
Some of them decide to come to PC gaming and quickly receive their ass on a platter, so they exploit and cheat their way through the community and usually talk the most shit doing it.<br>
<br>
They will not stop catering to this crowd because it's highly lucrative, the same people that ripped on gaming are now it's best customers, they have to ensure repeat customers and how do you think they will go about that?<br>
<br>
Battlefield 3 will be good but probably the usual 3 weeks of booming community followed by mass exodus because they have no say in the airstrikes and sprint isn't permanent.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I respect your opinion and in the effort of not getting into an argument I'll just leave it at that. I have an optimistic outlook on where gaming in general may go, however stupid that may sound. Only time will tell where this goes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

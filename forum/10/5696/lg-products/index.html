	<div class="content">It may be your TV that you say is a crt, and replacing that with the LG TV would be fine for television and movies; however if you are planning on using it for your PC/games and are still using that GTX 460, you should note that the maximum refresh rate for a HDMI TV-out on these Fermi-GPU cards is 60Hz. <br>
<br>
It was pretty fucking gay when I found that out trying to get my PC to goto 240Hz on my friends 52" LED TV. The maximum refresh rate listed on the Fermi cards is 240Hz, but that is only from the goddamn Dual-link DVI cable. Does that LG model have a dual-dvi input? <br>
I think I was looking at that TV when it was on sale in October 2010 until I realized it would not fit on my desk. I settled on the over-priced ASUS 120Hz monitor. And yah, 120Hz is rape, but I have only seen PC's being able to achieve it through a DVI cable of some kind. Even when my Asian friend (so he obviously knew his shit on electronics) got a DVI-to-HDMI converter thingy, it still would only display any type of image whilst in "TV mode" under nVidia control panel - which if you look is only @ 60-mother-fucking-Hz. <br>
<br>
TV's are made for console games, and consoles are usually locked @ 24/30fps; as such, the moronic masses that play COD don't know jack shit about proper FPS:Hz and won't demand a DVI link for 100+ hertz. I want to shove them all in an oven. <br>
<br>
Aside form all that, LG electronics have done well by me in my experience with them. Never had to RMA or know what their customer support is like.  <br>
Sorry for not being of more help. <br>
<br>
EDIT: Shit from LG I have used: <br>
some 16:10 monitor (1440x900@60hz and 5ms)<br>
Bunch of phones; all were very durable and did not break, but I lost 2 'casue I am an idiot and the last one was stolen. <br>
Currently using a LG Optimus V and its pretty solid. <br>
<br>
The monitor is from 2005 and still works well as the display for my Server shizzle.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Looking at the picture of the TV it has no DVI but it does have the RGB connector which may allow for more than 60 hz. My sony crt will do 150 hz over that same type of input so I would think it would work here as well. Possibly you could contact LG technical support to find out for sure though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Of course, if you are hooking up cable, it doesn't make a fuck if your PC DVMI/SuperQuad/DRM output is only 60 h.<br>
And again LEDs don't fucking refresh like CRTs.<br>
<br>
But, no DVI means you'd have hookup the PC some other way.<br>

	<div class="content">Contacting their customer support is the best idea, you'll get a feel for what any needed RMA process would be like and they will know if your PC gaming will be @ 120Hz. <br>
<br>
According the the research my oriental Best Buy manager friend has done, TV's, as opposed to monitors, are shit when it comes to actual PC gaming above 60hz. <br>
Something to do with the interface LCD/LED's do with the DVI shit. <br>
In the CRT days, I am told, you had to get the driver info and stuff for your display and install it so the VGA knew what was going-down on the output end. <br>
Zaulphkar (the best buy fag) tells me that the analog interface would not transfer the display's specifications to the VGA, just shit about the raw video data; whereas this LCD of mine was recognized right off the bat by my 470's as an ASUS VG236He and knew all the possible refresh rates ranging from 50hz to 120hz. <br>
Plain, simple, Plug&amp;Play. It's the only way a tech-moron like me can roll. <br>
<br>
So the new video cards, like the Fermi ones, are expecting the display to automatically tell them wtf is going on. <br>
Unless of course, it is in TV mode which pretty much forces the Video Card to behave similar to a blu-ray player, and the VGA just plainly transmits the video-shit and lets the TV figure the rest out. <br>
In my attempt to play Half-Life games @ true 240Hz, since I always get above 300fps, I could only see any kind of image on the TV while in the basic nVidia-TV-mode. <br>
This was true in both a DVI-to-analog and DVI-to-HDMI connections in both the one analog-PC-port of Z's TV and all 5 of his HDMI ones. Ultra redundant, yah, but I really wanted to see hl2dm @ 240hz. Nothing worked, and it was stuck @ 60hz.<br>
Z now tells me it is because of this lack of 'specification-data-thing' that the VGA would say "fuck off" to my idea of PC shit @ 240Hz.<br>
His TV was a Samsung brand, but I doubt LG is that much different.<br>
<br>
I am confident, like Punk, that you can pull-off 120hz in hl2dm on that TV display; you just need to nig-rig it. <br>
I am sure there is some riviaTuner-mod shit that will let you take control of your card and transmit whatever you'd like however you'd like. <br>
Setting a Refresh rate too high will fuck up the display, not the card, so it can't be impossible. <br>
<br>
You're very pretty and intelligent Constipator, so I believe in you. <br>

My nuts, as well as my cock, are far from being numb and are also fully functional w/out the need for any type of drug or medial treatment; jealous much? <br>
<br>
And refresh rate does mean how many times a image is "drawn" or "displayed" per second? - right? - Thats what "Hertz" means right? cycles per second? <br>
And when a VGA renders a image of a 3D application, it does so in frames, so "FPS" stands for "frames per second" - right? <br>
and yah, CRT's would flicker when your FPS dropped below your refresh rate, or so I was told by people who used 150Hz monitors in the q3 days... <br>
Whereas a LCD or LED display would just have the same image displayed and you would just notice a lack of smoothness or something and it would NOT be as eye-bleeding bad. <br>
Am I somewhat-right so far? <br>
<br>
So when I am playing an open-world/highly-demanding game like Crysis and I notice such a lack of smoothness on my Display, it has nothing to do with the fact I just suffered a fps drop of 25 frames from 100 to 75? <br>
And when that same game seems "smooth as butter" as I look at the sky and the MSI Afterburner tells me I am @ the vertical-sync'd max of 120fps (for my particular <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236104&amp;Tpk=Asus%20VG236He" class="postlink">Display</a>), it has nothing to do with the fact that I am aiming at a helicopter which is the only thing my PC has to render in that instance?<br>
Nothing at all? FPS lag is a myth? Like global warming or climate change? <br>
Please enlighten me further Impala, and try to refrain from referencing male genitals and how they feel to you. 'tanks.  <br>
When did you have a chance to feel my nuts anyhow? I usually charge 300$ per hour for that kind of shit.<br>
<br>
- Anywho -<br>
<br>
I was fairly certain that there WAS a correlation between FPS and Refresh Rate.<br>
Much like how Nutri-Grain was all proud about his new i7 machine getting 1000fps in lockdown only to learn via Deathwish that he was only seeing the effective "FPS" of his LCD display's vertical-refresh-rate which was, and currently is still, @ 75hz. <br>
The VGA rendering 1000 frames a second, the LCD displaying the entire screen's image at a rate of 75 times a second. This OK? Seem right at all?<br>
This subject has been covered a-whole-fucking-lot on these forums and the debate was not over FPS to Refresh-Hertz but whether or not the human eye could tell the difference between actual 60fps and 120fps (or above that). <br>
I even recall Fearsome saying something along the lines of "you should not buy an expensive-ass display if you can't afford the PC hardware to Render images at the speed of the Display, if you want to fully enjoy your shit that is." Prolly less profane, but you all get the idea. My dick is small. <br>
I am fairly certain that Constipator wants to use this display, or any new one of any brand, for everything and enjoy it fully including a dead-ass game of hl2dm.<br>
For the record, my friends TV was a LCD one w/ LED back-lit crap - whatever that means.<br>
<br>
I am pretty sure my own eye's don't lie: <br>
hl2dm seems much smoother on this 120Hz display over any other one I have used, CRT or otherwise. <br>
If I set my fps_max value BELOW 110, I noticed the game being less smooth. If I have no fps cap and it ranges from 340-670, I notice no sort of defamation of game-play/smoothness. <br>
In ANY game I can tell a difference between &lt;30 fps, 40:50 fps, from 50:60, from 60:75, from 85:100, and from 100:110. I do not see a difference in like 112:119 or above.<br>
The entire time my Video cards say my Display is at 1920x1080p @ 120Hz. P means progressive scan right? No Interlaced crap, eh?<br>
Borderlands seems 10x smoother on my PC than on the PS3 version being displayed by the aforementioned 240Hz TV, for many console games are locked @ 30 fps. <br>
But for the "sake of fucking," they are "no-way related," or is Impala mistaken?<br>
<br>
Can someone who knows their shit clear this up for me?<br>
Much like when my undergrad Biology Professor said the human eye CANT detect anything over 75hz, which I believed and then found to be fucking wrong in another thread, I hate it when people pretend to know shit and allow me to regurgitate it upon others only to look like a complete fool. <br>
Fucking old people piss me off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Stop talking about CRTs altogether. They play no part in this discussion about LED. They are an entirely different technology. <br>
<br>
LEDs refresh individual pixels as they are needed to change and only when they are needed to change. The HERTZ you speak of is update, how often the monitor updates information from the frames. It STILL changes pixels individually.<br>
Like dark areas, maybe they don't change for X seconds.<br>

No matter what I did, no custom or PC resolution would display any kind of image on my test-HDTV in both the analog-PC connector as well as the HDMI ones. <br>
The max Refresh Rate in the HD/SD category is 60Hz; I surmise this based on the fact that it was the only option available in the drag-down menu and how the TV's menu said the input source was 1920x1080p@60hz. <br>
<br>
It could be that the 240hz TV is newer and does not include such legacy support for the PC port and crap. Then again I don't know shit.<br>
If you care to know, I can find out the model-specific info on that samsung TV and post it at some point. <br>
I also have a riviaTuner mod and SLI going on so there are other variables that may be fucking me. <br>
It is not like I would care to disable SLI to use a 120/240hz TV - how the fuck would I play any DX11 game with even average/low settings @ at least 240 fps on a single card? <br>
<br>
This now brings me to Impala: <br>
Thank you for the info, for I did not now how LED's differed in their display method of pixels and such. <br>
Even though the LED is not drawing the entire screen in one pass like a CRT (in progressive scan), it would still update nearly all the pixels on that screen if you do a 360 spin or something and would be deriving that visual-information from your VGA/PC. <br>
The display receives this information in Frames-Per-Second, and its been that way for quite some time. Silly goose.<br>
<br>
It seems we were "arguing" about two different things: I thought you were saying that it was solely up to the display as to how smooth a game appeared and FPS played no part at all, and you thought I was saying that FPS will change how a display would *display* its images/environments.  <br>
If, however, that actually is what you were saying: I call morons upon you.<br>
<br>
If I spent 300$ on this Monitor and had not the PC to have at least 120 fps in all my games, it would be a waste; Waste is bad, and its why I bring it to the attention of a guy, who prefers to waste-not, like Constipator. <br>
So Constipator would WANT 120hz on a 350$ TV for games, if it will work. <br>
120hz in an environment, like what you find in video games, when you are perceiving depth is much more "immersive" and WORTH the cash than fucking Movies or TV shows @ the same display/refresh rate. <br>
On a 60Hz display, I could not tell a difference in FPS above 60, k?  <br>
<br>
So yes, as Pern said the entire screen on a LED can be refreshed at a maximum of the listed specification. HL2dm @ 120hz (provided the test PC is always over 120fps) should "feel" the same on my 120Hz LCD as it would a 120Hz CRT. <br>
How it would actually *look* would obviously be different, but the same feel while flying around in-game should be consistent on both technologies. <br>
Or so I would think.<br>
You could argue that CRT's are inferior, since you would get a gay-ass flicker if your FPS dropped below the value of the Refresh rate. This would be due to the fact that the CRT display would have no image to draw at that particular split-second moment. <br>
Am I right people like Ko-Tao, Pern, and Deathwish?<br>
LCD or LED crap would just leave the previous image within the pixels and you would just feel the lag of a shitty PC, hence "fps lag." <br>
Now I am repeating my shitty self. Apologies.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I noticed a huge difference in a move from a 1600x1200@75Hz CRT to a 1440x900@60Hz-5ms LCD in 2005. <br>
It was positive in favor for the LCD display, since It caused less eye-bleeding and seemed more "smooth" w/ my shitty PC. <br>
<br>
Why is the Samsung monitor listed @ 120Hz but your VGA input is only @ 60hz?<br>
Is it a real monitor or a HDTV like what I tried to fuck with? <br>
<br>
I will say that 60hz on this display feels like a joke compared to 120hz max, especially on a well-made open game like Red Faction Guerrilla. <br>
Once you play real fps's @ 120Hz, you will want nothing less; I did fucking tolerate it on Crysis, 'casue I mean yah - not like I am starving w/ aids in Africa or something. <br>
Still, you will be more anal (tee-hee) about it and will work to mod Unreal Engine games (to remove the FPS smoothing that locks the games @ 62fps) and such. <br>

There is no doubt twice the updates may give some margin of better performance.<br>

i doubt one would even notice, but if they psychologically think it's better, than it is, in their minds.<br>
But thanks for helping prove my point that the new technology does not work like the old.<br>
LEDs do not refresh entire frames. They translate frames into a an ever changing matrix of separate pixels.<br>
And twice the refresh will give some technical improvement, if the pixels can keep up the speed of change.<br>
<br>
Still, none of this applies to Card FPS or FPS lag or whatever.<br>
And refresh rates in Hertz for a CRT do not apply to LEDs.<br>
<br>
So, i never did state there is no performance difference between 60 and 120 updates per second on a an LED, now did i!?!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also, it is not my point that blurring caused by...has anything to do with refresh rate...<br>
<br>
My point is that blurring occurs when scenes spin 180 fast, regardless of high update rates and fast pixels.<br>
Let me explain. Spinning fast in the game isn't going to become unblurry because your monitor updates a million times a second.<br>
If you spin quickly in real life, ie a scene flies by at high speed, it's going to blur regardless of your monitor, your card, your hertz, your update rates.<br>

Lets think about this part of the equation impala for a second. There are some games played where you may want ultra realism,<br>
and then there are some games you may play where you do not want ultra realism, you want ultra performance and every little <br>
advantage you can get such as no blurring, no tearing and the images rendered as ultra fast and consistent as technologically possible.<br>
<br>
This being a HL2DM forum and a game where most players are pretty competitive, I think comparing what you see on your monitor to real life is an invalid argument.<br>
Of course in real life you are going to see motion blur but the point is that it can be eliminated when using certain types of setups for gaming. No matter how little of<br>
an advantage that might be to each individual, it remains just that an advantage.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hmmmm no not that i know of, if ur frame rate drops ur screen still displays at the same refresh rate it just starts to display frames longer depending on how long they are up, like 1 frame is displayed twice then the next thrice, or i allways thought this atleast.<br>
I never noticed any flicker or anything at all while playing at 100-160hz with fps drops.<br>
<br>
And argumentaliser, playing games at 160hz u can see a difference, big time, especially faster paced games like cpma, and cpma being on an old engine its easy to keep a constant 160 frames per second to match.

When you look at a screen you're looking at a 2D plane. You perceive depth, but you're eyes are focused on the surface of the screen no matter what the game inside does. That's why a lot of FPS games now blur the background when you're reloading to put the focus on your gun. If you just look at your gun in a game like HL2DM you can still see the rest of the map perfectly.<br>
Also, there's no peripheral vision when you're playing a game. Your peripheral vision works completely different then your center vision, and probably contributes to blur more then anything else.<br>
<br>
I'm no eye specialist but its pretty obvious that these situations aren't the same.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

To close, the average is never going to notice any difference.<br>

I am not saying there is NO difference. I am saying who gives a fuck, most won't notice, this stuff is for nerds, the advantage you think it might give is negligible.<br>
All the while, real people are trying to make real decisions with their money and a few elite gamers are telling then X doesn't perform the Nth degree. Who cares.<br>
Anyone that is arguing CRTS now is just weird.<br>
Lacking common sense.<br>
<br>
Punk referred to adding REALISM to games. Realism, as in reality.<br>
Like i said, all a sensible person has to do is spin around 180 and see if they see the entire scene without blur.<br>
NO, YOU CANNOT, because the brain cannot take in but so much info at a time.<br>
<br>
120 hertz will not get anyone one extra kill.<br>
120 hertz may perform on paper better than 60 but not TWICE as good.<br>
<br>
This is my point. 2ms 60 hertz monitors perform fine and look great for 99% of folks.<br>
For Punk, and KoTao and Pern, stay with your CRTs and stop acting like 120 hertz is twice as good.<br>
LEDs don't work like CRTs. 60 times a second is fast. 120 will not make your eyes see twice as fast.<br>

False, even my sister can see the difference and she aint no gamer. The thing is, it will net u more kills assuming ur practiced, ofcourse u need to be comfortable with ur mouse and watnot but take someone who is very practiced and talented(and to be honest they only need to be decent or half decent) and compare their performance on 60hz to 120+ and they will be notably better on 120+ easily. Now while u might argue that this proves ur point about being a practiced/pro gamer the other advantages with 120+ is smoother animations, clarity of textures during movement, yada yada yada. The best way to describe it is ....simply, YOU SEE MORE.<br>
So lets say u have 2 monitors that are exactly the same, both very high quality, fine dot pitch, 1 @ 60hz, the other @120, which one do u think will look better graphically? YEP thats correct, the second.<br>
There are alot of ppl out there who appreciate quality who arent pro gamers. So theres plenty of reason to go 120+ if u has the cash to spare without care.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

"Frame rate, or frame frequency, is the frequency (rate) at which an imaging device produces unique consecutive images called frames. The term applies equally well to computer graphics, video cameras, film cameras, and motion capture systems. Frame rate is most often expressed in frames per second (FPS), and is also expressed in progressive scan monitors as hertz (Hz)."<br>

<br>
frame rate, and hz, same shit fool.<br>

Did you see roughly your peripheral vision at 12 Oclock and then the same at 6?<br>
Did you notice you do not really see to the side clearly? That is your BRAIN working with your eyes.<br>
Now try something else. Place your hand up 45 degrees to your head out as far as you can.<br>
Now, looking forward, like an FPS, sweep your hand across to the other side and tell us what you saw.<br>
Now, do the same thing and follow your to the other side.<br>
What did you see?</div></blockquote>

How is this test relevant? I see wat my eyes focus on, having background and foreground scenery blur for being in and out of focus could be an effect in games in the future u know....<br>
If i focus on my hand and move it really fast, back an forth the same way i see my hand very clearly and the background is blurry. But the fact that i can make out every detail on my hand while its moving that fast proves my point.<br>
Also spinning around its the same thing, i see wat my eyes focus on as im spinning, i was spinning my head just now and while doing it i can still make out the brand name on my fan, theres no blur persay though to read really small writing i would have to stop and focus a bit, but once again, thats focus, wat the fuck are u even trying to argue here by crapping on about a test that shows how your eyes focus?<br>
<br>
Considering your eyes dont have to refocus constantly while staring at a screen makes it very easy to discern the difference.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

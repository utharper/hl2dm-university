the pistol and killing people (not noobs) who were shooting him with a shotty and mag.  When I tried to spectate him he stopped.<br>
<br>
I have seen a few speedhax.<br>
<br>
I know of a few people that have scripts for combining sprint, jump and crouch in an attempt to jump.  It is an easy bind to pick out as it just looks jerky and lame.  Maybe its a bad bind, I don't know but,they really aren't  harder to kill with it.   It doesn't give them an advantage especially agianst a legit jumper/hopper so its kinda useless.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm positive on at least 3.  The vid above, a regular player on a low grav server (spins in mid-air w/o animation...followed by headshot) I no longer frequent, and a guy from a fairly well known clan (but I think he got kicked out) that has no representation on this forum.  I'm not going to list names here to avoid any flaming shit.<br>
<br>
I think it might be more prevalent than we think.  As I understand the aimbots, there are a variety of settings?  Like, level 5... guarenteed headshot every time!  Level 1, some headshots, but might take two shots instead of one.  Maybe only certain weapons can be turned on/off.  Pure speculation on my part.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

makes me kinda happy this game is under apreciated as the people who write hacks didn't do them for this game? <br>

I think there's a video of something similar to that somewhere on youtube.... shows a guy running normally (not bhopping) at like 2000 vel on a low grav server getting headshots left and right from across the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm not too surprised considering that you lead the clan who held the most popular server for over two years.<br>
<br>
Source hacks work for every source game. HL2DM is just too unpopular for it to become a prime target for griefers and hackers. Heck, the worst griefers are probably us. We ruin the game experiences of the lesser skilled by pwning them <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

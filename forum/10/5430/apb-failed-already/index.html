	<div class="content">lol, I knew 5 mins into the beta that the game would tank.  They hyped the hell out of the player customization thing, which was nice, but then put the nice customized character into a complete shit game with a shitty environment, shitty cars, and shitty missions.  They also promised there would be no subscription fee, then decided you would have to buy minutes.  <br>
I hate it too, because I really would like to see a game like GTA4 multiplayer, but one that would work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If I was blizzard, I'd have offered 3 dollars and asked for at least 50 cents back.  That game is shit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So glad I didnt waste good money on this game.  This just makes me lol, because yeah they put all their emphasis into the character customization.  So what?!  So my character looks really cool and awesome, but if the content, the meat of the game is lame and boring, whats the point.  Just goes to show that gamers are looking for more besides eye candy.  Hopefully the game developers take notice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

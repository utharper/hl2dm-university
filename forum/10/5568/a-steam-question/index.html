If you want to know why, remember Valve's policy at free stuff like hl2dm <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br>
Also in 7/10 cases of Steam hanging I see it uploading a few megabytes of some crap visible on the speed meter. Looks like Valve spy users. I read that they gather info about installed software: OS, browsers, torrents  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/spy.gif" width="21" height="22" alt=":spy:" title="Spy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Not only that it just does it as soon as it reaises there is an update, recently whilst steam was running in the background and browsing the net I  wondered why everything is going so slow, I eventually found out Steam is downloading a 2.6GB patch to Bad company2 every other piece of software i use asks if I want to download the latest update and only if I select YES does it happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

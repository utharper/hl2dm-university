Hi Everybody,<br>
<br>
Some of you may be already acquainted with The Council Mapping Forum over at <a href="http://hl2mapping.30.forumer.com" class="postlink">http://hl2mapping.30.forumer.com</a> and the mapping releases done there and the mapping support that is offered.  I am glad to announce that The Council Mapping Forum will now be hosted as part of the TSF Clan Forum, with special thanks to Lord Davros and Ravage at TSF.  The Council Mapping Forum will continue to operate as has always done, only now as part of the TSF Clan.  Therefore bringing more people together to share ideas, talk about maps and mapping and play new maps.<br>
<br>
So, just to re-acquaint with the format, you are invited to register with the TSF Forums and share the benefits of being part of a HL2DM community and also a part of a mapping hub, where you may post any questions you have about mapping, or share your work, or experience first hand new creations coming the forum.<br>
<br>
The New Council Mapping Forum is hosted here:<br>

<br>
Important Note:<br>
<br>
The current Council Mapping Forum will remain open as an archive, members may find information there if needed, but everything that is needed will be hosted on the TSF Forums.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

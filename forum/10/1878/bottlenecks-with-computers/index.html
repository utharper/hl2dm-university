<br>
No pint gettign a super 9800GTX and stickign it in a P4 3Ghz becasue the processor will create a bottlekneck that is to say the processor cannot send the card enogh frames to be rendered so no matter the resolution the FPS will always be the same.<br>
likewise for my AMD x2 4800 I thin I have hit a limit it can go with an 8800GT any card higher willbe limited by the processor especially in source games whic are known to use lots of CPU</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ameritech is doing you dirty on the connection speed BI.<br>
<br>
I recommend you get a decent pci network card I noticed a difference when I changed from onboard to a network card it's worth the money.<br>
<br>
Good strong video card = decent performance on most games but with slow RAM and or CPU you'll notice the game have a really hard time loading and getting to the point of smooth gameplay, and source games seem especially cpu reliant.<br>
<br>
Just try to get parts that get along no need to spend a left nut on a cpu, look for the sales going on and work yourself out a deal.<br>
<br>
I recommend you get together a rough list of what you are thinking of buying, post it here for a comparison and we can make sure you get what you want performance wise, if you have a hard time deciding, but after you build this one you are going to find the whole process much easier I know I did.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You could probably build one for about $2K total.   That estimate includes 1 video card (you could use the one you got since you already have it).   You might also be able to use the CD drive, etc that your current computer has.    Depending on what you have for a hard drive you might also be able to reuse that or at least use it as a storage drive.  That would save you some money.  <br>
<br>
You could get a good processor and motherboard for about $500.  You already have the vid card.  Just have to see what you would need for power if the current unit you have isnt big enough.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well in that case yeah $1500-$2000 and some elbow grease you can make a great gaming PC, it won't be any E3 showoff uber PC but I see no reason you couldn't build a PC with that money capable of running even the newest games near max, considering parts are so cheap now.<br>
<br>
These online PC distributors like newegg and others make it easy and you can get some combo deals that are actually worth it and what you need, The thread we had earlier in the year, about the discount gaming PC's would be a great place to start and get an idea those were some great setups posted and good price too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

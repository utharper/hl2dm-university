<br>
Kimbo is not a MMA fighter. He has never fought anyone of any meaning. A few internet videos of backyard brawls may qualify you as a tough bastard, but that does not make you a top athlete in the sport of MMA.<br>
<br>
Kimbo has been training hard to try to make the transition, but in the sport today it is extremely tough to do that if you are past a certain age and don't come from at least a wrestling/grappling or full contact background (and be dominant in it typically also). Here we see an epic display of poor technique. Keep in mind that this event is not even the big league yet and Kimbo is basically a joke.<br>

He didn't seem to prove he could murder the other guy, and even if you say he wasn't knocked out, leaving a guy confused is more than enough, all you need is just keep hitting until he is finally down ... he is not gonna do much while he is still shocked because of the hits...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">geez, So Dana Whire (UFC Prez) was complaining that the kimbo slice fight set MMA back 5 years, and in part he is right.  <br>
<br>
I was watching PTI on espn and Wilburn? or whoever was thinking that the fight was fixed (Because Kimbo got dropped by someone's brother-in-law) and that MMA is likely all fixed. Sucks that he doesn't understand that Elite XC is the bottom tier league of MMA and Kimbo was a terrible fighter who only beat a few street drunks, and two of the worst fighters in the worst MMA league.  Not to mention one would have won if his ear wasn't the size of a tennis ball.   I wish ESPN had a clue,  They had a few interviews with Rampage Jackson. Due to the popularity of UFC.  A few cover stories on Kimbo helping CBS over hyping him.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

granted it was a very bad marketing strategy to try and base your organization around a street fighter with no actually mma skills / experience but the majority of the other organizations out there are legit organizations with legit fighters that are just trying to stand up to the ufc tyrant... which isnt likely, but is good for new and upcoming stars to come to the ufc <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Oh I know, but my point is putting someone in that the public likes that can't actually fight is the first step in that direction. I must admit I was a bit afraid when shamrock went over there and then when he came back he was doing stupid dramatic shit like grabbing the mic and going on a big rant about his opponent.

Yea while your about I was wondering if there was one to come how many maps are you allowed to enter? Because I have about 3 in which I would like to enter... you know if its going to happen...<br>
<br>
But yea I think this would be great, I don't even care if there isn't a prize.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So why not find someone that does? If all the old board members/admns dont have time to do anything anymore or arent interested in this game why not find some new ones? <br>
<br>
I'm not interested in running one nor being a board member just to run one but I think there are more then a few people out there who might be willing. I would donate some money toward a new contest, like 25 or 50.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok but that's the point, if all the old adminship is too busy to be bothered with this game  (so what's the point of them anymore?) why not get some new people in to oversee it. I just offered to throw $50 down for it, if we get alot of entries I'll raise it. There's a problem, ok but theres always solutions to the problem. Maybe vitamin could be appointed to oversee it or someone who has good knowledge of maps.<br>
<br>
Every contest has produced at least 1-2 standard popular maps of choice, I'd like to see at least one more before this game comletely dies off and N.A. CU comes to a close.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I totally agree, it will be good to do this before the game dies off, as it already has begun... For the organizer I wouldn't know who would do it really. Seems like more people are getting busier...<br>
I'm not sure whether or not we need a big money prize either, though I guess even a small amount will get people back into mapping for deathmatch. And Pernicious, a judge, pfft!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok...well Pern has volunteered to be our moderator if this goes through which will be fine, I think he will be active enough. Hopefully WT will see a PM if this kicks off to post an announcement. I mean all along I could circumvent HL2DMU and go with clans-united where I have more control, moderation and more traffic, but I'm trying to keep this website balanced in terms of traffic as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well, as i said b4, im willing to do this with you and possibly donate some money, but i would like to do it as a "pub/comp mapping contest"  with you(or vitG) overseeing the comp section and myself and somebody else overseeing the pub section. that way the contest will cater to both.  contestants can sign up and may submit as many maps as they want, for either the pub and/or comp section.  contests have different sections for submition all the time.  now we will have captured the attention of everybod in the community, not just one group.  after we have an official announcement, which i would be willing to draft up, stealing WT's contest rules and editting them to the style of this contest, we will see how many mappers sign up and then go from there.  and yes blas, three maps in the last 3+ years have made it into the rotation of league play.  3 out of the hundreds that have been made, Valar only has a ton of comp style maps that have gone nowhere in league play.  on the flip side, it seems new pub maps are used constantly, and ppl actually enjoy them.  so there's my proposal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
im not sure i'll be manning up with money this time.  i think para and i donated 2/3rds of the prize money last time.  i'd like to see some other folks step up with monetary donations this time around.  of course money is tight for everyone i'm sure... so any kind of time commitment is also appreciated (judge, playtest, etc.).<br>
<br>
as chem mentioned, im not sure why the comp maps don't get much love from these contests.  but the pub side seems to.  the FF servers have been particularly good at picking up maps from this website and running them on their servers.<br>
<br>
the overall quality of many of the maps  (contest or not) posted here lately has been quite impressive.  its a shame that as the game see's fewer players, the mapping quality has been stepped up.  not that Val and Pig haven't been making quality maps forever... there just seems to be some real devotion to map making by a variety of people lately.  i think Val and Pig have set the bar high and developing mappers have met the challenge.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2629&amp;hilit=mapping+contest" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... ng+contest</a><br>
Might be some guidelines you could follow there, Monday.<br>
<br>
Copypasta from that thread. <br>
<br>
1. Map must be an original work (this means you cannot submit a remake of an existing map from HL2DM or any other game) and be completed to prefinal level. Map must be previously unreleased and must remain so for the duration of competition. Mapmaker must agree to allow HL2DMU to release their map as part of the winning trio mappack before promoting it publicly.<br>
<br>
2. Mapper must submit .vmf, .bsp, and final compile log for review (.vmf files will only be used to assess technical issues by judges with mapping ability and will not be retained once the contest is over). Email a link to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee9d879a8b8f8a838780ae8682dc8a83c39b8087988b9c9d879a97c08d8183"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ccbfa5b8a9ada8a1a5a28ca4a0fea8a1e1b9a2a5baa9bebfa5b8b5e2afa3a1">[email protected]</span></a>. Please do not email the files, just provide a URL (filefront etc). You should receive a confirmation email. If you do not, please post on the forums and arrange an alternative method of submission. You are also welcome to submit as much information about the design of your map as you see fit if you think it will help the judges understand the motivation behind your design and the gameplay it was designed to encourage.<br>
<br>
3. Deadline for map submission is February 28th 2009. Maps received after this date will not be considered.<br>
<br>
4. The HL2DMU Judges Panel consisting of volunteers from community will vote privately to determine the top three maps, and a second vote will be held to determine the winner and runner up from those three.<br>
<br>
6. Judges are not permitted to enter a map, or participate in the contest in any manner besides judging.<br>
<br>
7. Map must be made specifically for regular HL2DM by Valve. It must not be made for a mod based on HL2DM, nor should it be a capture the flag, nokill, or co-op style map (or any other non-standard deathmatch style of play). While team spawns are permitted, they are not recommended.<br>
<br>
8. Map must run on windows and linux servers. If you do not have a linux server to test on, submit your map anyway and HL2DMU will try to assist you with any bugs that cause linux crashes during the testing and judging stage.<br>
<br>
9. Map must be fully packed. The only other files that may be included with the .vmf and .bsp are a readme.txt and a .res file that points to it.<br>
<br>
10. LDR lightmaps are required. Maps that are fullbright or have HDR lightmaps only will not be considered.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Don't think so. It will be a shame if this OB version doesn't get played. All the bitching and moaning about Valve not updating dm and here is a guy that puts it right in our face with easy access to suggestions, updates and feedback. Anyone that bitched about Valve not caring for hl2dm is a hypocrite if they don't start using this mod exclusively when it's at a proper playable stage. Why continue to support a shitty version of a game that Valve cares nothing for by continuing to play it?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

QFT!<br>
I have still been testing new versions of Sub's OBE mod on an almost daily basis. As of today I can report that pretty much everything is fixed that needs to be and the last thing he is working on before making another release is to get the animations right for the movement. This mod plays so smoothly at this point I personally will likely play the mod and no longer play regular hl2dm once it's finished. If the player base does not move over to this mod, well then I will likely be done with hl2dm until hl3 arrives.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's not really a big deal, the only thing out of the ordinary is that the tf2 or orange box binaries need to be installed on the server as well as the mod. I know fatpipe will do it and I have also got conformation from game servers that they will also do it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ill agree with that. Ill also agree with valar. Ill also say that everyone needs to step it up a notch and get the OB version and start playing it instead of this old Valve shit we are used to. It just takes a small leap of faith kids.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think reason that these mods aren't the huge success that they should be is because a lot of players are too stuck in their ways and afraid of change, most experienced players know all the bugs and are use to how shit this games feels (in terms of bugs not gameplay), so they're afraid that if they change to Pro or OB they won't have the same advantage as they do now. I wouldn't necessarily say that all players were lazy as there is a certain degree of hassle involved with mod which doesn't exist in a retail game, so I can see why a lot of people are put off by them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You can turn off the Pro Gameplay and set it as Regular HL2DM, you can even choose if play with regular HL2DM's bugs or not, lol.<br>
<br>
Most of advanced players customize their HUD or xhair, well, you can do it ingame in HL2DMPro. You boost server perfomance by not using addons nor plugins, because the damn mod has an admin panel in it.<br>

after playtesting for a month for regular gameplay they add a retarded game mode to the pro side that completely broke the regular hl2dm mode.  With matches that week everyone was forced to switch back to normal.<br>

A lot has changed since 1.6, the bummer about mods is that they are all a work in progress and people expect everything to be perfect every time which is sad because regular hl2dm to this day is bugged to hell and back and the netcode sucks ass.<br>
<br>
I think the current version is pretty decent although I still feel like the new netcode they are using could use some tweaking, that said it is no worse than regular hl2dm. It will be interesting to see what the OBE version does to promod, in anycase players need to try these mods and judge for themselves and not just for 5 minutes. I have a pro server and it dosn't get much use but was a special deal for me at 7.00 a month so I keep it. Later at night a group of players mostly from the US comes in a plays the different games and I have good times playing the tournament and some other modes when they are on it. All I can say is those who don't try other things are missing out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If I recall correctly, for the original pro, you didn't need to install anthing special to play it?  I remember accidentally going into a server once and the settings were very fast and the weapons were way overpowered compaired to vanilla.  Might of been some other modification but I remembr them saying it was "pro"  <br>
<br>
I really have to wonder if mods don't catch on more because the arent backed/promoted/endorsed by a major game company so the don't get the marketing/exposure/attention/distribution that the versions that are made by the companies do.  Also with new mods one has to wonder if there will be ongoing development/support/upgrades to keep the mod going.  Might make some people gun shy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

1. There are 7,000 versions of crossfire.  <br>
2. it could be the same version since pro would run it.<br>

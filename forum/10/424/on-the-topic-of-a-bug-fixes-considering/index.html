	<div class="content">considering the fact that people want this game to run like it should, i was thinking that of all bug fixes, no one ever cared to think that the automatic realoding was a bug. typically, this would be a big bug, but for some reason all you hl2dm fans enjoy the shit out of it. imagine if it wasnt there. imagine playing dm for years and not having that type of advantage. what if there was no auto reload? i think things would be more fair.....<br>
<br>
but dont ever send this bug in <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Most competitive players are used to manually reloading everything but the 357 anyway, so its not going to be too much of a change. Therell be a few free kills here and there as someone pulls out an unloaded mag and cant fire, but i think the more interesting thing to come of this may be an end to the reload bugs that have plagued various weapons since the games release.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I love the automatic reloading, didn't know it was a bug D:<br>
It allows deadly weapon combinations almost everytime, and makes the game quicker, by not having to wait reloading every weapon.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">it's a bug..... no need to reload the shotgun, 357, smg, x-bow.<br>
<br>
ar2, pistol works fine. <br>
<br>
Oddly enough when you drop the shotgun/357 you pick it up with the same unreloaded stat and the ar2/rpg come completely loaded even if the dead person had used every bullet/rocket<br>
<br>
but like onti said it's one of those bugs that speeds up the game and hl2dm players want the most speed in the game</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm a little confused here, automatic reloading?  Are we talking when you run out of ammo in that clip and it automatically reloads (like it has always been that I know of), or for example, shooting a couple rounds with .357 - switching to a different weapon then back to .357 - now the .357 is full again??

that was one of the things vavle requested a demo of during Fios (althou with b-hopping, fast shotty, multi-push), and said it was within the engine, they did take out multi pushing it by using scroll which they did take out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That being said, if they just port the current game over to the orange box with all the bugs and exploits, I'll call it quits with HL2DM for good.<br>

I've got better things to do with my time than to always remember to aim where the player was in order to register a hit.  I'm really hoping they overhaul it as they convert.<br>

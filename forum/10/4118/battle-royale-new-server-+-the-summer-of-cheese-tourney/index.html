Server info-<br>
name: //BATTLE ROYALE\\ - The Last Man Standing Server<br>
ip: 69.28.220.181:27015<br>
type: <a href="http://www.fatpipeserver.com" class="postlink">Fatpipe</a> 8-man chicago pub stock settings<br>
rotation: aim arena reloaded, democracy, bathroom crazy v3, joyride, feudal (subject to change)<br>
features: 20 min map time, hit sounds, voting, sv_pure 0, <a href="http://battleroyale.hlstatsx.com" class="postlink">hlstatsx</a><br>

<br>
Contest info-<br>
<br>
Month 1:<br>
start date 3:00 pm June 10<br>
end date 3:00pm  July 10<br>
<br>
This is my way of giving back to the community. I know it's not much, but I wanted to find some way to thank the players who are still on and playing regularly. You are what keeps this game alive! The winner will be the player who's steam id is ranked 1 on the server's HLstatsX page. Prize will be sent through PAYPAL ONLY! Admins are ineligible to win. <br>
<br>
Griefing or blatant stat whoring will NOT BE TOLERATED. If you see anyone causing trouble on the server, and you feel they should be warned/banned, record a demo and send it to me asap. I reserve the right to ban or disqualify anyone at my own discretion. <br>
<br>
Please feel free to link to this on other active forums that you think might be interested. All are welcome!<br>

<br>
So far a lot of people have commented on how smoothly the server runs. It also has most of the competition maps in its map list. If you and a friend want somewhere to play and the server is empty, you could join and rtv to any map you wanted. :p Just a suggestion</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thank you to everyone who has come and played on the server.<br>
<br>
Due to the apparent lack of interest, and the fact that I've come to realize I have neither the time or interest in running a public server, I'm cutting the contest short.<br>
<br>
Congratulations!, As of right now the server rankings are as follows (<a href="http://battleroyale.hlstatsx.com/?mode=players&amp;game=hl2mp" class="postlink">http://battleroyale.hlstatsx.com/?mode= ... game=hl2mp</a>):<br>
<br>
1st place- Constipator<br>
2nd place- Vaporizor<br>
3rd place- Divinity<br>
<br>
Con, if you wish to receive the $20, just pm me your info and I'll send it asap<br>
All winners, you can pm me your steam id's and I'll set you up with admin.<br>
<br>
Once again, thanks very much to everyone who expressed and interest and showed up to support the server. <br>
Very soon, I am going to strip it of it's stats, hitsounds, etc. and turn it into a private match server. Everyone is welcome to use it (provided I don't hate your guts), just message me for the password. <br>

Yea, well... The server has been up for two weeks and it's been virtually empty the whole time. Sorry Herb. Maybe it's my fault for not spreading the word around and bugging people to play. But meh, I'm just not the kind of person who does that.<br>

Divinity and Impala, why don't you do us all a favor and keep inflammatory politics out of HL2DM U. I go to this sight to enjoy gaming gossip and talk, not get mixed up in, hatred, arguements and racism that all follow politics. Seriously Impala you look exactly like the Bush hating bots of 2005-09'. Your mindless hatred and arbitrary vile words you spew are as baseless and annoying as the far left liberals I've had to listen to for eight years. Wake up. To claim a man who grauated from Columbia and Harvard Law School and was essentially involved in politics his whole life has no idea what he's doing is absurd. Even if he was a clueless puppet dolt like George W. is the President can still operate effectively because of elite set of advisors and presidential cabinet that surround him that comes with the job. And yes, to finish it off politicians in the grande scheme of things are nothing more then puppets, decisions they make can only go so far, and the kind of decisions they make have already been predetermined for them by influences that the common man will never know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yes, i never really stopped tbh.  but i'm talking my 401k, mutual funds and such.  not day trading.  i was flipping out when my employer announced that i was going to be "forced" to sell my current portfolio of mutual funds and buy a single "retirement target date" fund instead.  but enough people raised hell, so i can at least ride out my current situation w/o changing from an orange to an apple.<br>
<br>
realistically, i don't see that i have a choice.  the market is a long term investment.  if i had sold my funds at the first drop in the markets and rolled them into an ira... maybe i would have saved some losses.  but im pretty sure most ira's are similar to 401k's in that they too are a series of choices in the mutual funds sector.<br>
<br>
i remember the days of certificates of deposit (CD's) that paid decent interest.  same with savings accounts or moneymarket accounts.  what happened to those days?  that troubles me greatly.  there is NO incentive to save.  the system works against you in that regard.  a few years back, you could "ladder" CD's of various interest rates and maturity dates into a 10 year plan that would practically guarantee you a better than 6% return on your initial savings.  those days are gone.  the markets are intended to be "investment", which historically cycles up and down.  its not intended to be a sole retirement vehicle.  people need incentives to save in order to have diversified retirement options.  <br>
<br>
seriously, its like someone is forcing me to accept "their" vision of what my retirement options should be.  wtf is up with that?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, as long as you are not retiring anytime soon, this correction will actually create more wealth for consistent investors. Being forced to change investments now into something "safer" is the worst thing you can do IMO, since you are simply locking in your losses and locking yourself out of buying at these cheaper prices. Don't let anyone do that to you, that's fear driven behavior, and just guarantees failure.<br>

Well hey it's better if someone just admits they hate leftists and therefore hates Barack Obama instead of throwing up wild and baseless accusations that he has no experience leading or doesn't know what he's doing which is subjective... If you really want to impress me on claims of Marxism and socialism point me out to specific votes or measures that he has supported that fall in line with Marxist theorum.

It actually works quite well where I am from. Much better than here, where the private insurance companies and medical industry have you by the short and curlies.

LFMAO State legislaturers are not leadership postions? I don't have time to explain specifics of a state legislature because I'm about to go to a party so I'll put it in laymans terms since that's all you can handle anyway. A state legislature's job is just about EXACTLY like a U.S. Representitive in the house of Congress. The work they do is less visible and not federal, meaning less news coverage and deemed of "smaller" consequence, but they log 60-100 hour work weeks with a 10-20+ full time staffed office with endless speeches, meeting with business leaders, city leaders all working to fix your local roads, fix your local sewage problems, fix your local schools and finding men to come pick up the 20+ cases of beer cans that your probably leave at your doorstep every tough Monday night. AND the HARVARD LAW REVIEW IS THE MOST CITED LAW REVIEW in the United States, cited by federal judges, district judges, and the U.S. F'N Supreme Court occasionally, the Harvard Law Review has a huge impact that an average person like you could have no comprehension of. Maybe when I get back I'll write a 2 page long post on the impact of the Harvard Law Review, actually on second thought for the sake of all the nice people here I won't do that. And I'll get to your other sensational claims tomorrow. GG Impala, just gg..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You and I have talked alot about politics so I wont get into much here, but I am all for Universal Health Care as long as it is properly implemented. The current system is retarded. Why would someone pay 25% of their paycheck for health care? That is currently what it would cost me at my current employer and they are a very large corporation. 25% dude. Id rather risk it and go without health care completely. <br>
<br>
Wanna know how screwed up the system is? If shit hit the fan and I was forced to go to the hospital for something that would give me a huge bill to pay, I would be allowed, through my current hospital, to use funding from them or (the taxpayer) to pay for 80% of my bills. Now, are you sure that this current system is the proper one? I technically would be getting more handouts in the current system then if there was Universal Health Care and probably costing the taxpayer even more $.<br>

Honestly, how many Canadians do you actually know/heard of that came here for medical care when they get it FREE in their own country? I'm married to a Canadian and have family there and I've never heard 1 single complaint that was health-care related. YES their taxes are a bit higher I've noticed that when I made purchases there but fuck man I don't know what American in their right mind wouldn't pay it for what they're getting. quti sounding like a neo-conservative.<br>
<br>
Haha gj using the poor of Mexico that come here cuz it's a river crossing or fence hop away. Obviously Mexico ain't taking care of their people that are in need and America isn't too concerned about it's borders so it's pure sense they would come here for a better life.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL ok now L2K wants some! OK I'm drunk but I'm still up to go blow for blow with anyone who wants a piece. L2K, Obama has specifically kept his promises during his presidential campaign so far with the exception of one issue. He has followed through and reversed 17 bush executive orders, out of the 200 some executive orders Obama promised to review over his 4 years of presidency. Prominantly he has kept his promise and reversed executive orders on stem cell research, gays in the military, environmental protection of the Pacific oceanic waters in the California bay area, abortion and Guantamo Bay and the use of off coast military torture. Every single one of these executive orders are monumental in the global eye and have kept true to Obama's specific word in campaign, the one promise he failed to specifically keep was a windfall tax on oil companies so far. You may ask well he promised to cut out earmarks completely but due to David Axelrod and his speechwriter he never once promised that specific event. Yes he has work to do and promises to live up to, and I'll be one of the first to call him out on the political blogs I go to.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, I would believe it, but it isn't working any better over here. We are basically under the thumb of the private insurance companies. There are so many exclusions and so much fine print, you never know how much something is going to cost you. Try this recent example:<br>
<br>
A few months back I took my wife to emergency. The hospital is "in her network", meaning it's fully covered by her insurance. So she goes in (takes about 5 hours to be seen for 15 mins by a doctor btw, 3 hrs in the waiting room and 2 hrs in a bed) and gets treated.<br>
<br>
The billing comes from the hospital and the insurance pays it. <em class="text-italics">Then we get a separate bill from the doctor that saw her for $1000.00.</em> We didn't get to choose the doctor who saw her as it was the ER, plus she was working inside an "in network" hospital. It's total BS. We are still fighting the charge. So far the insurance company has randomly paid half of it.<br>
<br>
Also, if you add the premiums we and our employers pay to the insurance companies and add it to out tax rate, I would hate to think how much it is actually costing us here. Health care here is a joke. I don't know the best solution, but something needs to be done.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">America's current healthcare system is TERRIBLE.  I pay $350 a month for a policy that doesn't even cover prescriptions.  I was charged $400 for a cholesterol test recently.  there are 47 million Americans who are screwed if they ever get sick or hurt because they don't have health insurance, and several millions more who are also screwed if they get sick or hurt because they are inadequately covered by their policies.  <br>
<br>
private insurance companies try to maximize profits (the logical and practical thing for any private corporation to do) by denying healthcare to as many people as they can.  if you have a "preexisting condition" --- which I would say most people on this forum probably do since the list of insurance companies' "preexisting conditions" could wrap around dm_lockdown 15 times over --- good luck even getting an insurance company to cover you.  even when you are covered they will look for any reason to deny your claims.  this is how they maximize profits.  the only people I can imagine being completely satisfied with this system are: CEO's of insurance companies, and insurance company lobbyists.<br>
<br>
by the way, the US is 37th in the world in health care.<br>

OK that is a good point, so he has reneged specifically on windfall taxes, pulling out the troops in 6 months and providing total transparency on all bills signed by his pen and relating to TARP, although he has gone FAR above the transparency Bush provided. You speak about Obama as if he's already finished and written off as a bad President, he's been in office 56 DAYS. One common thing I've noticed throughout most people throughout the political spectrum are the enormous expectations put on him, as if he's going be the single greatest modern U.S. President we've ever had, give it some time to flesh out, he's only just begun work on most of campaign promises and specifically health care.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Obama is full of ****. He always get a slam in on the prior admin, saying we have been given false choices between science and morality. Truth is, Bush outlined every facet of both sides of the stem cell debate and laid down a moral line to be crossed. He made a decision. There was one or the other.<br>
Obama makes NO decisions.<br>
He ran he was not going to allow torture, yet Leon Panetta has said that he would do the same thing Bush did, sign an order to waterboard a few select high value targets.<br>
And GITMO!?!?! WTF? Where is the common sense in closing Gitmo where they are and can be tried, and bringing those animals here?!?!?!<br>
Obama claimed a responsible transparent NEW way of doing business YET has an enemies list and goes after Rush Limbaugh!?!?! How stupid!<br>
On the Health Care, he has passed the whole thing to a study group, a group of folks in small groups coming up with ideas, like in HIGH SCHOOL!<br>
He talks about change and appoints the Clinton admin II. And tax cheats!<br>
His economic team is... GOLDMAN SACHS!!! Geithner from the FED/Goldman Sachs.<br>
At this clip, there is a projection 9 trillion in new debt over ten years.<br>
And every program in the current budget IS INCREASED EIGHT PER CENT!<br>
<br>
I suggest Obama slash programs and spending, Fix the toxic mortgage problem, strengthen the SEC, Grab a line item veto and scrub all the pork, Get some more people into Treasury, stop attacking nobodies like Rush and Hannity, fire his idiot press Sec., find some folks who pay their taxes, table all the socialist change for now, and LEAD!!<br>
<br>
My whole point was Obama is a LEFTIST, a far Leftist, therefore, he does not HAVE the equipment to govern from the center.<br>
He is President ACORN and is of the same minds as socialist agitprop. No ex-President has ever had mentors like Ayers and Wright.<br>
He is a radical and wants to change America from Land of Free (Liberty) to land of shared everything universal poverty/payback for injustice...<br>

There ARE reasons its expensive. A few:<br>
1. 14 Million illegals and countless others show up at the ER and are given free care. They don;t pay. The Hospitals go out of business and/or pass the cost to YOU, which passes it on to the Insurance companies.<br>
2. Ridiculous Law Suits rewards which drive up malpractice insurance to 150,000/year for a specialist!<br>
3. Government interference and regulations.<br>
4. Medicare and Medicaid UNDER PAYMENT, passing it on to you.<br>
5. FRAUD, which drives up costs.<br>
6. Restrictive FDA regs that drive up the costs of new drugs.<br>

The bottom line is this: the US is screwed.  We are past the point of no return.  Trillion is the new billion, and we are burning through those pretty quick now.  Once the implosion of debt structures runs its course, we will have hyper-inflation.  The middle class will be wiped out financially. The government will react like a cornered wounded animal to protect its interests, and it won't be pretty for those who love liberty.  These kinds of financial catastrophes always end the same way: war and tyranny, perhaps civil war.   I've been following this financial crisis for 9 years.  People were talking about Fannie failing over 5 years ago, and most just laughed at it.  People were talking about the rotting mass of credit default derivatives years ago.   This was all known by anyone paying attention, and willfully ignored by regulators because everyone was making money hand over fist.  If the average Joe understood how badly he is being raped right now, we would have riots on a daily basis.<br>
<br>
The key is to get past the fact that republican/democrat is a false dichotomy.  It's a way to divide us against ourselves.  The real dichotomy is the privileged elite and the rest of us.  We need to get rid of every one those SOBs in DC and start with a clean slate.<br>

<br>
But hey I don't know that much but all I know is what I see in documentaries and even if I gave a link someone like impala will just say the usual bs conspiracy.<br>
<br>
I may pay high taxes but at least I know that if me or anyone in my family get ill our national heath service will be there and won't punish us for the size of our pockets. I don't care what anyone says you can't put a price on life and everyone deservers there chance to have healthcare to fight for it.</div></blockquote>

I wonder how many of those awesome new drugs come from American companies?<br>
And what do you know about America, you live in Europe?<br>
I guarantee every single person who thinks Gubbmint health care is great is below the age of 30.<br>
There is not ONE case where the government provides better service or product for less money than the PRIVATE sector.<br>
Not one. Most of you folks have been educated in a system run and controlled by liberals.<br>
Even the debate is shallow. Are we talking about whether the health care is expensive or whether it is lousy!??!?<br>
Ours is expensive because it offers the finest techniques, drugs, training, and equipment in the world.<br>
Socialized Medicine offers universal care that rations supply to infinite demand. Long waits for Specialists and procedures are the norm. Socialized Medicine ALSO limits treatments. There are many things NOT covered and folks come here or to India for procedures.<br>
I was posted in Germany for two years and talked to many folks about health care. They told me the old were screwed! That they had a tiered system that de-prioritizes the aged.<br>
<br>
Documentary? How about FACTS.<br>
The government allows the poor to get free health care and they do not reimburse completely.<br>
We can fix health care without making it a Gubbmint run monopoly.<br>
<br>
Here is the crux of my argument which nobody has even addressed and i ask again: Why on earth would anyone in the states believe Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Obama and company are competent to design and implement an efficient cost effective high care Health Care system?!?!?!?<br>
Why? It doesn't make a lick of sense. Look at Social Security! Look at the CURRENT Debt?<br>
What makes folks want the gubbmint to get within miles of Health Care?!?!?<br>
Why would you want a government monopoly rather than choices.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: I am for more cost efficient health care.<br>
I believe it can be had without government run health care.<br>
If anyone wants to debate this issue, there it is.<br>

<br>
In the 21st century, health is a shared responsibility, involving equitable access to essential care and collective defence against transnational threats"<br>
<br>
United Nations!??! <br>
Socialism!??!<br>
Notice: "WHO is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system."<br>
And "health is a shared responsibility"<br>
<br>
READ it all again.<br>
<br>
America ranked 37th!?!?  What a JOKE. Just above Cuba!?  LMAO!<br>
Its the UN. They are worthless.<br>
I wonder if O-Dog read exactly HOW these rankings are made???<br>
<br>
The WHO findings are based NOT on the quality of care, but Life Expectancy, Percentage of GDP, and FAIRNESS.<br>
Life Expectancy is based on many factors, many more than just the health system.<br>
Fairness? The poor go the ER and get FREE CARE? Is that fair? Its FREE!<br>
<br>
Also not taken into account whatsoever is this important thing: ALL countries with Socialized health Care Systems ALSO have a PRIVATE Sector health economy supported by the same citizens!??!!<br>
Get my drift?<br>
It means there is a Public sector that is measured in GDP and responsiveness and Life expectancy and whole other black market of private care. Under the table tips, secret appointments...<br>
This is not measured.<br>
In a monopoly system that rations supply to infinite demand, there is ALWAYS a secondary under the counter economy that augments it!<br>
Where ever there is a market, money will flow!<br>
<br>
The big question is can we reform the system to cost less and not turn it over to idiot gubbmint bureacrats.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Fashionable? It's not fashion, it's reaction. Maybe over reaction, but reaction nonetheless. <br>
you wrote you don't have a tv, so maybe you don't see the panic going on around here, but people have lost confidence in big business. <br>
When crisis happens you expect something to be done. Correct? <br>
what annoys me about politicos is their hypocrisy.<br>
democrats = republicans with a different coat of paint. all promises and little real action.<br>
you name names on the one side of the aisle and absolve the previous administration? <br>
the earmarks for federal spending are not just for democrats, they all want their dicks wet... <br>

what i expect from our government if a certain amount of regulation to ensure as level a playing field as possible. when greed gets in the way of integrity am i supposed to remain complacent in the face of corruption? i agree financial privitization is the wrong road to follow.  <br>
i prefer to let the market decide who should fail or who should contiue to operate.<br>
however the market is skewed to keep the the illegally informed ahead of the regulators. the madoff scandal prooved how toothless and inept the SEC was and continues to be...can we agree the ones in power will contine to remain their in this two party system? <br>

real estate is finally undergoing a necesary correction, money as cheap as it ever has been. i'm hopefully buying a house and investing in my future in the coming months.  i've opened another money market account and a 529 college savings account for my daughter.  so i'm buying back into the system for the long term and hope i don't get burned.<br>

My main point is that Gubbmint CAUSED the Housing Bubble. Politicians protected Fannie Mae, Wrote the CRA, added quotas...  They pushed 100% No Qual, No Down Adjustable rate mortgages and pushed banks (along with Lawsuits from ACORN) into "community lending (Sub Prime). They pushed Fannie MAe into the Sub Prime market.<br>
They were in charge of regulating Wall Street and Derivative Trading/ Default Swaps.<br>

Gubbmint created the Housing bubble that popped like an atom bomb.<br>

	<div class="content">I think Bush's foreign policy will be ultimately remembered as a good thing and not the unequivocal evil the rabble has been associating with it. The 2003 invasion was a culmination of events spanning over the entire decade of the 90's. The U.N. was being made more and more a mockery by passing resolution after resolution that amounted to nothing, sent to search in dummy bunkers or dead ends, or just barred from carrying out inspections. I think that even if 911 hadn't occured, another Iraqi conflict was still just a question of when. But let's say it's a year and a half after 911 and you are assessing the threat. You know Saddam deceives inspectors, gives $20,000 checks to suicide bombers families etc. what do you do as President? Do you wait for another pointless resolution to be shat on? And at what expence if he has biological or chemical agents? Even if you Monday-morning quarterback it and say..BUT NO WMDS! go ahead and wind back the clock and play back the world sans any Iraq conflict. So does Iraq have chemical weapons today in 2009? Chemical &amp; bio agents were found, just not in the militarized or ready state we had believed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Of course W. made some big mistakes. The whole Mission Accomplished fiasco was probably the worst PR decision of his presidency and just gave the wrong image.  <br>
<br>
But what do we have to look forward in the future of all this? Iraq will in all likelyhood turn out to be a democratic nation, probably the best in the Palestinian world and a model for it. Iraqis won't have to worry about Bathists sticking them in an acid-tub or literally electrocuting their balls underground anymore. There won't be anymore wondering about what there government is hiding from the 'free world'. And basically, if there is any single man to thank for all of this it will be the man who has taken all the heat for it up till now, George W. Bush.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dont really care how much he spends because it is to early to tell if it's going to work. Do I really like that much spending? Hell no, but Im curious to see the outcome. The only reason Im not all up in arms about his spending is because he is spending it on the USA!!! Not some stupid country that nobody in the states gives a rats ass about. Im more conservative then liberal, but the republicans are no longer my party. They are not conservative. They spend damn near as much as the Dems, but they spend it on shit nobody cares about like wars in the middle east.

The media didn't report the true Obama. He is a complete narcissist. And Far Left. <br>
His head is full of half baked leftist nonsense.<br>
<br>
What is REALLY scary about him is his consistent attacks on Free Markets, Banks, and Investments. Notwithstanding the current meltdown that is really the governments fault, not all business people, banks, and firms are crooks.<br>
He even said he would try to dissuade young people from going into investments and banking and study SOMETHING USEFUL, like Engineering.<br>
<br>
The current AIG matter is yet another example of what is in store for us from the Left.<br>
The government was SUPPOSED to regulate credit markets and did not. They act to bailout AIG, which is a huge successful Insurance Co. with one very bad division. The employees SIGNED CONTRACTS. Congress wrote the loophole in and voted it! Obama signed the fucking thing!<br>
Now, folks are fine to go off about these bonuses but for Congress to act outraged? Ridiculous! Fucking ludicrous. Chris "The Lying Weasel" Dodd WROTE THE AMENDMENT HIMSELF!  And then claimed he didn't and the language was not there.  <br>
<br>

That bill was written back in 2007, and it would form a committee to do a pretty good number of things, a couple of which are to <strong class="text-strong">study</strong> whether mandatory public service is even feasible and what its effects would be.  There is nothing in there that comes close to making it a reality.  Remember it's a committee's job to evaluate ideas and weed out the bad ones.  It also talks about setting up service learning programs in public schools that can't amount to more than yet more wasted time in class.  Useful?  Maybe not.  Revolution-worthy? definitely not.  Please get real and not blow it out to absurd FUD proportions.<br>
<br>
Look at the text of the bill for yourself.  See pages 43 and 283-285.   <a href="http://www.rules.house.gov/111/LegText/111_hr1388_txt.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.rules.house.gov/111/LegText/ ... 88_txt.pdf</a><br>

In my opinion, the committee is most likely to find such a program too expansive and expensive for whatever benefit it might provide, especially when the whole "mandatory service program" is only a couple line items for study on an already ambitious agenda.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>(6) Whether a workable, fair, and reasonable <strong class="text-strong">mandatory service requirement</strong> for all able young people could be developed, and how such a requirement could be implemented in a manner that would strengthen the social fabric of the Nation and overcome civic challenges by bringing together people from diverse economic, ethnic, and educational backgrounds.</div></blockquote>

Here is the section of our 13th amendment that this goes completely against.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Thirteenth Amendment;<br>
<br>
Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Mandatory service = involuntary servitude my friends</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So, you are going to create a following? A cult if you will. You're going to have to get as many followers as you can to take over congress with your beliefs. You are going to be president. And somehow you are going to do this within the next four years?<br>
<br>
You're just complaining to complain. You can't do jack shit about it even if they do work for the people. We may be in deep shit, but you aren't doing anything to change the situation.

You can try to call Obama, but I doubt he'll pick up for you since you're running in 2012. <br>

Ok, so did your Senator vote in your favor? Do you write to him for every bill? If he didn't vote in your favor, did you vote for him the following year? <br>
<br>
Because bitching over and over on an internet forum isn't changing anything. <br>

US can goto any country.<br>

The areas with the High legal gun rates don't have to lock doors<br>
The cities with 'no gun laws'  you better not walk down that street.<br>
Not everyone is feeling the economical crysis in the US.  Just any area with Crappie housing.<br>

Anyone can go to an Hospital in the US and get treatment for free.  No one can be turned away from a ER until after treatment for free<br>

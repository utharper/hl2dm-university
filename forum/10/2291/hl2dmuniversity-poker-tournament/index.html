	<div class="content">Was wondering if there were enough people around here to do a private tournament on Full-Tilt poker. Depending on where you live you only have to be 18 or maybe younger, but if you just got your parents to put it on there credit card it would still work, i was playing long before i was 18 lol... <br>
<br>
But the min deposit is $50 and then min withdraw is $100 and you can ask for a check for withdraw. But im going to see if it would be possible to make the deposit minimum smaller for the people who want to play in this tourney and aren't that serious. <br>
<br>
once i stopped playing for "living" ive been using the same $20 i left off with for the past year and a half doing drunken games every once and a while so it possible to just have fun and not loose your money.<br>
<br>
its also good just to read a book or 2 to learn basic strategy and mathematics behind it, then ur already a better player than 1/2 the ppl out there<br>
<br>
it could be a $5 $10 w.e.....<br>
<br>
i think it would just be fun.<br>
<br>
let me know</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yep reading your opponent is the best part of poker online poker takes that away and u will have to rely on how strong your hand it and try and underplay it with the ammount u put in put. But face to face u can pull off bluffs and acting out where it gets more interesting.<br>

	<div class="content">A discussion about what's better isn't needed imo, because Online-Poker is just more about luck than live-poker ! But anyway in a long Online Poker Tournament you can find out a lot of information about the other players too. If you play a online-tournament with 1000 participators, the best 10 will sit on the final table.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">escuse me cause im pretty drunk<br>
<br>
but this thread isnt about u newbs bitching about live play so stfu<br>
<br>
<br>
obv live play is better than online, but all u guys have said is that omg u cant have tells. Tells are handy but you are the least of your concerns... poker is a game of math.. and thats a bout it.. id doesnt give a fiying fuckign donkey fuck if u got a read on someone if the math says to do it then u do it<br>
<br>
<br>
so one again stop flamming aoubt online and only participate if u actually want to play in this tourney<br>
<br>
<br>
and with the its only luck thing w.e omg <br>
<br>
it only seems like omg only bs lucky hsit happens online becuase your playing 50X as many hands online than if you were playing live becuase with that many more hands being play there are obv going to be more suck outs, and the usck outs are the things ur remeber. u dont remeber the hands u won<br>
<br>
u remeber the hands u got sucked out on<br>
<br>
and yes<br>
<br>
online takes just as much skill if not more than live<br>
<br>
its still mathmatic<br>
<br>
not like that shits rigged<br>
<br>
read a book<br>
<br>
gg<br>
<br>
please say<br>
<br>
"IM IN" <br>
<br>
ifu will paly<br>
<br>
kthx</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

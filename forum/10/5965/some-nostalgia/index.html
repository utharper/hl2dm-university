#2  you have small man syndrome<br>

"A true man says what he mean and means what he says" ~ Thaddeus Hughes.<br>
What matters for a man - when he actually heads out into the world and sees for what it is - would be what that man can do vs. what he cannot. <br>
You have not even shook off the stewing phlegm your mother coated you with when you entered this world, much less moved, shook, and acted in said world and earn the right to call yourself a man. <br>
Disregarding that tidbit for a moment, what you can do in this thread is bitch about creative works done by other men, and what you cannot do is back that cynical-attitude up with some of your own work. <br>
<br>
Hence, you can't do shit son - including troll. <br>
<br>
Overcoming life's obstacles (such as losing one's roof, sleeping in a jetta, leaving moonroof open, and having a homeless person try to enter said moonroof and kill/rob you) and the actions to take in doing so define who you are. <br>
<br>
So far you have sat in your parent's house masturbating and bitching on dead video game forums about video editing when you have not completed a whole video work yourself. <br>
Good stuff. Clearly.<br>
<br>
As silly Big Cheese would say "put up or shut up." <br>

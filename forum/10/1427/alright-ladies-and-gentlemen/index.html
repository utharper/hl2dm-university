	<div class="content">It might seem as though I have an anger problem and just BLOW up and say horrible EVIL insulting things. And you are correct. I appologize, no disrespect TO ANYONE really was intended. I never said I was the SHIT at this game. IN anything you do there will always be SOMEONE out there better than you. Half-Life is no exception. The Original POST tha I made about "Where do you guys play? so I can kill you?" OBVIOUSLY some of you took that to mean I thought I was god at this game. Meh. Not really. I"m better than some. And ZMAN you still arnt shit to me as far as I'm concerned. You go ahead and play your little game if it makes you feel better about who you are. I don't play to COMPETE. I play to have fun. I could care less about score or KD RATIO or anything else. That is all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Well.. no doesn't sound like Z, true.. BUT.. Inferno/Sean seemed to have a bug up his ass.. especially after he play draft the other night, went off about "these people" (paradox, sunsnail and impala played him) with no lives and so on, they made me so mad and they think they are better than everyone. This made ME mad, I have been spending a lot of time with most of you guys to know you are REAL people and you have lives and you are who you are because you work at it, and some may even think of me as a friend by now.<br>
<br>
He comes into MF server and doesn't say much of anything but every so often a smart ass remark, zeros on one player and is like a the dog that bites your leg and doesn't let go, makes it uncomfortable for the players there and most of you know how whiney my FUN MF'ers can get (and by whiney I mean I love you guys)<br>
<br>
Sooooo, we got into words one day and I gave him a "breathe" ban (1 hr) I was in a pissy mood that day for a change and he got in my argument with someone else and ended up being the one getting banned lol.. I left which is equivalent to baning myself to "breathe". So that day I saw Z online and told him, I need you to spank him, he needs to see what a good competitive players is like maybe it will bring him a notch down and get his ego in order. Z said NOOO, I would NEVER do THAT, I am just to nice to do stuff like that to the innocent... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"> <br>
but he submited to my will like in .0002 seconds, and so he did what he said and what Sean said basically.<br>
<br>
So Sean comes in today and basically said "who unleashed Zman on my ass", and I readily admit it and we have been talking since. He is not a bad guy, just has serious grumpy issues and I feel personally that really comes across in his style of gaming, I don't know about you guys but I can always tell when someone is pissed and playing. there is a huge difference, at least for me, playing the competitive guys and having your ass kicked than playing some angry person who is just trying to ruin your game/day/life.<br>
<br>
I think that it was all a good experience for him, maybe for all of us.. somethings that are happening in YOUR life come across in your game, your posts, every where YOU ARE, brings back the issue of is this real life or is the internet a place to do whatever. Well, if you want to be an ass on the internet well, be that, just deal with what you unleash by doing so. Sean is trying to be sarcastic on his posts and it doesn't come out across that well, as we all know the internet looses it humor sometimes. <br>
<br>
Brings me back to my very fist post, introducing myself and saying ".. and OMG I am Girl" was meant to be funny but I was called an attention whore and so on, I dealt but if I hadn't I would have never come back to the U and would think you are mostly a bunch of assholes. We have to pay more attention to how we respond, if you are having a bad day don't take it out on others, life is hard enough without the added stress of internet bullshit.<br>

Leave what? The match between me and Zman or the DRAFT night? Zmans match I left because I got the point. He was in there to try and bully me and show me that I wasnt the best, wich I never claimed, and that there are better people out there and I don't need to go around thinking I'm the shit, wich I don't. DRAFT Night I was just checking out what that whole business was all about. The reaons I left that was because I was getting pissed off at the game. I'm not going to continue a game that pisses me off. I don't now about YOU but I don't sit down in front of the TV and hope I watch something that makes me want to shoot my wife in the face. I did Appologize for some of my words but I never said I wouldnt do it again. I never said I'm going to change my life and who I am because some people in here take me the wrong way.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Indeed. Anyway if I never had any fun playing I would never play. The draft night obviously was not fun for me at the time. I didnt know the map, no one was talking on my team and I kept getting shot in the face and dieing instantly around every corner. So yeah it kinda left a bad taste in my mouth after that and it spread into the forums.Truth is I have a lot of fun playing this game and its one of my favorites.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Impala...I can understand his frustration about leaving games because I do it, and I know others who do it too. Sometimes I have to say fuck it and walk away so I don't end up breaking my mouse/monitor/computer. Sometimes it just sucks having your ass handed to you and you can't take it. Especially if you don't know the map etc....I'm trying to change my whole outlook because a good friend of mine from GoTg said something like, "yeah I'm not the best player and I get my ass handed to me everytime, but I love playing you guys because you're fun" He's one of the few that still like me after leaving and doesn't see an attitude change in me (even though I have my attitude has gotten shitty in game fast). And since he told me this I've tried live by that.<br>
<br>
Also at the extreme end, I have to say this. .Conflict is probably the absolute NICEST person to play in game. He can beat me and Morph in a 2 v 1, never brags, never plays mad, always keeps an upbeat attitude and always helps. If not for him and WT I probably wouldn't want to help out the U as much as I do.

I found it comical that he went so far as to add "*scratches belly*" to really complete the idea, it gives you a great picture to go with the words.  It really reminded me of a buddy I used to spend a lot of time with which is really the only reason it struck a chord with me, I'm not trying to say anything abou this post.

Sean, you have slammed at least 2 well known and loved members of this forum.  One was trying to help you, and the other was just making an innocent comment.<br>
<br>
Here is some advice.<br>
YOU really need to lighten up and stop going out of  you way to insult and flame people that have been members here for a long time.  Its really not going to make you many friends or gain you any respect amongst this community.  We are a pretty open bunch, and accept just about anyone in our midst.  A few of us enjoy some healthy debate, but we will take care of our own.  It is up to you to show that you can co-exist here, not the other way around.<br>

Quite frankly I don't give a fuck about you period or what you say to me. the truth is I've been doing JUST fine  the last 8 years playing this game without this website.

and HUMMM.. OKAY... I am not sure Sean is getting his sarcasm across his posts, they read as personal attacks all the way.<br>
This is what is, Sean has been trying to show me what he enjoys in the game and that is basically killing a lot of people in a short amount of time, spends a lot of time in the SoCal servers. I personally do not have the patience for this kind of play but if that is what he likes then MORE FOR YOU!!! Just realize that we are all different and we like different things, I rather get one good kill on LUKE (all I got in our scrim I think, one kill lol) than killing one thousand noobs and being #1 in a random pub. Just let it go Sean, you started real nice with your apology but had to have one last bite at Z, for all is worth you really want to be mad, be mad at ME, you said you wanted to join MFX and spoke to O-Dog. I wanted to make sure you had what not takes not only skills but as a person, as you can see by the posts it gets tiring to some people to get you ass handed to you over and over again. That is why I took you to draft night and then is why I send Z to spank ya a little. Obviously competing is not for you, these people are good people Sean, they have their lives and THEIR stories, they have been wonderful to me helping me and MFX get off the ground and on its way to next cal season. Take the good, ignore the bad, and yummmmm.. NACHOS!!<br>

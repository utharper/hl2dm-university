	<div class="content">Just so you guys know, I have got like 25-30 people to come on over to HL2DM from a Source MOD by Kuma Games called Shootout, now known as Kuma War Vietnam/WW2. So far, most, have loved it. I am hoping to get more to come in the near future. If you want to check them out, add me to your friends list. I am Sandman with the 300 picture of Leonidas with his sword drawn. There is another Sandman with Leonidas pic but mine has his sword drawn. I am trying to do my part for the community. You can help by posting on my old Shootout clan site and encouraging others to come. Thanks and hope to see you in game!<br>

<a href="http://www.prysmax.com" class="postlink">http://www.prysmax.com</a> =&gt; it's a very popular gaming community and since HL2DM is legally free, a lot of CSS/DoDS and many other games players tried the game. Plus Onty always helps them with advanced techniques and explaining them some stuff.<br>
<br>
In fact, there are also some argentinian teams playing CAL (dunno if 2v2 or 4v4), they are actually DoDS players who saw our clan video and since the game is free, they dled it and joined CAL <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I don't think you even need an ATI and NVIDIA graphics card to get the game. There is a proggy called 3D Analyze that can fool Steam into thinking you have a Nvidia graphics card through emulation from what i have read on some of the forums. <br>

	<div class="content">In fact, since that ATi promotion (it was previous than nVidia) we have been "fooling" Steam in PrysmaX.com, plus 90% of users have CSS/DoDS cracked with PacSteam or those illegal versions.<br>
<br>
Most of users use nVidia in South America, their mid-end models are better in balance to price/perfomance (or used to be). So that's the reason why everybody used to trick Steam with that tool before the nVidia promo, lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

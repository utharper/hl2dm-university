	<div class="content">CARMAGEDDON NEXT GEN: sounds cool heh? well EIDOS killed it. For those who never played 'geddon, it was pretty sick.there was a next gen version planned and eidos decided not to do it.<br>
<br>
POSTAL 3: It's Alpha, no first person footage so far, and since it's coming out for 360 and PS3, expect it to be way more politicly correct (GTA without cars? sounds dull)<br>
<br>
Fallout 3: Now i know fallout wasn't sick, but if you wanted, you coulddo some pretty wicked shit ( getting kids hooked on drugs so they folow you around then sell them to a slavery) but Fallout 3 looks pretty damn amazing so far. If there's any fan out there, this one looks good. But still, since it's on console, prolly won't be as intense and crazy than the good ol PC fallout 2.<br>
<br>

DUKE NUKEM FOREVER changes of developpers; 3DREALM just couldn't get their shit together so the project has passed over to this company:<br>

<br>
Looks like a Viking, lol.<br>
<br>
First marines:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img.hl2spain.com/img/articulos/origenes_hl/dance_troupe.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
This one looks like the heavy guy from TFC:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img.hl2spain.com/img/articulos/origenes_hl/chaingun_grunt.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Removed Scientist:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img.hl2spain.com/img/articulos/origenes_hl/sci_lab_early.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Probably the first idea about the Combines (looks like Hunters or those removed Robot Combine Soldiers)<br>
<br>

Removed Alien:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://img.hl2spain.com/img/articulos/origenes_hl/diablo1.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
HL2 Removed weapons:<br>
<br>
Iceaxe (melee weapon)<br>
<img src="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/2591/iceaxe16ss.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Flaregun (already ported and used in TF2)<br>
<img src="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/3318/flaregun16rn.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Binoculars (unnecessary, HEV suit has its own zoom)<br>
<img src="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/1219/binoculars17vp.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
HK5 (replaced with SMG1)<br>
<img src="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/9867/smg213bu.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
AK-47 (ported to CSS Beta)<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/7393/ar127mq.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
AR1 ("overpowered", replaced by the later AR2) You may try it at HL2CTF.<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/7981/ar219if.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Heavy Machinegun (excesive use of ammo and very powerful against any enemy)<br>
<img src="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/6799/hmg15sh.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Irifle (kind of flaregun, they used this model to make the AR2)<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/3108/irifle4sq.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Sniper Rifle (some Combine Soldiers use it, but it has been removed for our use) You may try it at HL2CTF.<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/4294/sniper15ac.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Molotov Cocktail (the enemies AI wasn't that advance at that time, you could easily eliminate any with these)<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/3299/molotov15re.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Hopwire (overpowered) A must-try with Ep1, set sv_cheats 1 and give weapon_hopwire. Amazing.<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/2103/hopwire19sv.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Cremator's Head (you can see one of these inside of a jar at Eli's lab, if you press E he will tell you that Alyx picked it up from the streets and brought it)<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/2103/hopwire19sv.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
The Cremator was an enemy designed by the Combine to clean streets, they were removed because they made instant-kills.<br>
Headcrab (similar to snarks of HL1)<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/104/launch1of.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Guard Gun (primary weapon of the removed Combine Guards)<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/8543/guardgun5en.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
TauCanon or GaussGun (hooked to the buggie)<br>
<img src="http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/9861/gauss19zr.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Fire extinguisher (not a gun exactly, it was used in the "Borealis" chapter to extinguish some fires and keep on moving, maybe we'll see about this in Ep3)<br>
<img src="http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/1352/extintor2ms.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
Thumper (a portable and smaller hammer useful for antlions)<br>
Immolator (Cremator's weapon, it does make the same damage as a Combine Crazy Ball of the AR2 but you shoot it like a laser)<br>
Sticky Launcher (actual secondary weapon of TF2's Demoman)<br>
Physgun (similar to Sourceforts' GravGun)<br>
<img src="http://img283.imageshack.us/img283/3141/physgunthumb7ou.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Well, and plenty of HL2 characters and enemies were removed. Valve planned to make a chapter of a factory were the Combines had childrens working for them, but they were removed because nobody allows children to be killed in videogames.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I loved carmageddon its based off a late 1970's film called "deathrace 2000" starring sly stalone if you played the game the plot of film is almost identical.<br>

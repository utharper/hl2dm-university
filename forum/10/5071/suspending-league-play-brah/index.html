	<div class="content">I no longer have the time to be an admin, brah. I stepped up taking 12 credits to 16, and started working 10 hours a week to about 20. Furthermore there are several devastating exploits crippling the competitive play that NEED to be addressed before we start league again.<br>
<br>
1. DDOS attacks, they've been targeting two to three specific players, scrims are unplayable with them atm. Solutions are there and will be provided to our new admins.<br>
<br>
2. Spectate Glitch, an old source hack/exploit that FINALLY trickled down to hl2dm, it was widely used in CSS until all leagues mandated zblock which correctly authenticates correct steamID's. Zblock will block any efforts to use this exploit that manipulates steamID's by hiding them from a server registering the steamID's.<br>
<br>
3. Without going into alot of detail there has arisen a new exploit that allows objects to pass through a body, including orbs.<br>
<br>
I will be suspending league play from American CU altogether and stepping down to make way for a person who CONVENIANTLY thank god the same time I PM'ed people about stepping down is seeking to create a centralized website/forum for both league and forums. More detail to come if this person is willing to divulge it. He may post here and feel free to share this info if he wants. This means CU as it stands is no longer our league.<br>
<br>
Parting words as admin; thank you for season 1 everyone, I had blast (not just saying that because we went undefeated in 3v3 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">, though it did help). The most important parting words are that any competitive league servers implement zblock immediately, it will be able to effectively block the spectate bug, and enforce rates in a manner that blocks this new object glitch.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah it was a bit expected tbh. Season 1 was probably the peak of play in a very long time, in div1 at least, we all felt pretty worn out after that season. There wouldve been enough teams as I had 2 more comittals in 3v3, and 4 more in 2v2. This was more or less about me no longer having the time, plus as it turns out someone is creating a centralized place for us, so it just sweetened the deal for me not to find a replacement CU admin and rather just prepare for a move elsewhere.<br>

About Zblock, it does limit bhop on CSS, but it can be tailored to allow bhop in HL2DM. Er, blas already on it :S</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm gonna step down completely. I've asked the person to replace me and he accepted, though not sure why he hasnt already posted here, maybe still needs privacy yet.  It's just not a good time to start anyway, the two new huge exploits need to be addressed and league servers need to load Zblock, 100% no compromise.

I've never heard of the spec exploit either until recently. I really don't want to get into specifics so this isnt  found out/manipulated by current players or European players who may not use Zblock in CU. The second exploit isnt just a "normal" exploit, this involves having say, 3 orbs directly shot at you and they will just pass through the body.<br>
<br>
@keefy I dont know whether CU will use zblock, its up to them and doesnt seem to be the biggest of priorities since I dont believe any European players have found out these two exploits yet.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I got like 5 things to respond to/correct. First is that there will be a new comprehensive website that is league and forums, which is the point of the website so we will no longer use CU. Holy will be coordinating with a number of people on it. <br>
<br>
@creature, I have no idea what you're talking about? The CU config was modified for Americans to be the exact standards $W, emO and synergy use as their standard competitive server settings in the first place, I have no idea what you're talking about and never received complaints like that ever. Unless you just failed to mention to me that happened to you while you played.<br>
<br>
The thing to correct is I got it wrong on this exploit, it doesnt allow orbs to pass through the body, it allows you to shoot orbs and make them uncatchable, as in you can have someone 5 ft away, shoot an orb with your GGun primed and no matter what you do you cant catch an orb/object. It's an exploit combined with a minor hack. Either way it can be denied through Zblock. There should be absolutely no question Zblock needs to be implemented because of this along with the new spec exploit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You're the idiot that admitted to about 15 different people, and rate cycling is not specifically prohibited by CU nor CAL when it did run. We already have proof of what you did, and you admitting you use a mani hack. You forced us to run around making sure Zblock plus another few programs are installed in matchplay servers from now, alot of effort for one sad wannabe hacker.

I thought it was proven that since they had cl_interp set to something else it spammed cl_cmdrate 100. And you just admitted to actually cycling rates (as does Shuz/Shonty/Seanigle etc, but that's a different thing altogether).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Overgeneralize much? BTW when's the last time you even played in a league, and secondly even had the skill to compete top tier? Maybe you'd give a fuck when we're talking about the difference between cycling between 70 inputs, which is at least managable from the opponents perspective, to Zeik's explosive level of cycling 1-100 inputs and using a mani mod on top of it to make it worse. Oh and BTW, every single clan in CU had a player who cycled rates, even some of the more idolized clans you would never think would, I'll just leave it at that. Cycling was technically legal and I would've had to ban half the community.<br>
<br>
There might, oh might be a line in all types of sports where you say, nope, that's gone too far. Zeik clearly went too far, and if you think having the ability to throw objects, and orbs without being to catch them period is not such a big deal, you're far more passive then I thought you were. Lastly, you're right, I didn't need a poll, some of last few actions as an admin were to temp ban Zeik and strongly suggest to Holy that all servers now implement Zblock no poll needed. People do still care, brah. There are some people who dont give a fuck if 1,000,000 people watch us win something, we do it because we love the game, brah.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No I don't have the skill to compete top tier leagues and I don't see how it has anything to do with this.<br>

I'm just saying league play is the only moment everyone can face pretty much whoever's left in hl2 in TDM and it sucks to see it get on hold until an exploited known by apparently 2 or 3 individuals. Some of them schedules around league play time and it's just good times in general to have these games going, even if it's game breaking, the league has started, maybe the said exploit has been used to win matches, meaning the current ladder is possibly already different from what it shouldve been.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree with con and cellar, I have been playing games for many years. What I have learned is every game has exploits. Exploits are better open then closed then you have more people trying to solve them as well as exploit them which increases the speed at which things evolve. Look at the impulse 51 exploit by trying to keep it under wraps we ended up with a plugin to fix it rather then if we had opened it up and had more people looking into it and it took much longer for the solutions to propagate. Finally after a long time we figure out all you need to do is change a server command but because we were too near sited and some people had personal conflicts of interest we end up wasting all this time developing a plugin and trying to distribute it and overall end up making servers less consistent and secure. <br>
<br>
Also there are all sorts of funny exploits like rate cycling but in the end its the least of our worries if someone really wants to they can go download an aimbot which is many times more effective than scripts or any other exploit. In fact it is almost sad that people are trying this junk if you are going to abuse the game and break league rules then you are cheating and if you are cheating you might as well go all the way. If it is more open we can all know about it and look for the signs and more people may have a chance to develop more solutions which will allow the best solutions to come forward faster. <br>
<br>
Also something that stops every exploit is rediculous nothing does there is always another way around it. It's just a lame false sense of security bad server ops like to claim to keep noobs playing. <br>
<br>
At the end of the day exploits always exist in ever game and 90% of the players are not using them and are fair to play with. I am 99.99% sure every season of every league in HL2DM has had at least one person aimbotting or wall hacking but overall it did not stop the majority of people from competing and having fun. You keep running the league and develop the security on the side when the security works implement it. But in the meantime we get to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i think you're either wrong, or speaking geek.  i have no idea wtf your "cycling" inputs means to you.  but i know i dont CYCLE rates.  i have them set in my auto exec and thats where they stay.  i get whatever max rates the server im playing on allows.  i wouldn't have any idea why or when i should ever change them unless i'm on a server that starts showing choke and loss.  then i would have to spend some time experimenting with rates until i could improve choke and loss.  and thats why i was all pissy in CU when lttl fucked with their server rates.  because i had no idea how to change client rates for myself or my team mates to improve our net code before the match started.  i certainly have no fucking idea how differing cmd, update, interp rates affect various weapons.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">These are my concerns, I'm posting them here incase anyones interested, if not, skip over this post.</span><br>
</strong><br>
<br>
Its not false-positives that it reports per-say. It just reports any changes in netcode settings including cl_interp, cl_interp_ratio, cl_updaterate, cl_cmdrate, and a few more I believe. The only time you can say someone is rate cycling is when the log actually reports that cl_cmdrate went down then back up.<br>
<br>
Now, I do have some concerns about this whole shenanigans Valiums. When you brought it up to me, you said "Hey are you alright with suspending things in CU for a while. Holy is coming out with a new site that might merge a league and forums together." I said yes only because I wanted more time to get the 1v1 Division ready and hopefully get some new blood in DM as well. <br>
<br>
Now talking with Holy, it appears I'm not even going to be the 1v1 admin anymore, which if that's to be so be it. My problem with this however is the fact that every time we try to run a league ourselves it has failed because people blame bad management. Now with CU we did have our first successful season in a long time, I think this is partially because we did have other people that managed it with us at the same time.<br>
<br>
Another thing I don't like is the current set of Admins I was told there would be. In all three admins, Holy being head admin. No problems with holy at all really, but I don't like the idea of a "Head Admin" persay. I'd much rather an odd number to form a board of admins that vote / delegate on topics.<br>
<br>
Also the board of admins should probably be voted on and also re-elected every 2 season. They should also most likely be a mix of all clans that will be participating or at least "well known-trusted" community members.<br>
<br>
These are my concerns, I'm posting them here incase anyones interested, if not, skip over this post.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@ Edge, I hear your concerns, loud and clear, I've been recently asked to become an admin, I will likely accept and address these concerns soon Edge.<br>

@Confused, some exploits like rate cycling, prop jumping are gonna be in general like banging a head against a wall to address, but have you tried out this new exploit? Do you know what its like to have objects and orbs thrown at that are absolutely uncatchable? I dont think you do and if you did see this exploit it would become clear it needs addressing or why even play at all if someone can have that advantage. Do some of you really think its A-OK to play in league against someone who has this type of advantage that can fixed, why oh why?<br>

	<div class="content">i dont understand...<br>
the north american part of league hl2dm was dead, there werent any active leagues around as far as i remember...<br>
we started the american part in cu, offering BOTH website to enter wars AND forum (which was hardly used by americans except for the war arrangement), and the american part of cu played a successful first season in 2v2 and 3v3... you guys even could make any rule you wanted. noone stopped you from making zblock mandatory.<br>
then it was pause, 2 mysterious exploits appeared, and then u closed american cu to start a new league to have BOTH forum and website? Oo<br>
<br>
does anyone thinks that with another new league everyone will move from the U to the new league forum?<br>
<br>
its not my business anymore, but i dont see the benefit to start a new league instead of staying in a league that is now going into 15th season for 3v3 (and is the most successful hl2dm league with this amount of seasons), and having a well experienced and mostly fair management... but<br>

To answer your question more directly, there is nothing you can do. You set your rates to vary from 1-100, and use a script that only Zeik and Blur posess. Blur pretended to be Zeik's friend, got the script and consequentially demonstrated the script + rating for us and allowed its demonstration to have a programmer setup a server mod defense for it. You essentially turn yourself into a non-solid object by the rating + script, watch the demo is all I can say.

Another person commenting on the state of leagues who never really played in them. If you did play in them you know skill can counter exploit and EVEN hacks. Take for instance Divinity and myself, neither of us have ever tried any exploit, nor used a hack in our life and yet we're both top players who have taken down "exploiters" or known hackers. Although I do agree this community has seemed to develop a exploit sympathy over time. I mean people are really stating its just OK to have this new exploit where you cant catch anything they throw at them, really? How far down have we gone?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Id say if youre using mag vs shotgun at near point blank range, you should generally expect to die.<br>

As for speedcrawl, this is just another reason why advanced techniques should not be kept secret.

	<div class="content">@Val, indeed I have seen this orb exploit, never used it but had it used against me for "testing" by someone you probably already know the name of. I totally understand that this exploit in particular is a no-no in league play, but that's not what I meant in my previous post. What I meant is that if you think you're going to find every little exploit people use before the league season starts, then I'm sad to say it will probably never start at all. Yes the big exploits that we know of like rate cycling and the "uncatchable orb" have to be banned and dealt with in league play, but there will ALWAYS be new minor and/or major exploits that come in, and we can't always completely stop league play to find out if any others are used.<br>
<br>
@Ko-tao, well for the mag vs shotgun topic, imo I've been getting a lot better with my mag lately, and realised that using the mag isn't a disadvantage even at a certain close range against a shotgun, unless it's really really close and you know you'll die in 1 blast, but other than that, 2 shots of the mag will usually kill the guy, and usually 2 shots of shotgun (depending on range of course) will kill the guy also. But that's just imo, not saying that's how it always goes or that the mag is better than shotty or w.e.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The ironic thing that Fearsome was demanding about not suspending to fix things (besides he himself suspended league play many times) is that the DOS attacks were making it so many of us couldn't play period. <br>
<br>
All the aside the new mod we have addresses all four exploits. DOS attacks are deflected, ghost exploit is restricted, any user who rate cycles will be immediately kicked/banned from the server. Any nefarious/unusual scripts such as the script Zeik used to aid him are detected even before the player enters the server and is globally banned from any servers using the mod.<br>

@Rico Absolutely, we should simply go on HL2DM:OB and run a league on it, the more people plays on it the better, beside, there USED to be a good reason not to move because you could find random pubs on decent maps when no one was online. Now its all lowgrav RP, really, all of them now.<br>

As far as the last league being interrupted, I just think some times, when you're too close to a problem you don't see the whole picture, and I guess with a step back the ones in charge figured that people would probably want to play no matter what.

	<div class="content">I didn't really want to get brought into this but when if first saw the exploit zeik had, i knew it was not a normal script. Infact I contacted my gsp to see exactly what he was doing and they came to the conclusion he was using some sort of client side plugin. These scripts he had were running along with a client side plugin to overide server commands and basically giving the user the ability to do anything he wants. It is completely VAC proof and no ways of detection really. A large ammount of the scripts don't show up in FTP log files. Like I thought from the beginning there was no way zeik coded all of this scripts he had himself. I got the scripts and the client side plugin from zeik and immediately went to holymoly, valiums, blast ect. We started off by finding various plugins that are supposed to block these commands. These scripts can completely override any server commands and allow you to potentially crash individual players, enable wait command (for your self) and even enable sv_cheats (for your self). There are no limits to what they can do. The scripts have been used for years in games like css and now i guess people in hl2dm have them. Lucky for us there are a few plugins out there that can completely stop the use of these client side plugins and malicious scripts. When we find the right one to use for the league, we will share it with the community so they too can protect their servers. I am not going to put all this up for download for obvious reasons. As of now none of the servers in dm are completely protected from this exploit.<br>

Everyone knows about the exploits now. I gave you every single bit of knowledge I have of them, and blas gave you a demo of it in action. What more do you want? You want me to give a link where everyone can download the script?

Well, we kinda had to stop because we're transition from CU to the new site. Also we kinda had to stop because Xs kinda couldnt play any games because their servers were kinda being crashed everyday by someone targeting bluR. You may notice you cant play matches when you dont have a server that isnt running.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes but RPG is not victim to hitreg issues, this can cause balance problems, and i am yet to go into a server and get good enough rego..on complete noobs even to say that the balance between explosives and bullets is even. Obviously the noobs dont win but they often get a few more kills then they should as a result. In the situations BI describes the other is generally at an advantage as a result, and shotgun having a spread means that atleast half+ of the damage will generally register.

We are going to have lightweight plugins to block these scripts and dos attacks in the new league.<br>
<br>
Like i said b4 all these scripts and clientside plugins work fine in hl2dm:ob, css, tf2, dod, l4d. As valiums previously stated we aren't trying to address all the small exploits that exist in hl2dm. We found new exploits that no one knew about and we are trying to eliminate them in the new league. They are to big to just be left alone or ignored. Whats wrong with going to a new league, the people that made cu WORLD WIDE happen are backing up eFPS just as much. As i said in a previous post when the league starts we will have plugins out that will completely block dos attacks, and stop illegal scripting. Changing to hl2dm:ob won't change anything or stop this exploit. What surprises me the most is the people who are against the new league have not even played in cu since it was launched yet are quick to criticize our positive attempts to make hl2dm better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If someone can do this it means they are out right cheating no different then using a wall hack. So what? Like I said I am 99.99% sure in every season of every league at least 1 person was aimbotting and using a wall hack. The fact is you cannot expect any plugin or anticheat to be 100% effective against these things if you think one will be it just shows you have no idea what you are talking about. You have to play through it, part of it means watching closer and trying to catch people manually and part of it just means growing up and realizing that if someone beats you on an internet game it is not the end of the world. If you think you got a guy then alert the admins or try to bust him your self. But if we don't even know who all might be doing it we are in no different of a situation then we have always been in. <br>
<br>
Here is my problem with this whole situation. It takes years to develop a decent league website. It takes even longer to implement effective anticheat. In fact no one has ever made an anticheat that was not pretty quickly dispatched of by cheat coders. If someone wants to do either of these items knock yourself out. But in the mean time keep running the league that is already working. No offense to Holy but I am completely unaware of his web programming ability and have no knowledge of him ever being a league admin. And he is some how suppose to quickly put something together that is better than CU or CAL which had years and many seasons and multiple games worth of experience and time to develop what they had? Either he has some qualifications that I am unaware of or he just has no idea what it will take to do that, or he is going to deliver a product that is sub par. No matter what way you do the math things just do not add up. The other problem is that if such people with the skills and more importantly time are working on such a website maybe they should use their talents to help make CU a better back end rather than reinventing the wheel.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Once again people are putting words in our mouths and assuming we are looking to obtain this naturally overinflated goal. We know we can't, no one ever can. We are patching up an issue and loophole that is older in nature and well known in the CSS communities. This scripting loophole allows a 4th grader to implement wallhacks, or manually edit a server config, or your config.<br>
<br>
Zeik had these powers and openly admitted he along with another person wanted to use these new abilities in league play. There is absolutely no question whatsoever this loophole needed to be closed, and it has. If we didnt, this loophole discovered by Zeik would likely spread like a plague where would we have a massive influx of server editing, rate exploits unlike anything you've ever seen, object exploiting ect ect ect.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yea, i dont mean that though, i mean lets say, shooting someone in the face at close range and getting absolutly no reg. etc<br>
The shotgun is odd, i find on some servers if they are moving/strafing, then shooting them with secfire can be very uneffective. Like on servers that have hitsounds for example, u can shoot someone and gets lots of blood but get get no reg at all on that shot. And it seems to be on secfire mainly, primary fire has more consistancy on hitreg.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well actually if you watch the CU finals that's really what its like (or our archived CAL finals). Mag headshots are expected to be automatic at the very top echelon, and they pretty much were.</div></blockquote>

Xbow and Mag - 1<br>

Xbow and Mag - 0<br>

Ok so you watched one match of the combined CU and CAL finals, and it was a 1v1 demo. Congrats for not making your point.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">some of what is being described in this thread is clearly MORE than what i would define as an exploit.  i agree with fearsome in that regards... that its an outright cheat or hax.  and i would support a ban on zeek for league play due to his use of said cheat/hax.  doesn't matter to me if he was pubbing or scrimming.  if he used it anywhere other than in a controlled server with knowing consent of all others in the server... ban.  after all, im not hearing any remorse out of zeek at all.  no  mention of a noble experiment for the benefit of the community.  just big fat rationalizations and childish boasting.<br>
<br>
therefore, ive never disagreed with the idea of plugins to prevent this cheat.  but i think its a bit of a slippery slope regarding the term "scripts".  basically, thats because ive never made an effort to understand scripts.  to my memory... sv_pure 2 was supposed to eliminate "scripts"... at least those using the "wait" command.  and then there are keyboards and mice that allow macro's.  so... is a script a script without the "wait" command?  is a macro a script?  is the use of any "alias" commands for a bind a script?  in my mind at least, there is knowledge amongst certain clans/players regarding how/when to bind certain rates for enhanced weapon performance.  is that a good script?  bad script?  no script?  exploit?  cheat?  hax?  or just priviledged info for those who happen to be "properly" connect to those in the know? <br>
<br>
i think these things need to be discussed in the open.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It is some sad kid with nothing better to do I guess. Holy's match server are DOS protected as it stands. Just FYI Holy could either help you setup a KAK mod or if he isnt around you can use the latest model of Zblock 4.4, it has a DOSenable_0 command which prevents the attacks. Zblock however does not prevent LUA based scripts tho, which are the more dangerous scripts where KAK is needed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

download this plugin, most people dosing in this game are just using a simple program that sends empty packets to the server.<br>

Before I start to get ready to go out to the club with Ace2Quick I forgot to address Cellar's comments. LUA/LSS designs arent hacks, they are scripts that conceil hacks or unlock server priviledges, but are scripts at the end of the day.<br>
<br>
Other thing is Zeik is banned, there was a brief misunderstanding and has been cleared up. Not only did you go around and brag about your exploits, you bragged how you temporarily convinced Holy to give you some slack room, I think your bragging days are done.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ok, i thought i would start here.  my brother has a 42" plasma tv.  him and his wife were watching tv tonight and they heard a loud pop and smoke started coming out of the top of the tv.  he called me cause he knows i can fix pc's and thought i could fix that.  i told him, 1) i have never heard of that happening to a plasma 2) i doubt that can be fixed 3) if it can it prolly gonna cost half of what it would cost for a new one.  those were my guesses.  does anybody have any advice?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Depends on the model, I own a Zenith plasma and before buying it I did research into potential probs. Apparently LG produced a Y-Sustain board that it has sold to Toshiba &amp; Zenith, and they are known to "pop" and smoke. The board will run about $150 now-a-days with cost of repair. If it's another brand IDK, can always just google his specific brand + loud pop and smoke XD</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
There is a possibility of that happening if the TV was left on for an extended amount of time and the internal parts may have over-heated causing the loud Pop and Smoke. Could they still see the picture they were watching on the TV?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ya Chem, doesn't sound good at all. Try calling any store that sells tvs and asking them if they ever heard of that happening and what it could be. I have a Panasonic Plasma and never had any problems . I did a lot of research when i bought my tv and i was told to buy either Panasonic or Samsung. But now they say to buy a brand that begins with a S ..If he's gonna buy another one that is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Unless you get people who take video games as 'serious business' and take their ball and go home when things don't go their way. such is life.<br>

my hands get tired from hl2dm, it's way more intense, always bunnyhopping, the constant playing defense, offense and skulking around. the game is like smoking crack, an intense high, or drinking ever clear an intense drunk. i am a full blown addict sneaking in games when ever i can. but i can't smoke it all the time.<br>
<br>
l4d is more like a lark, a throw away game that has a less intense demands from concentration and constant assault from enemies. l4d is more like weed, a more mellow buzz, or beer a slower paced buzz that you can take or leave when ever.  it will never replace the style of play that is hl2dm, which i'll play probably until there are no more severs to play on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This. Plus, it's fun as hell if you are playing with 3 other friends. It's pretty close to CSS if you have 1 dickhead in there yelling directions like you are a 4 year old or something.

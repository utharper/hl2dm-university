Yeah one of the things put to a vote was kicking me out, what's new though?  Anyway all bitterness aside my favorite moment was when I picked out Blasphemy Squad out in a HAX server, he didn't know how to bunnyhop but because of his personality and name, I knew one day he would be a great player, nobody believed he would go on to be at first. Anyway, the moment came a year later during a $W scrimmage, he died 7 times in a row, and I was giving up hope in him completely as a player, until after dying the 7th time, he caught two orbs, a barrel, killed everyone in $W in the shower room then went on to kill them all juggling orbs and grates at the same time. As I watched from the sidelines as he tore through $W, I knew it wouldn't be long until Master would become Student.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Cleric had a malware infection break out on his pc during his top 16 match vs tlc (single elim, winner goes to the top8 lan to compete for prizes and 100k, loser gets a free copy of hl2dm lol). Popups from registrycleanerexpress dot com minimized the game several times during the match (someone probably still has the demo, it was heavily circulated at the time), causing cleric extra deaths and running down the clock (cleric was down several frags at this point). Anyway, cleric lost, but had a great fit over the next week or so in which he tried to convince the fios officials to have the match replayed, accusing tlc of hacking his computer and other assorted silliness and generally wrecking his own reputation in the process. In the end the match was not reversed (unsurprisingly), and cleric vanished from the community shortly thereafter.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you are 6 months too late. It has been like that for ages and all great tutorials and cool info of editing ect is entered oblivion and it unlikely to come back. What happened was the site was poorly coded and so other drama and they are to poor and not willing enough to bring it back. But it is a shame ifrod went down they where one of the top producers of frag movies for the gaming community. There might be stuff on utube though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">That sucks <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> . I really liked infected prod, they really helped me out back when I was first starting out with demo files. Do you have any other website recommendations? I searched youtube and didn't find too much, I checked my old hardrive and found I had downloaded a few tuts from infected that people could use if they wanted them. I can upload them, if anybody wants em. Messing with demos is a pure pain in the crack, but infected productions seemed to help out. I found this guy's website that I have used in the past, its okay. <a href="http://xxiamg0dlyxx.ucoz.com/" class="postlink">http://xxiamg0dlyxx.ucoz.com/</a><br>
Any other sites?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

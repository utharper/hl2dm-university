School.  I don't want it to be able to play games.  It's time for srs biznus.  Just be reasonably fast with everyday shit, decent battery life, reliable, and all that bullshit.  <br>
I haven't bought one in a few years.  I'm just wondering what brands are good right now.  Toshiba used to make some nice ones, but things change from year to year with manufacturers.  The top brand last year can easily be shit this year.<br>
<br>
By the way, if I drop the fuck out of a laptop, that motherfucker is easily breaking into 348 pieces.  No doubt.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

$8bills can get you an<br>
Acer 4820tg, core i5 and an ATI 5650.<br>
<br>
5650 &gt; the 330m but the 4820tg is sold out almost everywhere. Those are the best possible laptops you can get for $800 hundo. If you want to go below 8bills your scratching at some super shitty laptops. Don't forget refurbished laptops BTW.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Much recommend!<br>
<br>
I was thinking with DELL you can get a zero interest free platinum account for 12 months. Essentially you could just pay monthly installments of $100 every month then close out the account 7 months in and you never pay a dime on interest. Also if your looking for EXTREME battery life there is the Alienware M11x with C2D CULV processor. Lasts about 5-7 hours and can actually play MW2 at high settings. Only drawback is the tiny screen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's quite a good deal for what you're getting.  Radeon 4250 is a lot better than intel integrated bullshit.  I just bought an HP dv6z (directly from HP), which is damn near the exact same thing as that, except it came with a Radeon 5470 dedicated card on top of the 4250 integrated.  I like it a lot so far, after removing all the bloat I can run TF2 in native res on mostly high with no frame issues, paid a funny amount for my laptop too: $666.03 with coupon/tax.  I bought 2 batteries with my laptop instead of one though so that raised the price higher.<br>
<br>
But yea, I like my HP, the bloat was mind blowing though.  Will it last a long time for me? Fuck if I know I hope so.<br>
<br>
This is also a good deal <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834115821&amp;cm_re=acer_as1551-_-34-115-821-_-Product" class="postlink">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... -_-Product</a><br>
<br>
Comes with a dual core processor instead of usual intel atom single core, and radeon graphics instead of intel integrated.  I read it could run source engine games like css/hl2.  Would've gotten this if I didn't buy an HP.<br>

	<div class="content">Hmmm...a laptop that will break into 348 pieces when dropped?  Sorry, the laptops I have dealt with only break into 231 pieces so I guess they don't qualify!  I purchased a Dell laptop a few years ago from Best Buy, all around a good system except it came with Vista which I can't stand.  I deal exclusively with Dell laptops at my work place and so far they're holding up quite well and are dependable for day to day tasks.  Of course these laptops are a little out of your price range.  But my <span style="text-decoration:underline">point</span> to all of this is that Dell seems to make some very reliable laptops.  That's about all I can recommend as those are the only ones I've dealt with and am quite satisfied with.  Good luck.  Oh yeah, and it doesn't hurt to have a laptop that you can game on. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

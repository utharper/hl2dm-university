I am not an admin. Because me and Holy respect eachother, the reasons for departure will be kept secret.

If you wanna have players sign up, outside of this community, it really needs to be easy to navigate. To me, that has been the biggest problem with pretty much every league site I've ever seen. Having to sign up for the forum seperately just adds insult to injury. As of right now, efps is just another league site. I hope that efps will be "THE" league site when it's all said and done.

It's not difficult for you or me or anyone that has "been there, done that" with leagues, but for those new to joining a league it is. I had to spend a lot of extra time getting guys signed up at cal, warzone, and dont even get me started with the HL2:CTF league site <a href="http://www.mygamingleague.com" class="postlink">http://www.mygamingleague.com</a>. A lot of it had to do with registrations not going through, properly being added to the team, and doing all sorts of other crap that they had a hard time figuring out (there is always something). Noobs, yes they are, but you still have to consider that if I had to walk through 8 of my guys to sign up to pretty much every league site, something needs adjusted. With all that said, the way Holy was talking the site up, I was expecting something more grand. As of now, it looks a lot like warzone. Perhaps my imagination got the best of me. None of this is a knock on you or anyone that worked on the site, it's more to do with league sites in general.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Have the user registered for both and then all he has to do to is to join a <strong class="text-strong">team</strong> with a password. If the <strong class="text-strong">team</strong> is participating therefore he is, if he isn't  in any <strong class="text-strong">team</strong> he won't be placed in any roster. <br>
'' <strong class="text-strong">Team</strong> '' can be created and locked by a single person for 1v1 games such as quake so he can then be placed in a roster.<br>

basically you register for leagues+forums<br>

you aren't placed anywhere until you join a team or create a 1v1 team with only you in it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It still creates a database with a lot of blank spaces and Ive always been told that is a bad thing to do with database tables.  Even though the spaces are empty they still take up storage space because the database has to assign them a value whether there is data in them or not and the database becomes a lot less efficient</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

U said no one in the US played that map, but the league includes not only US players right? There are 50% maps weren't ever played for scrims in EU...<br>
What did i want to say is that they can practise it before the season starts<br>

	<div class="content">Copied from the eFPS Steam Group. WHAT? You're not a part of the Steam Group? That's so square. You should fix that.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">I want to thank everyone for being so patient while we got the site together. I have some really amazing news. In less than a week, the site will fully launch.<br>
<br>
EverythingFPS will be the only all-inclusive gaming portal on the internet. Hosting skins, maps, leagues, and forums for the most popular FPS games on the market, eFPS will be the only site gamers will need to bookmark.<br>
<br>
Over 13 GB of skins and maps will initially be housed on everythingFPS, but this will just be the start. Panels of skin and map experts will judge user submissions to determine whether or not submitted new content should be added to our archives.<br>
<br>
With community-driven leagues, the emphasis is taken off a corporate league model and power is put back in the hands of the players themselves. Our first league may be the one dearest to our hearts - hl2dm sign-ups are already underway. And with ad revenue from the site fueling leauge prize pools, we happily anticipate launching leagues for CSS, L4D, TF2, L4D2, and BC2 in the near future.<br>
<br>
But we wouldn't be here today without the help and support of many members of the FPS gaming community. I'd briefly like to thank Steven "DEFme", Francois "conflict", Sean "Bucky", and Will "Da11as" for making this dream a reality. As we start building steam, things are going to start happening fast and furiously, and we'll use both the site itself and this Steam Group to keep you all udpated.<br>
<br>
Once again, thanks for your support and dedication to this project.<br>

Call it EURO section, CU has nothing to do with eFPS, why r u still talkin about CU?<br>
I cannot understand you all are so emotional about that two letters. I am not a CU agent, but there is no other euro or asia hl2dm forum, where u can invite people to play, and i dont ask u to invite them anyway, so dont talk about cu, i dont wanna make a CU in eFPS, now it's clear: no cu in efps.<br>

speaking about efps i really hope that some euro teams will sign up for it. but i doubt its gonna work out for many teams. i think it will be only a few teams that want to play after midnight and with a ping above 100 when they can have it much easier with playing in cu. this is no offend, i really hope that efps will work and maybe i sign up for the 1v1 ladder <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

	<div class="content">I haven't been completely clear about what I'm thinking in this thread, so let me try to say what's in my head.<br>
<br>
Launching a new league isn't easy. Convincing players that you're going to provide them with something worthwhile can be difficult, especially given the transient nature of most historical hl2dm leagues. Launching eFPS in North America was fairy easy, however. I don't think many North American teams felt "at home" at Clans-United and a lot of people wanted a different league. When Valiums came on board and disbanded the North American CU league, eFPS became the only real option for North American players. So getting North American players on board wasn't nearly as hard as it could have been.<br>
<br>
The story completely changes when it comes to CU for European players, however. Clans-United has been around there for quite some time now. It's a league run by Europeans for Europeans. Their teams are used to the rules and used to how things work. It just works for them. And I respect Clans-United for providing exactly what Europeans need in a hl2dm league. Trying to take away teams from Clans-United would be incredibly difficult at this point. But more importantly - I think it would be wrong. It would be bad for the European community, bad for hl2dm relations between CU and eFPS, and just bad for everyone. Unless someone can convince me that Clans United isn't a good thing for European players and they need a new league, I just don't think its right to fracture the community between two competing options.<br>

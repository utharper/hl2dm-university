	<div class="content">Ah it's so disappointing you guys don't think we put any thought into map picking. <br>
<br>
This season brings some changes, First of all for the first time ever Lockdown revised will not be at the top of the upper bracket. That means a major match will take place on amplitude. So you get to play it in the pre season and regular season so that you have plenty of chances to see it in competitive play. IE no excuses about not knowing the map. (which I still get from people IE the thread starter now days). Also by playing it in the first round you can't get knocked out by the map until later, and only 1 team can be knocked out by it.<br>
<br>
Second in order to keep the season moving so teams who do not make the play offs or are knocked out early can start the next season again we have shortened the play offs. 6 matches take place in 3 weeks. This is a very short time frame and  it was very purposeful to not have more then 4 maps played in that time frame, and I was considering only 3 but certainly not bumping it up to 5 or 6 maps. <br>
<br>
The new maps were not released until after we had scheduled. There was no time to give them some real scrutiny in competitive play. Under normal circumstances there is no way I would have even allowed such maps to pass by with my admins. But due to them being built for the U and many competitive players having input on their revisions I did allow them 1 spot in the regular season. Of course early in the regular season. If they prove to be good maps and fit a niche not yet occupied, or even displace another map then they will see further seasons. <br>
<br>
As for amplitude this is quite frankly the best map there is out there for competitive play to date. If you want to discuss why I believe that or you might not we can do that in another thread in the mapping forum. Heck it might even teach people something about how to make maps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have to agree whole heartedly with Fearsome* on this. Amplitude has the same domination factor as Lockdown and Lostvillage. Dominating, or controlling a map in a match is crucial. The weapon placement is excellent, ect ect. If more mappers spent more time with strategic weapon placement , as they did with the level building, alot of map's would be more fun. Example: you may spend from 2-6+ month's building a map, then throw the weapon's in, in one day.<br>
<br>
As for the repetition of the map, I'm sure it was well thought out, and infact this season's map list is more relaxed then any other season. Several new map's were included, that quite frankly, aren't up to snuff. <br>
<br>
Dm_lostarena is probably one of the best map's I've seen for DM in a long time. Swot did an excellent job on that map. I'm glad it's included, and seeing it on pub's. ;D</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I hope by that you mean the LACK of admins since there really were only 2 up until about 2 weeks ago and it really made no sense for the new person to review them so late in the process.  This of course is in addition to the fact that the maps were not able to be reviewed extensively prior to release.  <br>
<br>
I also have to agree that Amplitude is a great map.  The more I play it in scrim situations the more Iike it for scrims.  The weapons layout is top notch and even though the RPG area is still a major control point, it can be overcome by the other team.  It makes the play very dynamic and interesting.  Unlike some of the other maps (LV, Zeta) which, once one team becomes entrenched it is very difficult for the other team to change the situation.<br>
<br>
Also think the new maps are awesome.  But they need more testing.  Lostarena is great map and will be fun to play either in 1v1 or 2v2 imo.  The more I play Caverns, the more I like it for competitive play or even just for fun bacause of the layout of the different areas (high and low) the switchbacks and the awesome jumps.  I need to play Aftermath more to be sure how it is going to be in competitive play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Last night was the first night in over a month (except for maybe Christmas) that I did not see Fearsome idling on the DM IRC channel.  Ko-Tau is there almost as much if not as much.    I dont see them playing so they must be doing something related to DM at least part of that time.   If thats not dedication I dont know what is.  I think they must have had at least one conversation regarding the maps for this season.  Fearsome and I play tested one on my server one night (I wont name it).  Frankly the map sucks and should not be a map for competitive play.   I have found Fearsome to have quite and extensive knowledge of a vast number of DM maps (he should hes been playing long enough).  I dont know all the reasoning behind the choices but I am sure there was quite a bit of thought put into it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

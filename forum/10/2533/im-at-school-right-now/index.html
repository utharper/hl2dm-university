@ 3.30 est we're going to a meeting to be told about the 2nd round of layoff's coming to our company. the kid in teh cube behind me left b/c he got sacked. (i always loved that english expression for getting fired) he was a fuck up who took to many smoke breaks and while i'm a little bumbed out he's gone, i'm more pissed i'll probably receive a share of his work now that he's gone. if you ever get called into your bosses office on a friday...late...you're probably fired. they turned his key card off, they turned his lgn/pw info off. all morning he's like "man, i can't get into JD Edwards(accnting sw we use)". after that i kinda knew he was fucked.<br>

401(k)= profit sharing retirement fund. from what google/wiki tells me p45 is a form you fill out after being fired? am i close?<br>
<br>
some compaines in the US offer to contribute $ to your retirement fund from your gross income before income taxes are taken.<br>
so t.rowe price (a financial investment firm) has a retirement account for me that my employer and i both contribute.<br>
<br>
This is based upon my age and needs they put the money into small cap funds/moneymarket funds/ mutual funds/stocks/bonds etc...<br>
<br>
Because i'm young and 30 years from retirement i selected agressive portfolio and have lost a chunk% of the previous net value....but hell i'm not near retirement like some people who've lost a whole lot more than me...christ i am thirsty for a glass of burbon right now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Soon to be retired folks who are still mostly in stocks only have themself to blame as you should be moved into mostly fixed income securities once your retirement horizon is less than 5 years.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Probably something to do with Friday being the last day in a working week or because Friday is typically considered as being pay day therefore making it easy to adjust the books.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Coming from management I learned, it's done on Friday because you are less likely to hold a grudge and or cause a scene at the workplace, because Friday is an easygoing day considering the thought of the weekend was already on your mind.<br>

Pretty loosely based but it does work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

that's exactly what it was, or at least that's what the sociology class that I took on the subject said it was.  and as long as I was at my old job, everyone who was fired was fired on Friday, which would tend to back that theory up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

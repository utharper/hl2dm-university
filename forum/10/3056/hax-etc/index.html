You came into the Khaos server a little while ago (Saturday night) and said to my clan co-leader that we were accusing you of hax.  He had no idea what you were talking about because he was not there and he does not read these forums.<br>

For the record, I did happen to see on HLSW, several people on the Khaos Friday night before I went to bed.  I saw yourself, another BOSS member, some EC members, and an SW member on the server, but there were no Khaos members on the server.  I dont know what went on or what they said happened so dont assume that because it happened on our server that we are the ones accusing you or anyone of anything.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">for the record, i did record someone hacking last night on the Khaos server.<br>
it was someone under the alias neo! for those who were suspecting Evil Monkey, i don't think he was hacking, although,<br>
he was there as well, both neo and evil monkey used their mics, and based off that deduction neo is not evil monkey's hacking alias!<br>
my footage clearly shows the culprit, and how the view is flipped and preposterous amounts of headshots. all from neo!<br>
<br>
now monkey has improved and seems to have gotten a lot better with his aim in the past couple of weeks.<br>
however this is not uncommon as long as he shows logged hours for that work. and he shows just over 60 hours<br>
on hl2dm in the past 2 weeks. he showed me the aim_practice_v1 map which is all about timings.<br>
seems logical to me that he has a solid case for his training. i also know monkey to have been dissing hackers before!<br>
so i think we shouldn't jump to conclusions until we get more substantial evidence that could say otherwise about monkey.<br>
for now my standing against monkey is that he's showing good progress in improving his aim, without the use of hax.<br>
now if anyone can prove otherwise please feel free to do so. i am willing to hear a solid argument with adequate evidence to back their argument.<br>
<br>
anyway without further ado, here are the demos i have recorded of neo!<br>

	<div class="content">so i guess i was wrong about evil monkey<br>
he got vac banned today!<br>
i feel somewhat disappointed that i vouched for him.<br>
steam proved otherwise.<br>
i knew something was fishy<br>
he did get extremely good in a short amount of time.<br>
it wasn't the fact that he didn't do headshots a lot<br>
matter a fact, he never did headshots<br>
he always got a body shot and pretty much always!<br>
it was 2 shots dead, 2 shots dead type of thing.<br>
anyway, he says i spectated him, which i kind of did,<br>
but not too long and didn't pay much attention<br>
i recall a friend telling me about aimbot hacks being able<br>
to enable and disable on the fly while in mid-game<br>
so i never doubted the possibility that he was hacking<br>
just wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt<br>
oh well, sorry for the misjudgment call.<br>

I'm not trying to stick up for anyone. I'm just sick of the hatefulness on this topic.

Take Care, All <br>
and don't forget to be respectful to your fellow players!<br>

p.s. only reason EVIL MONKEY banned most of you from [BOSS] Clan Server is because its obvious you're not there to play, but to give us a hard time. We're there to have fun, not to rip on others to make ourselves look better. Please be respectful to all and everyone.

	<div class="content">Why is it funny that someone gets banned by hacking? What's SO funny and hilarious about someone getting banned who insists that they dont hack? What part of any of that makes it funny? unless you're 12 years old? do you see Munster laughing? Do you see him pissing his pants and 'quoting' other to make stupid posts? NO. You don't. Why? Because he acts his age.<br>
<br>
And to all else who laugh about EVIL MONKEY's caps, to tell you the truth its either an accident which after typing, he doesn't care to correct..Or it's just the way he types! He writes me in caps all the time, and i don'take it as him yelling or being pissy. It's just the way he types. And about the correction in spelling, if i were the one talking trash, like most here,  i'd check my spelling before speaking a comeback!! because most of your spelling is way off! and i'm not one to correct crap like that but i do pick it up if you're talking trash on someone who mis spells things, when you yourself can't write correctly. Use some sense. And what's with all the 'quoting' one another as a post?? can't you guys come up with something creative from your own mind, to say? i guess not.<br>
<br>
I think the reason most of you think it's funny is to try and fit in with everyone else here who thinks it's funny. I really do. Why else would you waste your time with some useless thread like this? ..plus the day whoever reported the thread to steam, EVIL MONKEY was mysteriously banned so don't sit there and tell me it's only VAC automated.

If you are implying that someone here got Monkey Vac banned and that anyone that plays a steam game can get anyone else banned just because they want to, then whatever you read or someone told you was dead wrong.  Vac bans are controlled by Valve and Valve alone.<br>
<br>
Here is what you should have read.  <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-RADZ-6869" class="postlink">https://support.steampowered.com/kb_art ... -RADZ-6869</a><br>
<br>
This is how it works specifically from that website: <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#BF0000">The Valve Anti-Cheat system is enabled for servers displaying the Secured shield logo. If a user connects to a VAC-Secured server from a computer with identifiable cheats installed, the VAC system will ban the user from playing on VAC-Secured servers in the future.<br>
<br>
While server admins may choose to ban specific players, server admins cannot VAC ban players. The VAC system is automated - contacting Steam Support to report cheaters is not necessary, nor will Steam Support act on any information provided.<br>

VAC is not perfect but they do catch a lot of people, the way is done has nothing to do with people reporting you or saying they saw you hacking, it has to do with what the server records.<br>
<br>
If anyone is stupid enough to try hacks for fun, try them on a server that VAC doesn't secure, the thing is when people get a hold of these the first thing they want to do is show the people that once kick their ass that they have gotten so much better [usually in a couple of weeks]<br>

I thought it was confirming what I've read before and heard from some other players that HL2DM University board members were members of Valve and helped run the VAC anti-cheat system. I'm not so gulible as you would think, because I heard about it from many respected players that I don't see why they would make lies about VAC. I can be very skeptical, yet equally open minded. Maybe they were just misinformed as well. When hearing alot about that, in-game, after seeing the backtalk EVIL MONKEY was giving you guys and vice versa, I should not have assumed that it was true, to believe board members can ban, over what the rules specify on the VAC site. In a sense I phucked up!! And Seagull, I still don't know why all you guys think it's funny for the reasons you do but I apologize for being rude, I was just sick of the rude remarks I was recieving and the ignorance about what was so funny about something so stupid.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#BF4040">Paradox, Thanks for explaining, to me, the VAC rules over again. I was just confused as crap. I understand what you guys are talking about, that it's not possible for anyone to get a player banned with any kind of evidence. That it's purely automated. I was told, prior, that if you had a recorded demo of proof, it was enough to take care of the problem. I know now, I heard dead wrong. Sorry man, and yes I agree from one of your past posts here, that EVIL MONKEY kind of set himself up, got himself in this pickle, by not being absolutely honest about himself hacking. I guess once you're pointed out, you're too embarrased to be straight forward, which results in loss of trust, loss of respect, and hard take seriously. I've found that out, here. Most of you guys are chill but alot of you are really rude and empty hearted in your posts. Is it just a way to fit in? Or do you just like getting a rise out of people, say like a bully would, they love it when they get a reply, they feed off of you. Well, Thanks for making things clearer.</span> <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#BF00BF">Shinigami <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> Thank You so much for always being nice to me. I really appreciate it. You're always too kind, and you are the most AWESOME to play with. You're always lookin'out for your friends, I am very greatful that we met when we did. I understand what you say when we've noticed that EVIL MONKEY had got alot better in two weeks, in what seemed for me, to be about just 1 week. He'd been working alot of hours and never really had the time to play for a few days every week, not even time for the weekends really. But when he did come back, he had been doing alot better than prior to working, like really fast, he got good immediately after having such a long haitus. I'm don't mean to say that he sucked before then, he was always really good at his game, before all this came up, before he had that job that took up all his time. It's just he wasn't THAT good, immediately after quiting. I thought in the back of my mind numerous times that he might've been using a hack because I never stood a chance in-game with him, as soon as he'd see me I'm dead or two shots and I'm dead, never ever missed which made me contemplate it. Even REPOMANCER thought he was hacking a few nights ago, and left [BOSS] because of it. I miss his company, he was fun to play with, he's a real good player like Sadistical is! Anyway, Thanks for being a great friend, PoMp! &lt;3</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#408000">Walking Target, Yes I feel betrayed of what he did, because if he was VAC banned then it means that he had to have been cheating. It just sucks to have your own leader, who was already good, use cheats just to keep first place in rank scores and to ruin his reputation in HL2DM. Yes, it's disappointing to me, but I still consider him a friend of mine. I don't hate him, or dislike him. I just wish he made the right choices and stayed away from that no-fun cheat crap. Trying is better than cheating because it's good experience and it makes the fun of the game last forever. I believe, using cheats just takes the fun out of it all. And I like to have FUN! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> Also, Thank You for telling me they were just joking about the VAC ban thing. I couldn't tell what was serious from the jokes.

VAC is not perfect but they do catch a lot of people, the way is done has nothing to do with people reporting you or saying they saw you hacking, it has to do with what the server records.

From what I've heard, VAC has only screwed up once. I just read that from lurking the steam forums.<br>

Seagull, I didn't know your EDIT was supposed to be a joke. I thought it was confirming what I've read before and heard from some other players that HL2DM University board members were members of Valve and helped run the VAC anti-cheat system. I'm not so gulible as you would think, because I heard about it from many respected players that I don't see why they would make lies about VAC. I can be very skeptical, yet equally open minded. Maybe they were just misinformed as well. When hearing alot about that, in-game, after seeing the backtalk EVIL MONKEY was giving you guys and vice versa, I should not have assumed that it was true, to believe board members can ban, over what the rules specify on the VAC site. In a sense I phucked up!! And Seagull, I still don't know why all you guys think it's funny for the reasons you do but I apologize for being rude, I was just sick of the rude remarks I was recieving and the ignorance about what was so funny about something so stupid.</div></blockquote></div>

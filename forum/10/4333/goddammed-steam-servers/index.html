	<div class="content">There was an announcement two days ago:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Beginning at 6:00 pm Pacific time Thursday August 6th, we will be performing software maintenance on some Steam servers. We expect the resulting downtime to last three hours at most, putting the end of the window at 9:00 pm Pacific time. <br>
<br>
Some Steam services will be offline during this time. Affected services will include the Steam Community, in-game matchmaking or lobbies, downloading games from Steam content servers, and making purchases from the Steam store. Games that do not rely on Steam matchmaking services should remain playable.<br>
<br>
News updates and any further information will be posted in this space.<br>
<br>
We will work to make this downtime as short as possible. Thank you for your patience!

<br>
And for what its worth this seems to happen 2 -3 times a week at least.  Those servers sure do need alot of maintenance.  Funny thing is until a few months ago they were almost never down.  Of course I am talking about after they got them sorted out a few years ago when they used to be retarded and we all used Xfire anyway.<br>

<br>
yes, but steam is world wide and there really is no time that ppl are working all over the world.  BUT, i do agree that the USA must be their biggest customers so to do it at 6pm PST seems kind of stupid.  with that said, i would rather have them do 2 hours of maintenance if it helps the system from going down all the time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Frankly I could care less about how many users there are in one place verses another.  My point was they could do the Euro servers at 7 - 10 AM Euro time and the North/ South American servers at 7-10 their time.  THAT would make sense and everyone would be happy.

	<div class="content">Actually that steam article does nothng but prove my point.  2300 their local time is 2AM my time which is fine by me because most of the time I am sleeping then.   Their servers have been down a lot lately which indicates the are having a lot of problems which as much as we complain about Valve around here, it seem to fit in with the general opinion that Valve customer service is less than stellar at times.<br>
<br>
As far as a customer being "smarter than valve"..Who is paying their bills by buying their games?  Also with what is going on with companies all over the world right now, Im not so sure I would go so far as to say that the corporate world is so much above the consumer upon which the rely on for their very livlihood.<br>
<br>
And Soiz, my clan all reinstalled xfire to use as a backup to steam.  Problem solved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Keefy, where do you get that from my post?  Did you even read what I said?!  I did not say they should schedule the whole world to US time.   I said that there is no reason why they cant do the US servers at off peak hours during US time and the Euro servers on off peak hours during Euro time.  That way it works out for EVERYONE not just Euros, Australians, Japan, India, US, Canada, South America, etc, etc.   BTW the world doesnt revolve around Europe either, and the attitude that Europe has more users so the rest of the world should be fucked over is BS.  In any case this convo is getting stupid, so Im done with it.  We installed xfire, our issue is resolved, Steam can be as retarded as it wants and it wont keep our clan from getting together when we need to.  Thanks for playing.  gg.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

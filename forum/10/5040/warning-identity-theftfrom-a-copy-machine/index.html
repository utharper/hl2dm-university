	<div class="content">I my self did not know photocopiers had hard drives that permanently store every thing it scans and prints. This just bring up the question who was the designer or engineer who through it was a good idea to use such a thing. I mean seriously this is one big oversight that should not cost $500 to get around, it should loss all data stored when the device has no power there is no need for hard drives to store them forever or simply erase all data stored on power up which is only a little bit of code. That sharp guy or what ever he is just trying to screw companies out of more money saying it cost more to have something that should all ready be there to comply with law and consumer protection. It their responsibility to provide secure photocopier and printers not the companies who have not a clue that the device have such a basic flaw.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its unbelievable to me that years, even decades have passed and we just now find out Copiers keep images of everything on a Hard Drive!?!?<br>
<br>
What is happening to mankind? Are we becoming completely incompetent?<br>
Did this "just slip" someone's attention!?!?<br>
Did copier manufacturers EVER think, "well, gee, you think these hard drives might impact information security!?!?!"<br>
Jeeez  F'in Seinfeld!<br>

Edit: What is just as bizarre is the Sharps guy saying the option for a little piece of software, a FUCKING APPLET, that erases the copies is FIVE FUCKING HUNDRED DOLLARS!!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not surprising, the last copier my company purchased was about 50k. $500 is nothing when it comes to corporate purchasing and they can easily charge such an amount and not even be questioned.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

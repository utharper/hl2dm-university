<br>
If you get a spare hour or two in your day I highly reccomend watching both of these series. Don't worry both of these series were made for idiots like you and me and don't include higher mathematical equations that would fry our brains. This is about a groundbreaking theory of "everything", a theory that will eventually not only master our own universe, but will begin to shatter the walls of the relatively unknown membrane mutliverse.<br>
<br>
String Theory Series, turns into m-theory (Reccomend before watching next series) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ogniank#p/u/13/E7FV9aaiwKQ" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/user/ogniank#p/u/13/E7FV9aaiwKQ</a><br>
<br>
Membrane Theory Series (Skip first series if familiar with string theory); <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yEu-b_YD0" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-yEu-b_YD0</a><br>
<br>
What is interesting is the M-Theory rising to strong prominence over the last decade is crumbling walls of universal equations and the mystery of the singularity. M-theory has essentially unlocked the door to mastering our universe in the field of quantum mechanics. While at an infant stage eventually the quantum field of mechanics and math will over time be able to solve nearly all of the major mysteries of our own universe with the building block of M-Theory. Over time as quantum mechanics is able to replicate and master 2 dimensional plains and create equations and predictions based on the 11th dimension along with being able to perfectly replicate the conditions for a mini black hole, we will be able to effectively plant a seed and create a universe.<br>
<br>
This would not make us a God in the conventional mythical sense, we could not design the lifeforms as we please, we could only seed a universe, after which we would no longer have control. It could be we create failed universes, ones in which only the laws of electrons are obeyed, or we could conceivable create a universe with the exact same physical laws as our own, in essence a universe that would guarentee the birth of intelligent life. One begins to see after watching both series the paradox that not everything has a beginning, that energy is never gained nor lost, and that by creating our universe one day we can see in a practical sense how the birth and deaths of universes are infinite and eternal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

hmm not really sure how to respond to that. You countered with vaguely philosophic and untrue claims. You do know mathematics can descibe why a rose looks like how it is? Let me put it this way without getting TL;DR, black holes can create universes, and we can create black holes even right now.<br>
<br>
CERN is projected to produce hundreds of miniature black holes over the decades, but none stable enough to create a universe. As time goes on it is feasible humans will be able to grasp the collision technology to create an electrically nuetral stable black hole. One that could give birth to a universe, but as it being electrically nuetral would do no damage to our own earth. The most foolish thing of all is to say "It can't be done". <br>
<br>
Its very possible we can even travel faster then the speed of light by distorting space time fabric, which is physically possible, but isnt really "traveling" in the conventional sense. Its like say, having a rug spread across the entire world, you start from point A, and point B at the other end of the world lies a Angelina Jolie clone that is a virgin. You must travel this rug to reach the clone virgin Angelina (which if you are a straight man you want to do), except you can just fabricate a machine to quickly ravel the rug and bring her to you in hours instead of taking years to walk to her.<br>
<br>
BTW "who" is important in the universe is just a philosophical debate, I myelf view myself as unimportant in the broad scheme of things.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

And i think that consciousness/life could possibly be quantified, just whether or not it can be proved or will be by Humans is another story. Obviously the universal consciousness theory is the only thing that makes sense to me at this point in time. I think it makes sense that all life in the universe gets its subconscious/instincts from the universe itself somehow the only problem is finding out why a consciousness/processing power/database/wateva da fark exists and how it came into existence etc.<br>

	<div class="content">A poet once said, "The whole universe is in a glass of wine." We will probably never know in what sense he meant that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look at a glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe. There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the Earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe's age, and the evolution of stars. What strange arrays of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering, as did Louis Pasteur, the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it! If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts — physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on — remember that Nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let it give us one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!   ~ Richard Feynman</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's kind of funny you may have accidently quoted one of the biggest opponents of string theory, I doubt you did it intentionally. Feynman was part of the old guard physics machinery that stifled the air of development in string theory, he died when string theory equations started to all link together. I think if Feynman were alive when Edward Whitten in 1995 succesfully pieced together the disorganized, messy string theorum into M-Theory he might've had to resign his bitterness towards the "Theory of everything".<br>
<br>
M-Theory is truly a revolution in science, the biggest since general relativity. It seems easy for older men, familiar with the way things were to grasp onto the past, its comfortable and provides resolute and familiar answers.<br>
<br>
Counter quote, "An important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul."<br>
<br>
"What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out and that the growing generation is familiarized with the idea from the beginning.<br>

	<div class="content">I don't believe there should be this argument. We can imagine and investigate things and find out that they could be possible but our society will refuse to allow this to happen. Organizations are too greedy - keeping us back, people cling onto the familiar which creates values - and as long as someone will oppose we will never continue to create things such as universes or travel faster than the speed of light.<br>
<br>
As far as I see, the only reason why we have improved in technology in the last hundred years is because of war and there is no direct evidence there is going to be any large 'physical' wars in the future. By physical I mean eradication of whole countries by force not by conspicuous advertising and lifestyle changes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I'm not a physician, or knowledgable the mathematical ways in which it can work but an article came out recently in Discover that seems to support my long-term prediction about black holes. There are 3 types of civilizations it is speculated, at the third level these creatures can harness Planck energy, or the energy to create black holes, and it seems from this article, the ability to create universes.<br>
<br>
Here is the article about black holes, and an amazing peak inside of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Andrew Hamilton is an astrophysicist and computer programmer. He programmed a graphics progam meant for designing video games with over 100,000 lines of code in the form of general relativity equations and as complex as todays modeling programs on super computers. He noticed weird things at first which were then later proven true, for example, when approaching the event horizon, where nothing can return without accelerating faster than light, reality seems to optically split in half as you approach. When you cross the outer event horizon, space itself is falling faster than light, creating a cascade of flowing energy. After dumping his old model, of a non-rotating, uncharged black hole and coming up with a realistic, rotating, charged black hole, Steve discovered that a charged black hole actually has a second, inner event horizon. Roger Penrose, a physics legend, formerly showed that something must happen at the inner of the hole, where all the energy and material is sucked in, and is piled up.<br>
<br>
After plugging in more of Einsteins field equations and seeing what that meant for the inside of the black hole, Steve discovered something astounding: the inner event horizon maybe the most chaotic and violently unstable place in the universe. Building on the work of previous physicists Eric Poisson and Werner Israel, he describes the inner horizon as an inflationary instability. "This is because everything-mass-energy-pressure-- keeps growing exponentially and the surface cannot sustain itself and must eventually collapse."<br>
<br>
This is where it gets interesting, when an object approaches the inner horizon of a rotating black hole, it goes on one of two beam paths, dependent on which direction the object is moving in relation to the spin of the black hole. Particles entering opposite the spin join an "ingoing beam" that has positive energy and goes forward in time. While particles entering at the same direction of rotation, joins an outgoing beam with negative energy moving backward in time.<br>
<br>
"The inner horizon acts as an astonishingly powerful particle accelerator, shooting the ingoing and outgoing beams past each other at nearly the speed of light.[Hamilton 34]<br>
<br>
This picture came to him from, simply "staring at the mathematics, from staring at Einsteins equations." <br>
<br>
Once the particle accelerator starts, it never stops. The faster the moving streams, the more energy; there more energy, the more gravity, and the faster it accelerates. [34]<br>
<br>
The black holes inner accelerator could spawn entire new universes. Something like our universe forming could occur inside a black hole, where mini black holes are formed at the inner horizon while connected to it's mother black hole such as an infants umbilical cord like a miniscule wormhole until it breaks off "to pursue a destiny completely removed from our own." "If there's anywhere in our universe where baby universes are being created, it's likely happening inside black holes" [35].<br>
<br>
If you wanted to venture into the inner horizon, which I would recommend against, Hamilton describes it as "'taking particles from your body, and slam them against particles coming the other way at Planck-scale energies'-conditions associated with the distance of about 10^-35 meter and energies about a quadrillion time what the LHC can acheive" [37].</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Actually, science is godlike. One day we can create limbs from mere cells, one day we can stop aging, one day we can produce humans genetically modified exactly how we want them to be. Of course whether all this is allowed to be legal is another question. Science could one day allow to us manipulate space time fabric, and manipulate entire galaxies if we live long enough, it's only a matter of time if we continue to survive when we can monitor, create or destroy other civlizations.<br>

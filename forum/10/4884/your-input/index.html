	<div class="content">Hey guys I am hoping that you can help me with a assignment I have. Don't worry I am not asking you to do the work for me but my assignment requires me to gather information on customer views and I wondering if you guys can give reviews on a gaming mouse.<br>
<br>
This is for my innovation management module for uni and the exercise is all about product development and analytical process of products. I chosen to look at three product Logitech G5, Razer Deathadder, SteelSeries Xai.<br>
<br>
So give me you statement on these products or any another other gaming mouse. Any feedback would be much appreciated.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The g5 is fun for the first 2 weeks, but it cannot handle "man hands" and breaks with more ease than a roasted pretzel, it also cannot handle acceleration well at all, any form of fast acceleration and it's laser falls flat on it's face, it's been tested time and time again.<br>
<br>
They have a great return policy but the mouse is fragile and fails at advertised performance, and older models misfire killing the "gaming grade" it's been assigned.<br>
<br>
However logitech has recognized the issues with the g5 laser and corrected while releasing the G-500 model mouse and that mouse has a proven laser that can handle any speed you throw at it, I just hope it can handle "man hands" but I man handle shit so that might not matter to the average consumer.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I will buy a g-500 or a deathadder.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT: Can't forget to mention that the g5 wheel is a horrible design and part of the fragility, the wheels side buttons fail too fast and the wheel itself is too high up over the mouses profile I used to use mouse 3 for secondary fire, the g5 forced me to use the thumb button for secondary, now that is failing too. The wheel uses the laser to read clicks and that's a brilliant idea on paper, but the laser works too good some times it will read clicks even though your only putting pressure on the wheel not turning it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have long fingers so lots of other mice feel too small for me.  I also like the weights because, IMO they provide a smoother, more controlled glide.  The DPI level seems well matched as I can set for low sens/high DPI and get pretty good performance out of it for any game.<br>

	<div class="content">Xai poons all, it really is awsome. DEFINITLY not cheap, nice feel, VERY good laser, most responsive mouse i have used, and i say that being the owner of a mx518.<br>
Also the LCD screen and onboard profiles(u can adjust ur dpi and other settings ON THE MOUSE), and ability to use without installing any drivers makes it pure win, and handy if u go to lans. Also has chunky mouse feet, perfect buttons and once u see it in real life u really notice how good the coating on the mouse is, the screenshots kinda make it look bland but in rl it looks quite nice i think, and just the right amount of grip.<br>
I watched lots of utube videos an watnot b4 i bought this mouse, and the only complaints i heard was the mouse didnt read curtain surfaces very well, and the main surface in question was was i was using, didnt have a problem, i did however get a new mousepad though cause i needed more glide.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">my experience with the death adder was short lived.  although i admit it was the best feeliing mouse ive ever had.  when it worked, it was magnificent.  but it developed tracking issues after about one year.  razer insisted it was just a dirty lense and had me cleaning the damn thing daily.  i finally gave up.  i was less than satisfied with razers responses to the issue.  i also found the firmware updates for the adder to be a pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
i changed to a g5.  it felt bulky/clunky in my hand after the adder.  within 30 days, the g5 began dying at random times.  logitech was good about replacing the mouse.  the second mouse also began dying within 30 days.  again, logitech replaced it.  3rd mouse, same result.  i believe the problem was with the braided cord.  my set up uses a computer drawer.  the braided cord is very stiff.  there isnt a lot of room in the computer drawer and the braided cord eventually gets 'bent' in an almost 90 degree angle... right at the nose of the mouse.  i think this was causing the mouse to short out, or power off.  after the 3rd mouse, logitech sent me 2 mx518's... with a little negotiating on my part.  ive been very happy with the mx518 thus far.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's like a spin look at the ceiling followed by a pathetic response for a few.<br>

The wheel does stink, is too high, too dodgy.<br>
It DOES feel sturdy compared to my old Copperhead.<br>

I crushed two of those and 2 518s.<br>
The Copperhead was a great mouse except the ridiculous irritating firmware loading and disappearing.<br>
The Copperhead was small and caused pain in my hand.<br>

I don't think the G-5 is very well shaped, is not that responsive, not that awesome like the Copperhead was awesome. I mean purely as a mouse. The Razer's are Fast twitch tight and fast.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Buy whatever's comfortable to you and get used to your hardware. May it be mice or sound or whatever.<br>

VDuS Bio-Hazard used the Microsoft mouse he got with his bestbuy tower and had a piece of paper for mousepad and would do incredibly good given what he used. <br>

It WILL feel more comfortable, it WILL have better instant results, but i'm pretty sure it's nothing but buying you time in the end because i've seen really good players using real crappy hardware.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've used the MX 518 for a while. Since 2006 I think. Never ever failed me and all I've had to switch was the mousepad.<br>
<br>
Second half of last year the feet for the mouse started to show wear and finally decided that it was time to look for a new mouse. Wasn't untl the beginning of this year when I finally decided on one. I was looking at Razer mice and for a while I was thinking the Mamba would have been a good choice. The only things that held me back were its price tag and the shape it had. Then I saw that razer released a brand new mouse, The Imperator, and on a whim decided on that one. Had the same tech from the mamba but different design and cheaper(Mostly because its not wireless.)<br>
<br>
I've tried other Razer mice before and I absolutely hated the design of them but this one, I dare say, feels like I'm holding a more form-fitting 518. The side buttons are adjustable for anyone and the pads on it cover the right spots. This mouse is performing better than my old 518 and is more ergonomic to boot. <br>
<br>
I'm glad I got it on a whim because it did not disappoint. I have yet to find an issue with it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

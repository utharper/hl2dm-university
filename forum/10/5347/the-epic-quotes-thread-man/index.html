I'll start with John Stuart Mill, father of modern western political thought and had one of the highest IQ's ever recorded.<br>
<br>
"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind." <br>
<br>
"A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself."<br>

LOL why don't you actually read all of John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty", then go read the entireity of Marx's Communist Manifesto like I've had to as a political science major. Basically what you just did there is call a cat a dog, but actually worse. <br>

Yeah actually Mill was denounced as a radical for going against the king during his era when his first works came out. Also Mill is a favorite of the libertarians in contemporary politics, not liberals.<br>

LOL relevance of this quote just skyrocketed by coincidence today. I was just watching an older episode of Frontline where the former slush fund manager of Siemens corp said there's an 11th comandment pertaining to the business world of bribing politicians and lawmen, "Don't get caught". <br>

Out of the night that covers me, <br>

For my unconquerable soul. <br>

In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>

Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>
My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br>

Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>
And yet the menace of the years <br>

	<div class="content">"Now, I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country. Men, all this stuff you’ve heard about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung. Americans traditionally love to fight. All real  Americans love the sting of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big league ball player, the toughest boxer. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn’t give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That’s why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. Because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.<br>
<br>
Now, an Army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team. This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap. The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality for the Saturday Evening Post don’t know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating.<br>
<br>
We have the finest food and equipment, the best spirit and the best men in the world. You know, by God I actually pity those poor bastards we’re going up against. By God, I do. We’re not just going to shoot the bastards, we’re going to cut out their living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We’re going to murder those lousy Hun bastards by the bushel.<br>
<br>
Now, some of you boys, I know, are wondering whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you will all do your duty. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them. Spill their blood. Shoot them in the belly. When you put your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment before was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do.<br>
<br>
Now there’s another thing I want you to remember. I don’t want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We’re not holding anything. Let the Hun do that. We are advancing constantly and we’re not interested in holding onto anything except the enemy. We're going to hold onto him by the nose and we're going to kick him in the ass. We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time and we're gonna go through him like crap through a goose.<br>
<br>
There’s one thing that you men will be able to say when you get back home. And you may thank God for it. Thirty years from now when you’re sitting around your fireside with your grandson on your knee and he asks you what did you do in the great World War II, you won’t have to say, "Well, I shoveled shit in Louisiana."<br>
<br>
Alright now, you sons-of-bitches, you know how I feel. Oh, and I will be proud to lead you wonderful guys into battle – anytime, anywhere.<br>
<br>
That’s all."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country. Men, all this stuff you’ve heard about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung. Americans traditionally love to fight. All real  Americans love the sting of battle. When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big league ball player, the toughest boxer. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn’t give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That’s why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. Because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.<br>
<br>
Now, an Army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team. This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap. The bilious bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality for the Saturday Evening Post don’t know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating.<br>
<br>
We have the finest food and equipment, the best spirit and the best men in the world. You know, by God I actually pity those poor bastards we’re going up against. By God, I do. We’re not just going to shoot the bastards, we’re going to cut out their living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We’re going to murder those lousy Hun bastards by the bushel.<br>
<br>
Now, some of you boys, I know, are wondering whether or not you'll chicken out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you will all do your duty. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them. Spill their blood. Shoot them in the belly. When you put your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment before was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do.<br>
<br>
Now there’s another thing I want you to remember. I don’t want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We’re not holding anything. Let the Hun do that. We are advancing constantly and we’re not interested in holding onto anything except the enemy. We're going to hold onto him by the nose and we're going to kick him in the ass. We're going to kick the hell out of him all the time and we're gonna go through him like crap through a goose.<br>
<br>
There’s one thing that you men will be able to say when you get back home. And you may thank God for it. Thirty years from now when you’re sitting around your fireside with your grandson on your knee and he asks you what did you do in the great World War II, you won’t have to say, "Well, I shoveled shit in Louisiana."<br>
<br>
Alright now, you sons-of-bitches, you know how I feel. Oh, and I will be proud to lead you wonderful guys into battle – anytime, anywhere.<br>
<br>
That’s all."</div></blockquote>

That is hilarious. Especially the part about the finest food - priceless! Gotta &lt;3 American bullshit art. If anything encapsulates american rhetoric (to me anyway) it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hopNAI8Pefg" class="postlink">Jack Nicholson's Court speech in <em class="text-italics">A Few Good Men</em></a> as the borderline Col. Jessep. What a spin.<br>
But you gotta hand it to them - THIS is how you get out of trouble. When Jews are in trouble they don't say a thing, leaving you to guesses, further deepening the pit they're in, while Americans just storm into these glorious omnipotent speeches where truth and false, right and wrong dissolve and morph into a sales pitch.<br>

YOu know what I just realized after watching this? ---&gt; <object width="320" height="265"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/mj2_KHrig5Q&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/mj2_KHrig5Q&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="320" height="265"></embed></object><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj2_KHrig5Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Link</a> One comedian and one TV show called Family Guy ripped off this guys jokes in this one clip alone, and after watching another clip about him on dinosaurs I realized Lewis Black ripped that off without even attempting to cover it up. <br>

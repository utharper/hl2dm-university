	<div class="content">Boy Howdy. You just contradicted yourself.<br>
<br>
I really like L4D. The level design is superb.<br>
The characters are cool.<br>
Lots of fun.<br>
<br>
And then 2 comes along. Buy it for full boat, its the NEW!<br>
It's like L4D was sold and then abandoned, in favor of new melee, lousy levels, irritating avatars, irritating headjumpers, for full price.<br>
<br>
Frankly, i have never had the feeling of being ripped off so much as the L4D and 2 deal.<br>
2 didn't even play smoothly.<br>
It offered little that was better.<br>
It is not as good as L4D, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
2 seems like an expansion of the first, a bad one.<br>
A ripoff.<br>
<br>
Yeah it's worth 5 fucking dollars.<br>
I paid a lot more for that shit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've put a good amount of hours into L4D2 since I got it on sale for eight bucks. I bought L4D1 too but never really played it.<br>
The weekly mutations are fun. Does L4D1 even have those?<br>
Most of the fun VS matches happen on No Mercy, Dark Carnival, The Parish, and occasionally Dead Center. All the other maps are either too hard or too easy.<br>
All of the campaigns are fun to play on expert if you have a good group. They're certainly challenging enough and leave you feeling accomplished when you beat their finales. Not because the characters made it and the (non-existent) plot can move forward, but because you used teamwork to accomplish your goal.<br>
Playing single player is useless and boring because the AI is terrible.<br>
Melee is integrated just fine, it's not OP or UP.<br>
The new infected are really fun to use IF your team knows how to work together.<br>
Seriously who the fuck pays that much attention to the characters? It's not an RPG here, just shoot the zombies...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He's right.<br>
Having said that, I've always preferred the first one for it's atmosphere which was far more realistic than the 2nd. AI isn't as smooth as in the 2nd and weapons are FAR better in the 2nd which i guess makes it more sensible to move on. plus L4D2's SDK is superior to the 1st. <br>
Rippof? Money wise, Yes, I have to agree. Though...I'm a silly Valve fanboy...what can i say...I can't help it.<br>
Bottom line: L4D (be it 1 or 2 doesn't matter) is all about team play. nothing more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

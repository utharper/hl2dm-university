I played it for sometime and I do agree underneath all the lag there is a very good co-op and multiplayer which is the most balanced COD yet. Treyarch did say they had a dedicated dev team but it mainly comes down to them not releasing a beta and properly testing it out of a controlled environment (LAN). I am sure they would of done a beta but I am guessing the PR department of Activision prevented that since beta can deflate hype. Heres hoping they patch this up good.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

seriously?  you played MW2 right?  besides IW/treyarch could take a shit in a box, mail it to activision, have activision make 10 million DNA replicas of the shit, box it, advertise it as mr. hanky with a gun and the mindless COD drones would line the streets for the midnight release.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Aside from that i was happy with the way it performed, it has an option for refresh rate which is allways nice, it seemed to be well optimised for sli, and supported sli AA perfectly. <br>

	<div class="content">Even tho the game had some lag issues (both in sp and mp) and some glitches I found the game to be really enjoyable. Do not read the spoiler part if you hate reading spoilers.<br>
<br>
Once a patch is released it will be great to play in mp lag free. I'm a big mp fan, but I'm always down for a good sp story. I think the main goal of Treyarch was just trying to do what Infinity Ward did at their scale, and they did it. So success to them. One thing is for shure, this game is waaaaay better than Medal of Honor. I'm not a COD or MOH fan, but after the last MOH and now Black Ops I'm leaning toward COD as the go to series. The big thing that pissed me off about both MOH and COD:BO is they both had INVISIBLE FREAKING WALLS! WHAT THE CRAP! I hate invisible walls...it just makes any game feel more like your a rat in a maze (which you are anyway) but at least don't make it so obvious. Zombies was fun, loved the ending with the special characters you get to play as, they say some funny stuff.<br>
<br>
That's my 2 cents.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*SPOILER*<br>
It was like the gameplay from mw2, story characters from World at War come back, and the trippyness of Shutter Island. <br>

idk about that Dal.  that is a matter of opinion.  FPS games do have a bigger following than say, a strategy game, but that doesnt make them better.  ill 100% agree with viper, BO will most likely get GOTY if that award is based on unit sales, and thats just sad.  noob friendly FPS games are a dime a dozen, and big money makers.  the more complex and complicated you make a game the less sales you will get.   ive been really into Demon's Souls. IMO, this game should be a requirement for anybody who calls themselves a gamer.  i would love to see some of these idiot BO players give Demon's SOuls a go and see how they do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

ya, this sounds like a bunch of horse shit to me.  wtf is 8gigs of installed files?  how do you DL installed files, that makes no sense. that whole thing screams shady to me.<br>
<br>
*Call of Duty®: Black Ops requires an initial hard drive space of approximately 24GB to download and install the game via digital download (8GB of compressed files, 8GB of decompressed files and 8GB of installed files). Upon installing the game, 16GB (compressed and decompressed files) may be deleted from the hard drive. Please make note of where the compressed and decompressed files are being saved on your hard drive in order to later locate these temporary files for removal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The game feels alot like COD5 in terms of the movement, animation.  The maps are awesome, well thought out, detailed and good size.  The weapons system is also very good.  Hit reg also seems right on.  Now that the server lag is largely fixed, the more I play it the better I like it and the more I enjoy it.</div></blockquote>

im surprised you got this para.  even more surprised you gave it possitive remarks.</div></blockquote>

lol?  Lets face it HL2DM is dead and there will not be another game like it.  I had to find another game that I enjoyed so Ive been buying alot of new games lately.  Its a better game than MOH (which I think kinda sucks) and I have played COD4 and 5 quite a bit.   I also thought that BFBC2 is a great game.  I think this is the best COD of all 3 (COD 4, 5, BO) because the maps are better than COD4 overall and because of all the game modes it has.   I also like the COD credit system so you can choose the weapons you like.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
r_multithreaded_device  --- in console the description states ---- create a virtual d3d device<br>
<br>
<br>
how does that correlate to multi-cores?<br>
<br>
seems like it would have to do with those older CPU's that emulate a 2nd core - something legacy from the q3 engine perhaps? thus why it's disabled?  when I turned it on, it did absolutely nothing.  no fps gain, no lag gain, no cpu usage gain. nadda.  placebo in effect right about now.<br>
<br>
can anyone verify exactly what that description could relate to?<br>
<br>
as far as everyones issue in the game - no clue. worked great from day 1 for me and most I know, aside from the server rate which no one on the steam forums seemed to believe for the longest time.  gtx260 pulling 70-140 all day long .  cpu usage on 4 core averaging 40% from day 1.  <br>
<br>
people have bad hardware,thats my conclusion.<br>
<br>
@ conflict -  Treyarch had amazing support on WaW - free map packs and 7 huge patches, mod support/tools.  Seems like a step above the IW.  They might not be the best in the biz, but IMO they are a PC developer.  <br>
<br>
and for those who cry about console ports - its smart business and if u were an exec.  you would do it to.  It only makes sense to code something now days that can easily be swaped to consoles and pc .  <br>
what you need to cry about is the shitty interns they have doing the porting, not the fact that is playable on 3 different systems.  specifics are key, general statements make it look like you read to much from the steam forums and are jumping on the band wagon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

apparently a ms service stops your packets quite a bit, some games override it IMO, while others dont it seems.<br>

hmm yea the game sucks donkey balls.  Maps are too small and spawns are extremely retarded.  I get more kills/deaths from spawn camping than from actually playing the game.<br>

Yeah I changed it because the servers feel like dog crap.  Just like WaW.  At game launch they were barely feeding you a 56k connection.<br>
<br>
It's the same as DM - you would like optimal packets/registry.  That is all.  Now if only I could alias rates to weapons.....  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>
<br>
Don't see any dumbed down GFX settings in that post...<br>
<br>
Game overall though feels great.  I haven't noticed any improvement with the 2nd patch, but the 1st patch made the game feel faster/smoother.  <br>
<br>
I was just fortunate and didn't experience any of those FPS drops / high CPU usage as many seemed to have incurred from day 1.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I just logged in now and saw this but its over wouldnt have minded playing it for the lolz.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>DevPick Dec 3-5: TactiQuake<br>
<br>
    This week's DevPick is another... interesting spin on weapon balance that we're calling TactiQuake. Here's a rundown of the main changes.<br>
<br>
        * Machinegun Ironsights: Crouch while firing the machinegun to greatly increase accuracy.<br>
        * Players spawn with all weapons in CTF.<br>
        * Machinegun and Railgun have headshots that do 3x damage.<br>
        * No ammo, weapons, or powerups will spawn on the map.<br>
        * Falling damage and self damage in CA<br>
        * Velocity dampening has been applied to movement and crouch speed.<br>
        * Gauntlet: will do 250 damage on hit.<br>
        * Machinegun: 20 damage per shot, 60 damage per headshot.<br>
        * Grenade Launcher: Splash radius increased to 300, reload time reduced to 1 second.<br>
        * Rocket Launcher: Splash radius increased to 300, reload time reduced to 1.5 seconds, damage per rocket is 300.<br>
        * Lightning Gun: Damage increased to 15, speed decreased to 200ms, lightning gun cripple effect dramatically increased.<br>
        * Railgun: 120 damage, 4 second reload. 360 damage per headshot.<br>
        * Plasma Gun: Reload speed decreased to 200ms, splash radius increased to 64 units.<br>
<br>
<br>
    For the most authentic experience, we recommend lowering your cg_fov to 80! Have a great weekend everyone!

Pub scene is dead no matter what....<br>
<br>
The only thing that matters is that the competitive crowd can play the game they want, when they want, and the way they want it.<br>
<br>
Everyone needs to face it Valve never has been here for us and never will, the only reason this update even happened is so they can<br>
make all their games mac compatible. Now that this has happened and the kids can run around smg'ing each other and throwing toilets ect. on the mac, mission accomplished let's go work on TF2 and maybe some CS:S here and there.<br>
<br>
I've had such a personal problem with players of this game who have been here since inception, and have complained about this or that but when<br>
some one brings a mod out that addresses every this and that no one will support it, no one plays it. Why? <br>
Who the hell cares about a pub full of randoms who really don't give us the challenge we desire in the first place...<br>
<br>
eFPS if it used this mod could be the reason to change this, if lazy ass people could just be forced to download this mod, run servers and truly give this mod a chance, you all might just find out<br>
that there is nothing to complain about anymore and the game plays great just the way we want it hrrrrmmmm........and if something did come up it could be addressed in a timely manor.<br>
<br>
Time will tell what happens here, I still want to play this game the way I like it and when Valve does nothing to change this current state of the game, it will be no surprise to me anyway...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The point is, why the fuck do we have to play a mod in the first place? No wonder people don't want to install a mod to just play the fucking game...It's like surrendering to Valve.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I don't see what the big deal is with just playing the mod for scrims and using regular hl2dm for pubs. Since when did we ever did we care about pubs. I am more than happy to put up with a couple of bugs here or there when playing pubs but when its a scrim or a war I don't want annoying bugs and balance issues ruining my game simple as. I have heard the counter argument that peeps want to play same game they play on pubs on scrims. But there is not much of a difference between the new update and OB mod it just that the mod would be far better for scrims.<br>
<br>
Then we have the so called disconnect between new players and long timers of the game. In what way would there be a disconnect it already there, we PW our servers and kick out spectators when ever we have a war. What is difference? answer is none. As well if we are playing regular hl2dm for pubs they will see us and fear us still and may get involved in leagues and start playing ob mod for scrims. Players are not new to the idea of using mods for competitive play, look at COD4 with pro mod its still doing pretty well for it self actually from what I see its doing better than tf2.<br>
<br>
But the best solution would be sub zero to release OB and have valve completely rip it off and apply it to hl2dm to the next update then everyone would be happy. The lazy, The bold, The purist then may be we can all have nice things.<br>

yes. that's why they're charging money for it now. It's a classic marketing scheme where you build up a product, price it, promote it while secretly intending to destroy it.<br>

<br>
A terrible update was the reason the STA moved over to hl2dm-pro for a while.  If it wasn't for pro screwing up vanilla hl2dm option I'm pretty sure we would still be using hl2dm-pro.  Sub's OB mod sounds like a great idea for competitive play.  Although I bet hl2dm will get one more half ass'd fix from valve at some point so sub has a chance to get the competitive players to join his mod.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

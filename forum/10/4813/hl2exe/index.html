	<div class="content">Okay Im posting here about this since the general consensus a while back was that everyone basically only looks at the Cafeteria now-a-days.<br>
<br>
Ever since I installed Windows 7 about 3 or so months ago and reinstalled what games and programs I currently play, Ive had one issue. The hl2.exe has stopped working. Now from what Ive read online this is apparently tied in with other steam games also, but Ive been fine running everything else. I actually haven't reinstalled TF2 or L4D or anything like that, but I heavily doubt Id have a problem playing it. Ive been playing some CODMW2 and have absolutely no issues playing it, where as I had issues with crashes when I was running Vista before hand with CODMW2. <br>
<br>
Is there any solution, or a general error with this, or is it just one of those random things that will fix itself until maybe a reformat does the trick?<br>
<br>
I have to point out that the game crashes when I start up the game, like right when its supposed to give you the HL2:DM menu, it crashes before any buttons come up. Also on a rare occasion HL2:DM will work, but then after I exit and try to restart HL2:DM it stops working again.<br>
<br>
Ive tried dling new drivers. Actually I got the newest ones yesterday. <br>
- tried deleting the cache and reinstalling. <br>
- tried verifying and defragmenting the cache.<br>
- I read somewhere that in game steam friends could cause issues so I turned that off, it worked for one start up and then it stopped working again after I closed the game and tried starting up again. (I think it was a random startup)<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help you guys can offer. I'm going to try a few more things today, but unless this topic has been covered before and Ive forgotten, Im almost completely out of ideas...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If so, clean out the driver and try an older driver and dl just the display driver, delete control panel.<br>
See if that helps.<br>
There is a problem with some Steam games and the newest Nvidia driver and control panel.<br>
L4D2 would do the same thing.<br>

	<div class="content">there is something wonky with hl2.exe that gives me fits too.  im running xp and my issues are a bit different than yours.  i cant get hl2.exe to quti.  i usually have to go into taskmanager and kill the process.  and often when i crash, i cant get back into the game, i get a message that only one instance of hl2 can be run at a time... even though its not running because it crashed.  so i have to kill the process then restart.  its annoying.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When I first installed win7 (32 bit) hl2dm worked fine.  It didnt feel the same, though, felt way worse, so I just decided to dual boot.  When I got the dual boot going, hl2dm all of a sudden work on dm lol.  Out of perplexion, I investigated.  Tried compatibility mode and all kinds of things, even downloaded the xp virtual machine from windows.  None of that worked, so I just stopped caring</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We have no intentions of testing any anti-cheat software for kitten or anyone else for that matter. Kitten, I haven't been flaming the KAT clan, so don't start to flaming my clan. I will continue to stay out of the bullshit that is going on. Any KAT players who read this will now know that kitten is a spiteful person who is deceitful and continues to try to get back at me for leaving his clan. I left KAT because you wouldn't help your players. Now your helping your players earn a scum reputation for being part of a cult based clan who is selfish, demeaning and has no morals whatsoever. Any of you players still loyal to KAT are FOOLS. Open your friggin eyes and just walk away. If you just look around you and see all the players who have left KAT, you will see that is the right decision for you also. If you KAT players continue to follow the misguidance of kitten and alpha, you will continue to be plastered as IDIOTS. Your choice. Follow your leaders blindly like you are doing, or leave and get yourself into a real respectful clan where you have a chance of learning to be a better player and person.

     As with any new software from any company. Never purchase it when it first comes out. If it is legitamate software, let someone else try it out first. Get the bugs out and then look at it. This company is most likely a bogus company, meaning it is a scam to get your money. I wouldn't waste your time or money on it. If it was real then the cpl leagure (stillaround?) or the cal league would be the best places to test it. Or any other professional league. If this new software is real and starts banning players from the HL2DM community without concreate evidence, then I'm sure Steam will have something to say about it. Stay clear of this software, get a refund if you have already paid for it. If nothing else, check out the company more before buying. Good luck and be careful. kbaxter1<br>

<br>
Why are you so interested in this product anyways, you have nothing to hide, you're not cheaters....right?....or are you?<br>
<br>
At worst this is a bogus fraud scam that you have so wisely avoided, and you should have it sounds like it is priced high enough so you wouldn't buy it anyways, LOL, $599 US! <br>

<br>
No one has been ripped off from this, right?<br>
<br>
But now that I have your attention, you have someone in your midst who has been ripping players off, and yes there is proof of that.  That ass clown called Snipe-it was charging $25us/mth to each admin for game server/admin privileges and there were 10 admins so 10 x 25 = $250 total, and only paying $25 for the server...so the scammer was scamming $225 off his team...what a scammer!

First off theres nothing to worry about either way, the worst that could happen is you get banned from some noob servers for being incorrectly identified. Since there are so many HL2DMU affiliated clans and servers, I doubt we are gonna be running out of places to play anytime soon, and anyone dumb enough to buy something like this...well you 599.00 would be better off spent on some anti paranoia meds as well as some private training to get better at this game.<br>
<br>
To the peps looking to hack the site, web hosts quti associating log in pages directly to the sites IP along time ago, to prevent the exact type of brute force attacks you are talking about doing to get in. Nowadays the web hosts use a central log in page that all clients use to access their control panel, and yes almost everyone uses FTP to access their sites instead of the control panel. Even the FTP IP used to gain access is going to be different than the sites IP, so yeah its not easy to hack a site anymore.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hypocrisy at it's finest.<br>
<br>
You also seem to be having a problem understanding the concept of a PUBLIC forum. Snipe-it is not a Board Member and is not involved in running this site, he is a just a registered user. People are free to voice their opinion here, that is what dmu is all about, freedom of speech. When things get out of hand we step in (note the deletion of other threads concerning your clan).<br>
<br>
Had you joined us here as part of the wider HL2DM community you may have earned some respect, but you continue to isolate yourself from the community and act like you have something special that we all want, with your "50K unique visitors". :roll: <br>
<br>
I strongly recommend you read the mission and objectives of this site before you continue calling us a flamer site, and try really hard to grasp the concept of this being a public forum with registered users who are entitled to express their opinion as much as we can possibly allow.<br>
<br>
Having said all that, welcome to the site and enjoy your stay. You are welcome to defend your clan and your actions here, but please try to keep it clean and flame free. I am saying this especially due to the nature of your history with Snipe, anything you have to say to each other should be done in private channel and not here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

These links are to a bogus website set up by vlad, under the direction of kitten and alpha to try to convince you that they are using anti-cheat software to detect and ban players who they want off of the KAT servers. They are now trying to drag me and my clan into their mess and trying to discredit me and my clan. This shows the true colors of your leaders. If this doesn't open your eyes, then you all deserve each other. But by staying in KAT, as very few of you are, is making you look like the fools. <br>
 <br>
This link talks about the bogus software. I know this info has been posted on your forum by kitten to try to continue to decieve you:<br>

This link was added to try to pull [IWU] into the conflict. None of this info is true:<br>

You must also notice that on this post it says who doesn't own this business. Vlad obviously doesn't mention himself, even though he is still a part of the KAT clan:<br>

This was a response to a posting I made in their guestbook. Notice that my post was deleted and the response to my posting was posted by vlad (steven barclay is vlad). I know this for a fact because the exact wording "I don't know what you malfunction is, but i suggest you seek medical advice for your condition.Get well soon.." was what vlad e-mailed to me back when I left KAT. Any legitimate business would never degrade a potential customer and would know how to spell:<br>

Now I really don't care weather you stay in KAT or not. It's always your choice, but I felt you needed to know what is going on out here in the Half-Life 2 Deathmatch Community. I still consider all of you my friends, but I won't put up with ANYONE trying to discredit me and my clan. Hope to see you in game in the future. Obviously, not on KAT servers because I'm still banned from your servers. You (including kitten, alpha &amp; vlad) are always welcome on our servers. Take care, kbaxter1</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

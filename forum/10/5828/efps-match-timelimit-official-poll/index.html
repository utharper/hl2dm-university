	<div class="content">Basically, on a environment like lostvillage, it's very possible for teams to get a lead of about 10 frags and then be dicks (like Nutri-Grain and myself) and coordinate gay-ass hiding around the map. <br>
That issue is pretty much isolated to LV, but could pop up on new environments in the future. <br>
15 min also allows for a lot of time-saving if you have to go to 3 rounds, and after this tournament, tie-breaking rounds will happen quite a bit. <br>
30min : 45min to do a match as opposed to 40min : 1hour  <br>
<br>
This is a amateur league and most of us will have class or a job or both in most cases; time is money, son. <br>
I am fairly certain that it was either Cyn or $W that established a 20 min standard, and why was it a good idea then or now? <br>
<br>
Pretty sure that 'rule' was just the result of a prerogative, and it got crammed down the player's throat for league after league without people asking - or being disallowed from asking - "why?" <br>
Just because it is an "established" precedent does not mean its good or can't be better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That was so *$(%)@(*)(ing annoying for CTF.<br>
<br>
"Okay no one move."<br>
<br>
"'Kay we're all here, start in 5 4 3 2 1 GO."<br>
<br>
As soon as you move out to 2fort battlements, you see like 3 barrels on the bridge before you even see anyone else outside (cause I'm the only one who knew how to bhop of the CTF players hur hur hur). Seriously, WTF? And we restarted like 3 times and someone did some dumb nonsense every time. So we just said #%() it and went.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

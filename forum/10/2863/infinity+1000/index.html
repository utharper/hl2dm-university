	<div class="content">I feel for you. Try installing an HP printer!  I replace the ink and it tells me ink is low, all the time. Then it spams a message box on how to purchase ink from HP.<br>
I delete the offending process and an HP solution center tries to reinstall.<br>
When my ex bought an HP PC, i had to reformat the whole thing because of all the crapware on it. Backweb lite, an updater for new drivers i don't even need was crashing everything.<br>

I'm kind of ticked that they released CS4 so quickly though. I finally took a CS3 class and out comes CS4. From what I've heard it only looks prettier and something with photoshop 3d editing or whatnot. Not worth it imho. Not until I see something that blows my mind.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just lucky that Adobe products work well for me on my PC. O__o;</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I wasn't happy with my G7 wireless mouse so I sent them an email. It's past warranty, but they're replacing it for me with a new <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/devices/5092" class="postlink">G9x</a> for free. Didn't even ask for my receipt.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Once you get it you will see what I mean the side buttons are just not crisp. They work most of the time but every so often you are going to miss it. Remember most of the gamers out there play real simple games like CS or BF where they do not need to be fast with alot of different buttons so they have no idea. These are the same people who have never figured out about nkey override. Even quake just has a very limited number of buttons you need to press so there is no need for side buttons. But in games like HL2DM they are very useful. Then again maybe your particular config does not use them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks for the input Fearsome. I haven't had a chance to try out either mouse. They haven't shipped my mouse yet, so I'll just go on the safe side and ask them to change it. Looking at the side buttons on the G500 they still look pretty small though. I wish they would have just kept it like the G5/mx518.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yea cheese if those logitechs don't work out for ya, I'd give razer a try... I bought a Deathadder as soon as it came out and after nearly 3 years of use finally upgraded to a imperator because the old da had barely any resistance left in the clickers... Still works fine tho... Side buttons are great on both mice</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I knwo why this is, its to do with the grip which has a "button" that presses the button ont he actual mouse itself however my G9 side buttons wrok fine and have done for 2+ years, there is a little bit of play and I mean about 0.5mm, maybe thats your isse I don't know.<br>
I think I am pretty easy on mice compared to alot of people I read about, they wear them out in a matter of months maybe they just game more than me?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
here's a diff one that does the same thing but, i prefer the first one because it only changes the mouse ports the 2nd link changes all the ports<br>

	<div class="content">it's about Mike, it's about P!ke, it's about us, and....it's about time.<br>
<br>
Frank and i were talking tonight about an EE get together this summer.  but its gonna be more than that.  its gonna be a hl2dm get together.  a tribute to Mike and P!ke. 3,4,or 5 days of fun in the sun.  VA beach.  this is soooo preliminary, just to spark interest and see if there is any.  the plan is......to book out rooms at a hotel at VA beach and just have a great time together. all of us, new and old.  shootin the shit, drinkin some beers, smoking some....what ever.   now, there is a LAN center there, golf courses and all hotels have rooms for meetings.  sooo.  there will be 3 tournies.  a golf outing, a poker tourny, and a gaming tourney of some sort.  none are manditory to participate, only if you want.  if you do decide to play in one or all 3, half of your entry fee will go to Mike and P!ke's families.  if this is something that looks like it will happen we can start to look for ppl to donate prizes from their business'.  we can have teeshirts and hats made up for the event, plus a huge BBQ one night.  i know money is tight for everybody but if we plan ahead of time we can get group discounts, car pools, etc.   of course, there is no way frank and i can do this alone, so if we get interest we will be looking for a comittee to lead this up.   sooooo.......what say you hl2dm community?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As for college, that depends some may depending on their schedule, cost and location/time it takes to get there.  If you did Fri-Mon of Columbus Day weekend to might be possible to get a bunch of peeps there.  The question is where would be relatively inexpensive, have an airport nearby with convenient transportation for non drivers plus the other things you are looking for activitywise.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Oct 11 2010  = Canadian Thanksgiving and it also happens to be the observed day for U.S. Columbus day<br>
<br>
<br>
People are probably going to have to take time off from work/school no matter when you have it. No offense to our Canadian friends but I think most ppl here are in the U.S.?  If it coincides with a 3 day weekend its less time you have to take off from work/school.  All other 3 day weekends (Memorial day, Labor day, July 4th etc) are all pretty much U.S. holidays or big family holidays and the chances of getting people there are small.  Also July/August is big for family vacations so again less chance for people able to get to this.  If you are tryng to get the most people there, these are things you need to consider.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I wondered how long it would be before he admitted that Replicant was an alias. <br>
<br>
And yeah we knew but as far as I know only 3 of us were aware of it for most of the time.   Server logs dont lie and you logged onto my server with both names.  <br>
<br>
I have to say one thing though, as Replicant you did get quite a bit more acceptance from the community, which was something that bothered you as Grape.<br>
I dont think you have to give up on DM or the DMU, but maybe take account of what your experiment showed and learn from that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You're right, I wasn't gonna let anyone know it was Grape unless he got out of line, but as Replicant he was an alright kid.<br>

	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">I am sorry you feel the way you feel grape, what everyone is saying is basically true, as Replicant you seem to behave better then Grape would come out. I know you think I am the one who let the cat out of the bag, when I told you VALAR figured it out on his own, I wasn't lying, by then your Grape side was starting to really show.<br>
<br>
I was fine with you until I came in that night and you were using your favorite names on a noob on my server, grant it he was annoying so he got banned, but you were so out of hand. Then the next day I received maybe 30 IM's from you, that is just truly obsessive compulsive.<br>
<br>
You can take this as lesson learned, you did very well in the begining as Rep, you were polite and fun, is that so hard for you to be? As you got more comfortable though you let your guard down, that was the failure. Team V would have been happy to work with you as Rep, as we had started to, but as I mentioned to you the Term Veracity means truthfulness.. you should try being truthful, to yourself and others.<br>
<br>
Good luck either way, I hope you can figure out how to be social without being caustic.<br>

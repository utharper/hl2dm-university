</div></blockquote>

Oh me I can answer this one, I have tried in HL1 to code a projectile which can hurt its owner and its very hard to do right with the tools given. Even after we thought we had it right sometimes it would just glitch out and explode in your face. Basically in hl2dm you would probably see owners getting vaporized when they shot the ball. And then you would be even more mad. <br>
<br>
As for those other games you listed. Haha HL2DM Source? Your kidding right thats buggier and crappier then this one. HLDM is the cleanest of them but you are bound to die from your own tau cannon due to bugs too and don't get me started on the various other nukes. You probably don't play those games as much or at the level you do here cause there is plenty of crap with them too. Most of your problems are just the reality of valves client side prediction and you got all that same exact crap in all the other games you listed. Shotgun random damage as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why do you respawn with 2 handgrenades?</div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why do you respawn with a Gravity Gun?
</div></blockquote>
because those two things are the only things in this god loving game that will save u ass when u respawn in front of someone that does have something else than a pee shotter.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why does the RPG makes so much splash damage if it is supposed to be a hit weapon?</div></blockquote>
as said already those things in RL can really f U up even if they miss off a foot so why not here smg nads do the same only difference is that the rpg explosion can be more controlled and directed.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Why do you have 3 SLAMs when you pick one down from the ground?</div></blockquote>
emm don't care hardly use it. I guess it so that the user will have enuff to surround a spawn point where the only way out is death  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"> 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Why do Combine Balls chase you?</div></blockquote>
emm yea that does get on my nerves don't really understand why they track may bethey are attracted to matter or have a mind of its own that wants to take U out before its life ends. But I think the orb will be a more skilled weapon if it did not track. damn thing always kills me on the last orb bounce even when my mind calculates the gegertory and always get it wrong because the damn thing can come in at 45 degrees and instead of coming out off a bounce of 90 degrees adjsent to it bounces off 15 degrees right towards me. Better if it was like crossbow where u can be more calculated with your shot making it more of a skilled weapon than sometimes end like lottery where where your likely to win. 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why do Combine Balls do not kill their owner?</div></blockquote>
yep another random thing to add to the game that will make it better? . Trust me it can be even more enoying if it could.  
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why are physics random?</div></blockquote>
emm yea really strange  may be because RL physics are random like rolling a dice. 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why is it random the damage produced by the shotgun?</div></blockquote>
may be its better that way forcing u to work with the physics of how a rl shotgun works. Like if u have a shotgun u work your self closer to your opponent or draw them in to do bigger damage to them. Also it does require aim to make sure the u aim dead center and on the sweet point for max damage. Ohh RL is random why have u not uninstalled that?  
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why can't I set my server to 100Tick if I want to?</div></blockquote>
they are out there RaW has some be we considering changing them to 66 tick because the grenade timing is off and for me it feels strange. Also elevators kill U they don't like 100 tick and so does physics.  
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why in the hell does CAL turn off the friendlyfire? This incentivates the game to make more spam, instead of checking out there if there is a teammate you just go throwing explosives and cballs everywhere.</div></blockquote>
Here in Europe we play FF on don't know who decided this but i guess we are better off because it forces us to use communication thro out the whole game in order to win. But judging how u reacted to the rest of the stuff in this game u will not like it imagine u got a got couple of kills just to have your team m8 blow u up and ruin your kill ratio. 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Enough is enough, I just uninstalled it. But I still got my HLDM, HLDMS and HL2DM Pro installed.</div></blockquote>
hl2dm is the most active ones of those lot GL with that. 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I think everybody should uninstall HL2DM from their Steam Games and turn off all the servers. Lets get on strike, I'm so damn tired of the randomness of this game, even when I see blood I don't know if I had hit or not. For christ sakes, why on hell are physics so random?

Sorry maybe i am wrong but when i here people complain about 'randomness' all i can think it means is 'this person should have never killed me because i am better then them'   That's what drove Rhideon crazy enough to drive him into the biggest Wow binge ever.  In Hl2dm Deaths are meant to be fast and ya sometimes can be easy.<br>

RPG is not meant to blow people, RPG is meant to neutralize choppers/trucks/jeeps/tanks/whatever but never soldiers, its splash is shitty. For good examples of RPG against units you can see Black Hawk Down, it kills you only if it really hits you, like a bullet. Or an anti-personal mine in your foot lol. Not 5m behind you.<br>

Anyways, I don't think this game is unbalanced..in a 1v1, both players have chances to capture control points in a map first, and even if you don't usually you can take them out and take over the control point for your own little reign.<br>

	<div class="content">IMO you shouldn't respawn with 2 grenades and RPG should produce less splashdamage but make it a sure kill when hitting the enemy, doesn't matter if he has 100/200. And cballs should kill their owner. FF should be activated on any TDM match and respawning with a SMG that you can easily collect smg1_nades is shitty for me.<br>
<br>
The spirit of HL1 is the longjump and taucannon, you don't respawn with any of both.<br>
<br>
I really like to have many ways of making instant kills but not to be killed by an unnamed from the back with a cball/lost grenade/prop/RPG/etc.<br>
<br>
And believe it or not, Internet sux for catching cballs/grenades of advanced players with GravGun.<br>
<br>
PS: I don't care if Valve isn't going to fix it if we go on a strike, because I know they are not going to do it either if we continue playing.<br>
<br>
Did you notice that 80-90% of players and servers are co-op or lowgrav killbox? They don't care about us, and believe me, I'm not going to be an stupid playing an abandoned game that is broken and they don't have any plans at all in fixing it because they know they won't receive any financial profit.<br>

In tsgk i die by the unnamed random smg spray more then any other weapon.  But i truck on, yes the pub land is pretty much a waste land by i pay my 25 bucks a month so i can have a nice place to play, and maybe bring back some thunder that is hl2dm.  I wish some of you LSD guys would maybe find a NA team to play with the high ping i would think that would be better then all.  But you would lose out with your friends you have played with for so long.<br>
<br>
Only got to play 1 match against you guys, and it was fun.  I am sure we got a few kills caused by lag alone and that sucks.  I wish we had a middle ground as in a Mexican server to use where both would get 70-80 ping but this doesn't seem like it will happen.<br>
<br>
strike is a bad idea, we need to bring ppl into the game, it will be updated but like zeta it will be a polish not fix everything because you don't like one thing or another.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">hl2dm was the first ever online multi-player game I've owned and yes I may get sick of it at times but because it's a different playing experience each time I continue to play and not uninstall it or sell my steam account. Bugs be bugs and hopefully in the near future if enough ppl complain they will fix the game's flaws. Remember bugs affect all players so don't get frustrated if one bites you! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"> <br>
<br>
I really don't find many other games interesting atm I've tried to play games like hellgate london but they bore the sh*t outta me :/ Yet hl2dm manages to not suck completely and remains replayable. <br>
<br>
And the g-gun is the bestest/only defense to orbs other than grabbing your tail and running. W/ nuff practice your deflecting/catching skills will come natural ;p<br>
<br>
Remember as ppl here have said, play this game for fun and try to have fun playing and don't let the flaws and imperfections get to you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

now I have 80-90 in the server of my country, 100 until even 150 on brasilian servers...<br>
Can't play on other places, it seriously sucks.<br>

lemme ask him a question in public, would you mind telling us how many times you unninstalled this game, same as css? there we have the answer <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

	<div class="content">Yeah tons of times. But that was last year, and tell me how active I had been this year, lol. I been travelling a lot and this Sunday I'm leaving to Mendoza (Los Andes <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">) for a week. Plus I am studying and doing some other activities. <br>
<br>
I got really tired of this game as I said. The few times I played this game was in a local server with 30-40ms and with a few of friends. And it was less than 1 hour and we were just kidding, not playing serious.<br>
<br>
And yes, my location is a big factor of my anger. I hate not being able to play in the States with a decent latency. Argentina's ISP routing definitively sucks, first we go all around Europe and then to NA. And if I want to play in Brazil I must go all over Europe, then NA and then I came down to Brazil resulting in a 400ms latency. Same for Chile.<br>

Oh me I can answer this one, I have tried in HL1 to code a projectile which can hurt its owner and its very hard to do right with the tools given. Even after we thought we had it right sometimes it would just glitch out and explode in your face. Basically in hl2dm you would probably see owners getting vaporized when they shot the ball. And then you would be even more mad. <br>
<br>
As for those other games you listed. Haha HL2DM Source? Your kidding right thats buggier and crappier then this one. HLDM is the cleanest of them but you are bound to die from your own tau cannon due to bugs too and don't get me started on the various other nukes. You probably don't play those games as much or at the level you do here cause there is plenty of crap with them too. Most of your problems are just the reality of valves client side prediction and you got all that same exact crap in all the other games you listed. Shotgun random damage as well.</div></blockquote>

In hl2ctf, you can die from your own orbs. I've never had a problem with them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Our point is the game is not broken rather you just have a different opinion of how it should work. I played HLDM competitively and I can tell you that that game was hell on spawners only having a pistol and crowbar against a guy who can move 100x as fast as you and sweep the entire map in 5 seconds to spawn kill you again. Like I said I don't think you played that game competitively if you did when good people still played it you would see why giving spawners a bunch of weapons to start is much better on them then in hldm. And all of those games have shotguns with most likely the exact same code as this one they are all valve games with the same crappy netcode and same random generators for bullet spread. <br>
<br>
As far as FF in leagues it was voted on and turned down we can vote again if you like, I was actually for FF on but the vast majority of players in the Americas do not want it. As for spam its controlled by the map and some weapons have to be more powerful then others that gives the game a tactical level when people want to go get a certain weapon. If some guy shoots you in the back so what thats the nature of any dm game and will happen to you plenty in the ones you listed too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

thats not a bug the tau cannon bounces off walls if at the right angle and if its too thick so if you are too close it hits you.<br>
It is possible to code the ball killing thee owner just lookat dmpro or HL2CTF.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

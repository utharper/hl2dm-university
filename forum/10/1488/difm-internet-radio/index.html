	<div class="content">This topic is for all the techno addicts that frequent this site, if you haven't stumble upon this site <a href="http://www.di.fm/" class="postlink">http://www.di.fm/</a> already here is an official introduction. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  I just want to share this site with everyone because it is simply awesome.   This site started out for the most part as purely a hub for techno and its MANY forms and variations.  It is partnered with sky.fm to offer just about all the other genres you could want, they have goapsy trance to free jazz to salsa to classical to world music.  <br>
<br>
I just recently started to get fervently addicted to this site again, due to my new sound setup which makes the listening experience down right euphoric.  Di.fm is the best place I have found for extremely high quality, diverse, internet radio.  The variety and quality of tracks in their trance, goapsy trance and chillout sections have kept me listening for years now.   All of their free streams are offered in variable bandwidths, but I would suggest the 96kb because the lesser bandwidth streams experience a lot of loss in quality .  Tune in and enjoy, I certainly have.    <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
Edit:  I can't believe I almost forgot, they also host shows on most of their channels, highlighting the music of a certain dj or collaborators.  Some shows are even live performances being put on by the DJ themselves, which is just outstanding as you could imagine.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No it just opens up the recorder and you record as you please. you can choose to record at different speeds other than the usual 192 kbps which is handy for me if I want to use some of this music for a DJ mix.  If you want to record multiple tracks you would have to stop and start the recordings manually. Or just record a whole stream and separate it yourself in some sound software.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

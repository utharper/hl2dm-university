	<div class="content">I want the dm community to back the campaign and get Pig Popper back at what he does best and start mapping again.<br>
I know hes been into Battlefield 2 these days but his talent is wasted, i want him to make a map for the summer competition, so pls help get this sucker back in business.<br>
The more ppl who back this the better the chance he'll come back...plus this game needs mappers like him to sustain this awesome game.<br>
Heres the link to back the campaign.....cheers<br>

	<div class="content">PigPopper is a solid, good mapper. I gotta agree though if the man is finding his own and success in mapping for a new game let him be. He probably felt underappreciated in this community which makes sense because at least in the US side we dont use or like his maps for competitive play.<br>

I remember (so do you) when a lone killbox player designed his first competitive map and the US crowd gave near perfect 10's across the board...<br>

Meekle and me both wondered if there would be bias and there was none.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The EU competitive side is different? Clans in CU are still using the original lockdown, dm_underpass, dm_octagon, resident_r1 and dm_frenzy lol.<br>
<br>
If anything our map rotation of dm_caverns_r1, dm_airfusion, mileau, dm_lockdown_r5 and the lone exception of lostvillage was technically newer then most of the CU maps being used by clans.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">pig does have a bunch of good maps but we dont take the time to play in them because we are too used to the ones that we already know. I think a lot of us support your move rip but here in the US side the majority of players hardly hear of the newer maps. Another reason pig left is obviously the size of the community , now that there arent as many players around it would be of greater benefit to him going to a newer game and get satisfied.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

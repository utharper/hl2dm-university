	<div class="content">I don't know where you see that we were stacked... we had like 4 players lol... the only guys that were left was me, Zman, tiggy, book, rachkir. that's 5, I don't know how 5 players is a stacked team lol, since there is one division that is 4v4, we only had one back up.<br>
<br>
But I also understand what you mean by good players joining weaker teams to make them like competition more. But the thing with that, for me at least, is that, I've taught so many people strats and techniques and stuff so many times over and over, and each time when I was finished training them and they were good, they joined a random clan and never talked to me again. So I just gave up teaching people that I don't know because it didn't bring anything to me except the fact that I like teaching people to make them better.<br>
<br>
So, thats for me again, I just don't feel like joining a weaker clan or a clan that still doesn't have all their strats and stuff together, because then I will have to teach them all of it over again, and waste my time on that when after no one will really care anyways ya know. That's one of the reasons I don't want to join a weaker clan, not because I want to win at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

these are peops ive seen bearing the flas tag.  and i dont think u shud do anything u dont want to. i.e. join a team who needs to improve. by stacked i ment that there wasnt anyone in flas who could not rape face. they were allllll really good. as far as u being the generous professor of dm to only have his pupils run away, it is a sad story that someone as good as you is put off on teaching. this games future is grim indeed. but don worry its k. u and vdus and sw and ewr  and 911 (forgetting anyone?) can have fun playin eachother till the end of time cause no one else can compete.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

we're sorry if nobody can beat us, we really really are. <br>
<br>
We contribute in many ways, EE and ewR together have over 5 servers, some of which are pubs.  We are in both CAL and Warzone, and EE is still actively recruiting members no matter what skill they are.  ewR was a team formed for fun.  After seeing how billy and I play, rico and nino decided it'd be a cool idea to join wrw and EE to make a joint team for CAL, just to see how well we would do.  Once people started seeing how good we were, everyone was on our ass.  "OMG WE CAME OUTTA NO WHERE, MUST BE HACKS, and so on..."  We still scrim whoever wants to scrim us, and we still help the community.  We just don't tend to be nice to people that talked shit to us first.  If you start shit with ewR, don't expect to just sit back, lol, and get away with it.  We will cause more shit than you, and you will lose in the end.  We started ewR with the best intentions, and even though some of you think that we're just a bunch of assholes that like to talk shit and rape the hl2dm community, we are a litttttle bit more than that.  We still have some people that like us, and those are the people that didn't start anything with ewR first.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, Rico is the master of U posts, and paradox needs to take a chill pill.</div></blockquote>

i'm riled up too grain.  what i read about fairly frequently is how the skilled teams/clans don't have much fun playing against less skilled players.  so what was the purpose?  prior to that little sham, i had no problem playing ewr, so i'd get my ass beat... no biggie.  its a chance to observe and learn.<br>
<br>
i think i understand now why ewr may have trouble getting scrims.  it's not the skill at all.  at least not in my book.  and its a shame.  because individually, i like you all, and EE too.  and i stand to learn a lot from every smack down any of you put on me.  but i'll pass from now on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

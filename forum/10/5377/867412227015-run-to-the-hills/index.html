	<div class="content">Ok was someone from here trolling me hardcore, or have I found the gayest server in existence.<br>
<br>
I joined last night, every other player, I can only assume they were admins, spawned with more than 4 smgs nades, could track me through walls and never seemed to die. They all used mic chat and sounded like inbred fuckwits, (no offence to anyone from the southern states, but that accent is fucking atrocious). They kicked me when I started to give them abuse. I just want to know has anyone else run across this collection of human vermin or am I alone? picture very much related</div>

I think a few of them turn their god mode on and off.  When i called them out on it, they just changed my name to cry baby noob and said i sucked.  One main guy, predator i think is his name, has a large headcrab model he plays as and can basically fly and go thru walls as he pleases. i have never been able to kill these fucktards, even with full clip direct rpg hits.

The fuck is wrong with you. I asked had anyone else played there, where did I say I went back to the server. I don't know what vendetta you have against Ireland but quite frankly it's embarrassing.  Have you ever been here? Or are you relying on stereotypes, because if it's stereotypes you want the southern United States are stereotypically known for racism, homophobia and bad dental care. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones, so kindly drink a nice glass of stfu.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

1. I said the accent was horrible you braindead old cunt, that and coupled with the douchebags in question behaviour made me make the inbred fuckwit comment.  Show me a post where I rag on the south without specifically pointing out that I am using stereotypes.  <br>
<br>
2. I started the thread to see if anyone here had run into them you were clearly interested enough to open up the thread and even post in it. What bastions of knowledge are you responsible for on here, what's that none. I thought not. <br>
<br>
3. Examples please, also fucking lol at your obsession with Irish dancing. <br>
<br>
4. I have not had a single filling or rotten tooth. I'm twenty three, but sure go back to the stereotypes. <br>
<br>
5.Treeless, were you walking around with your fingers in your eyes the entire time you were here. <br>
<br>
6. [sarcasm] I can't imagine why anyone would not be friendly towards you [/sarcasm]<br>

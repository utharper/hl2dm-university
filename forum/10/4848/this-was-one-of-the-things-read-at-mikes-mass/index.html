	<div class="content">I remember and love all the memories of you. <br>
From the screams like a girl to all the times you said "Ew"<br>
The Italian shirts that you wore with such pride<br>
Will forever be stamped inside my mind<br>
Smoking was bad, but you didn't stop<br>
Malboro was the way, at 7 dollars a pop<br>
You loved your Pepsi, so tasty and sweet<br>
The sauce and pasta you so enjoyed to eat.<br>
Sugar in your coffee a quarter inch thick<br>
You'd suck that thing down, way too quick.<br>
With all these bad things, you could never part<br>
I expected them to halt your life and your heart.<br>
But that's not what happened, well it did, sort-a<br>
It wasn't your tender heart but a bad Aorta<br>
You left us anyway, unexpected, but quiet<br>
With silly worded memories, of "Yup, Fish, and Kiet!!"<br>
The stories we'll tell, will be never ending<br>
About you, my brother, while my heart is mending<br>
Your gorgeous green eyes so piercing and bright<br>
Will forever be burned in my mind day and night<br>
I will miss you SO much, and all that I see<br>
Is a brother I had that really loved me.<br>
No worries on the girls that treated you bad<br>
They're luck ran out when they lost what they had.<br>
True to Boston Bruins and all the games that had been,<br>
To the Buddha you'd bow in hopes for a win.<br>
Half Life-The game you played round the clock<br>
Warfare Arena, Frank's Hangout &amp; Skull Shock<br>
Learning the tricks, stunts, and jumps so silly<br>
In hopes of attacking and killing Poor Billy.<br>
Another of you there could never ever be<br>
The simple and basic you that the world did see<br>
Now is my time to say goodbye<br>
As I struggle with the reasons you had to die<br>
I hope and pray I will somehow get through<br>
With this heartache I have from losing you.<br>
We will meet again, Mike, and to you I'll find my way<br>
But for now I will love and miss you........and pretend to be OK.<br>
 <br>
RIP Mike<br>
 <br>

	<div class="content">Since I guess this thread is basically refering to me and confused (lawl) here's my 2 cents.<br>
<br>
Quebec is known for it's multicultural background due to the fact that back in the days it the territory belonged to France and then England came and fucked them up. Quebeccers learned English for obvious reasons but kept speaking french. Nowadays people often comehere despite the horrible winter because we are some kind of mixed-up of everything. Other french-speaking countries started to pour in from France to Africa, Haiti etc... And english-only people would come over too because what the hell, most of us speak english aswell. ALSO we're one of the only places left in the world that has a public hospital system, wich means it's included in everyone's taxes (wich is in part why taxes in Quebec are so high) so let's say you fall off your skateboard and crack your knee open, slide your card, your medical files are being updated, no problems. Everyone receives the same medical assistance no matter how money you make in a year (of course there are always private clinics for people who doesnt like to wait) Same for schools, you dont pay a cent until college and college cost from like 1-3K$ maximum<br>
<br>
The reason alot of people are Seaparatist is beauce Quebec and it's people are very Socialist and this mentality reflects in work structures and how people look upon the Army / wars in general.<br>
<br>
The rest of Canada are pretty much way more Patriotic and US-Like since they do not have public hospital, alot of english canadians support war/troops and do not wish to speak french because "there's no use for it" wich here, is considered as a ''ill just stay isolated from the rest of the world ty"<br>
<br>
French canadians tend to be either Super-Patriotic (these usually still curse about the bad englishmen who won the war 7bajillions years ago and spit on learning english, countryside people mostly) Or not patriotic at all since they grew in multicutural environment and you just pretty much feel that you're a resident of the world since in Montreal (wich is the heart of quebec) every countries are represented.<br>
<br>
That's pretty much it, if confused as nothing to add that is hahaha</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well, my heritage is french canadian.  my parents were the first to be born in USA.  i used to go to see my relatives in Canada 3-4 times a summer.  i dont get to go any more cause of work, gas costs...etc.  when i was a child there was no place i wanted to be more then Canada.  my uncle owns a farm there and i used to go help him out in the summer with various duties.  its a beautiful country and i would love to move there some day.  i have been teased most of my life for being of french canadian background but i never cared, im damn proud out it.  quebec city is an amazing place to visit.  montreal as well. ive been there many times for hockey tournaments.  i proudly fly a canadian flag in my gaming room at my house.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, conflict pretty much stated everything. I don't know if Quebec is "better" than all the rest of Canada, but here is what I think. Since here, everything that you would pay in other parts of Canada like, hospitals, school etc. is free here, that is a big advantage for people that don't earn as much money as others in my opinion. Also there are a lot of different nations of people that live here (Africans, Spanish etc.) there isn't as much racism here than in other places, like in some places different nations can't vote, some can't go to school etc. but here everyone can do anything pretty much.<br>
<br>
So in my opinion i think Quebec is "better" than the rest of Canada.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I disagree with to many posters though , permanent markers usually sharpie can be cleaned to almost perfection very quickly with ethanol. It would have taken a guy all of 5 minutes to do it if the xbox cover is not highly porous.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What I find interesting is how the console generation is, they are so much more like fans of a sport. Do you know any PC gamers who really get into it like that. I mean that guy must have done some traveling to pick up those signatures. This is why consoles are destroying PC games. Dark times lay ahead for us thumbing tiny joy sticks on lame consoles with only 10 buttons to use.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Eek a gaming world dominated by consolers...dark times indeed.  There really is no substitute when it comes to a keyboard and mouse, it pwns all console controlers.  I don't think computer gaming will every be in danger of being overshadowed by consoles.  What makes more sense?  Buy something you can only play games on or something you can play games on + do a million other things.  More people today use gaming console than ever before thats true, but more people also have a computer than ever before.  Theres just no doubt in my mind that computers will always be at the forefront of gaming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you mean the <a href="http://www.unseen64.net/wp-content/gallery/half-life-2/hl2proto21.jpg" class="postlink">female assassins</a>, WOW talk about a bad move on Valve's part not including them in the finished game. FYI you can't use them and will most probably get a nice law suit for even downloading the E3 beta.<br>
BTW, for those of you who play Borderlands; the female <em class="text-italics">Lance Assassins</em> are a direct ripoff from Valve's early E3 HL2 beta from 2003 which introduced them. However the whole idea was abandoned and they were taken out of the game for an unknown reason.<br>
<br>
You can get a sneak peek at the <em class="text-italics">Borderlands Female Assassins</em> <a href="http://www.co-optimus.com/article/3485/new-borderlands-dlc-will-feature-enemies-with-more-jetpacks-and-laser-katanas.html" class="postlink"><strong class="text-strong">here</strong></a> at 3:00<br>

I do believe that there are mods that include those models, at least I think there are... Mods that had whole cut chapters of the game, including beta weapons. Flare gun comes to mind...<br>
<br>
Anyway I remember reading that some models were still able to be spawned in game, combine hunter, with SOME ai. <br>
<br>
Of course playing as a combine hunter will be hax and rape.<br>
<br>
I dont remember reading if the female assassins ever made it to 3d model stage though which would make this entire post silly if it never made it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

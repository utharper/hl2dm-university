Hahahaha oh god!  NO LEAN!  Cause that's used so often right?  And I haven't had a problem with ping or hitreg once.  You're trying way too hard to hate this game.</div></blockquote>

Yeah I don't have any of those issues you just said actually... And the lack of lean? I had to adapt with that in cod4. Honestly I have to agree I was a little despairing when I found out there was no lean in this one, but it was something that was added to cod4 and I had to learn to appreciate, none the less hardly any other games out there have lean. Yes, yes, there are plenty out there, but nothing mainstream and nothing I can think of off the top of my head that is worth playing currently. <br>
<br>
For me I have a average ratio, also depending on the map and the strategy I use. On average I'll come out mid rank or top ranked on random pickup servers, although admittedly Ive had some last place rankings too. I'm not saying that as a braggart, but more so as my defense against the poor hit ratio you speak of, I haven't seen it at all. So far I cant really complain though, its been smooth sailing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok so I guess the more you play this game the more accepting you become with all of its shortfalls and maybe thats why some people think its ok, I just have a hard time with it knowing what it could have been.<br>
<br>
@panic this game was made for the 360 and 360 players are used to this kind of bs, so it dosnt bother them.<br>
<br>
@ Nutri I can understand you might be having fun with the game, I even do at times but it just gets bad, really bad at times when you spray 60 rounds at a player right in front of you with a RPD or Scar, AUG or w/e and he manages to run right at you and knife you. This is the hit reg problem I speak of mainly in addition to the random lag which can be the only explanation for this bs as it never happened on the previous COD's on good dedicated servers. There have been hundreds of people complaining about this on the steam forums so it's not just me.<br>
<br>
@Deathangel lean was in all of the previous COD games not just MW1 (even the predecessor medal of honor series) and with the COD series some of the game types are heavily reliant on camping and peaking around corners. To not have it now just destroys the way we learned to play most of the game types. For someone (not saying just you) who has really only played HL2DM a true run and gun game, no lean might seem normal but to me it is not.<br>
<br>
My biggest gripe of all tho absolutely has to be the  locked FOV @ 60 and if you use the work around app to open the console you are risking a VAC ban, so yeah its utter bullshit to have to put up with that.<br>
<br>
P2P matchmaking just can't be considered fair not matter how you look at it. In a server full of equal skilled players I have seen it time and time again proven to be true that the guy hosting has a huge advantage and if you don't belive it alter your mp_cfg to show 10 bars and change the bar value from 100 to 20. You will then start to see the guy with the low ping owning hard everytime, provided he isnt a noob.<br>
<br>
From a post on spuf:<br>
• Navigate to the folder: 'program files\steam\steamapps\common\call of duty modern warfare 2\players' and open the file config_mp.cfg<br>
<br>
• Change scoresping_interval from 100 to 20, and maxbars from 4 to 10 (10 is the max).<br>
<br>
• This means that each of the 10 bars represents 20ms, with full green being 20ms or lower, and 1 red being 200ms or higher.<br>
<br>
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE:<br>
<a href="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6871/ihost.jpg" class="postlink">http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/6871/ihost.jpg</a><br>
<br>
===============================<br>
<br>
The sad truth? You might wanna pound a few beers before you read this:<br>
<br>
• The host is immediately obvious, he's the guy with 0-20 ping (full green).<br>
• I usually connect with about 101-200+ms.<br>
• Most people are connected at 200+ms (3 or less bars on normal cfg settings).<br>
• On regular cfg settings, 4 bars means up to 0-100 ping, 3 bars 101-200, 2 bars 201-300, 1 bar is 301+.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah HL2:DM wasn't my original FPS, I actually grew into it with a little of HL1, but more so I played the Battlefield series and Rainbow Six back when on 56k modems. Ive also played some, but not all of the other Call of Duty and Medal of Honor series, and I get what you are saying, its just not that fundamentally imprinted on my mind to make it a matter of distate for the game. Admittedly I still do think of times where I would rather stick my head out of a window then my whole body, but its something that I am used to with all games of today and so you learn to adapt. The gaming industry is just in general making a pit fall since back before 2006. Id have to say that 2006 was maybe the peak and after the online gaming competition and industry as a whole started to degrade, so did gaming in general. They are focusing more on console players as thats where the revenue is coming from and I honestly cant blame them. They make a game for the money, not for the community, the only time they would change anything is if people stop buying their games. I dont really see that happening anytime soon with how the industry is rolling, so Id have to say although I agree with you, I still stick behind what I said. <br>
<br>
Its a give and take relationship and really they are just giving what the majority wants, and taking away the rest. I cant really see the gaming industry change anytime soon unless there starts to become more adopters of the PC genre again. <br>

Yea and that's the problem I see with games/TV/movies anymore these days.  Cool ideas &amp; change are not what counts anymore, it's selling to the fags that want the same game over &amp; over and slower-than-shit-through-a-funnel gameplay.  I never understood why people would not like a game where you can fly around at 200 mph by just jumping, all the while firing rockets at dudes and shit, or why they would like a fucking joystick that takes 8 hours to go 180 degrees on better than a mouse.<br>
<br>
Look at sit-coms these days, they're all fucking clones of each other with the most fail jokes ever.  How many CSI/law &amp; order clones do we have now?  The newest transformers movie had a meh story and some of the fucking gayest most cliche new characters ever.  Yeah, the action was good, but it was still made for the mainstream; I guess I'm not mainstream.<br>

Not much competitive gaming left tbh. Either you like 1.6/sc or youre stuck playing in retarded kidlet games with all-online leagues, low 4-figure pots if anything and a ton of cheating and unfixed bugs.<br>
<br>
Oh and WoW, if you can choke back the bile long enough to call it competitive (the fact that it does have decent prize pots aside).<br>
<br>
The original cs creator is working on an unofficial sequel, and apparently severity is still in the works, but otherwise i dont see much coming out in the near future thatll change the status quo.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">lol @ severity, honestly I cannot imagine how you can beat Quake 3 CPM or Warsow when it comes to actual competitive, skilled gameplay. May it be movement timing or aim.<br>
<br>
It's probably why it takes them the longest time to simply come out with pictures or trailers or... whatever. If you look at what warsow or q3cpma offers.... really what more would you want (beside a ggun and orb spam) competitive shooters ARE THERE, not alot of people playing it, this title is a joke and will probably never see the day, or when it will no one will give a flying f**k</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not much competitive gaming left tbh. Either you like 1.6/sc or youre stuck playing in retarded kidlet games with all-online leagues, low 4-figure pots if anything and a ton of cheating and unfixed bugs.<br>
<br>
Oh and WoW, if you can choke back the bile long enough to call it competitive (the fact that it does have decent prize pots aside).<br>

Yup. That's what I basically said although apparently I had some typos, because I was in a hurry with my response...<br>
<br>
I basically saw competitive shooters die around 2006 after the FI0S tourney. And we're not talking just CAL league BS here, we're talking all leagues in general. Even the competitive greats like Fata1ty as I previously mentioned aren't being competitive, because there isn't much push for competition anymore. Its just a bunch of pubs and hack accusations no matter what the game is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think what he meant was how to get access to the beta. The beta is open to everyone today for the next 10 or so days. <br>
<br>
How to get the beta explained below.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>PC<br>
If you have already installed our new download service Origin, go to the section “Free games”, where the Battlefield 3 Open Beta will appear for download. You can also head to this product page via the web. If you have not installed Origin yet, it will ask you to do so before proceeding with the download of the Open Beta itself.</div></blockquote>

Also I would  not pre order the digital copy it is a rip off. I found it was £10 cheaper to pre order the hard copy from my local store. Might be different where you guys are. <br>
Plus I don't trust EA as much as Valve.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

hit reg is good<br>
maps are large<br>
graphics good but not amazing<br>
<br>
Things I dont like<br>
orgin<br>
matchmaking system<br>

	<div class="content">They have switched off the ultra setting for the beta so what you should seeing is just high. I don't have a problem with the graphics as they are now it just slightly better than BFBC2. this beta is just for server stress tests and game bug findings.<br>
<br>
As for shotty have not seen any BS from it, behaves like a shotty should behave, one shot kill close range and three shots medium as for long well there is no point. Could change though with a attachment but I have not seen any that changes a shotty into a sniper rifle yet.<br>
<br>
Guns feel right with the recoil and sound. Movement is very fluid.<br>

So far having a good time I really want to get on Caspian Boarder but it near impossible to get on to it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He is right. I set everything to ultra (I have 2 gtx 460s) and the graphics were not that great. I think they are holding back or it is just the map. I feel like they are on par with Bad Company 2. They look quite a bit better getting past the subway and into the actual city though. Might be the lighting in the first area.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

agreed.  at this point it reminds me more of medal of honor then BF.  im actually not as impressed as i thought i would be, but then again, there's no vehicles, jets, etc in this map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, I'm gonna give the graphics a bit more credit they are better than good I will say great but just not amazing.<br>
I guess with a gtx 580 and ultra settings I was expecting a little more, but there likely isn't anything else better atm.<br>
<br>
More than anything I have really come to like the diverse gameplay possible with the larger sized map as well as<br>
the way all the different unlocks like scopes, barrels, sights, kits ect ect affect the power, accuracy, recoil and overall effectiveness of the guns.<br>
With this many configurations possible you really want to try them all and using different set ups will be majorly important for different maps or even just parts of maps.<br>
<br>
Once this game comes out and the other maps and vehicles become available, Im pretty sure short of some small bugs and glitches getting fixed this will be an amazing game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

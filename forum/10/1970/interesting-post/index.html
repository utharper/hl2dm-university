	<div class="content">Well i've pretty much finished everything i have to do for work for the week and was looking for some places to post for some new blood to get exposed to hl2dm and came across this post.....<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.championshipgamingseries.com/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=62250" class="postlink">http://www.championshipgamingseries.com ... c&amp;id=62250</a><br>
<br>
hl2dm didn't get shot down,  q3 is really the only deathmatch game that holds any weight against hl2dm but hl2dm blows q3 out of the water in many areas.  And at least in my opinion can be viewed and have the person watching not get bored out of there minds,  With the right map selection.  Some maps are campy but others for your to move a lot and have lots of action.<br>
<br>
Other places i think we could post as a group to get exposer would be the Cal general forums and on Gotfrag  in the quake forums.  We are the most active Online deathmatch game and other deathmatch games are ripe for the pickings.  Only thing we lack is LAN events and sponsers.  <br>
But for online leagues CAL and sta before that have been long standing, and has been great and the drafts have also been great fun and spice things up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

click the option below, to view the server or w/e and then it opens a tab below and you have another option to add to favorites.  That one works for me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you start making a lot of competitions with prices and stuff, you'll see how everybody starts to show up, lol.<br>

Even more that nowadays it's a free game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

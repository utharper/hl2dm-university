	<div class="content">just bought this off steam.  i started playing the original game but it had a major issue where it would stutter all the time, made it unplayable.  looked like so much fun and i also hoped they would fix it.  well they did, digitally remastered it and added a huge DLC for $39.  check out the website, this game looks really, really good<br>

<br>
if you're gonna troll my thread and insult me for no reason atleast do a little bit of research first.  <br>
<br>
i didnt buy the original, i had read of the stuttering issue so i played the demo first.  saw it was true.  i got my hands on a cracked version to see if the full game was better, wasnt.  but you couldnt know i hadnt bought the orignal.  so lets assume i did for your sake.  if you have the orignal the digitally remastered version does not require purchasing.  it is distibuted via patch.  all save files still work.  the add on pack can be purchased by itself if you have the original game if you want, if not, you still get the overhaul patch for free.  if you dont have the original game you can purchase the new remastered version and the add on pack for $39. further they arent an american developer and instead of just putting out a DLC to make money, they took the time to fix the orignal first and give to their customers for free.  your post makes no sense.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

which stalker did you get?  i played shadow of chernobyl and i thought it was garbage at first, but i gave it a chance.  im glad i did.  game was really nice.  i have clear sky and call of pripyat but have yet to play them.  i have read that they do require a decent system to play tho, more then they lead you to believe in the system requiements,not saying you dont have one, but if you dont ,that might have been the issue.  the environment and game play is deffinetly different then standard western style gameplay.  i found it to be a nice change.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

sorry, i read your post and forgot about it due to fearsome's post.  ummmmm,  what do you mean by "classic" RPG?  if you are refering to the targeting system/movement style, i.e. hack and slash/point and click, then no, its not.  it plays like oblivion.  third person WASD movement and crosshair aiming.  i have only played a few hours so far, but from what i have seen its WELL worth $39.<br>
<br>
<br>
edit:  btw, if you have any other questions you need answered to help you make a purchase decision post em and ill be happy to help you out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is exactly what I'm looking for. I hate how in some RPG's you have to constantly pause the game to tell your character what to do. In Dragon Age Origins I was sick of baby-sitting my whole team of 4 as they kept on running up to monsters and kicking them in the balls <span style="text-decoration:underline">even</span> though I put in their combat to stay back and shoot with arrows.<br>
Also not to mention frustrating that your character's aim sucks so much that arrows and swords used to miss 75% of the time.<br>
<br>
One character to control, Real time action, cursor aim and looting! Sounds great.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">you can still get the demo for the old title which is ego dragonis.   that way you will get a general feel for how your character will move.  keep in mind the graphics and gameplay movement will be much smoother in the new version.  there will be stuttering in the demo you wont get in the new version(unless they fixed the demo, not sure)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

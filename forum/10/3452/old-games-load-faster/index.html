	<div class="content">So i have searched the web alot for this and couldn't even find  anything close to being useful.<br>
<br>
I have a bunch of old games i love to play (Deus ex series for example) DX2 for example is a 2003 game.  I have a quad core processor with 4 gb of ram and a 9800gx2, for christ sake, could the game not take 30 seconds to load a level???<br>
<br>
Is there a way to somewhat pre-cache the game and then play it? or would it require some kind of crazy coded patch thing.<br>
<br>
I'm really pissed because the game size unpacked isnt even a GB and i have shittons of RAM/HDD space.<br>
<br>
Any clues, gentlemen?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well my point is, if i could, i can install the entire game solely on RAM space. there must be some kind a way to speed shit up, i cant believe i need a raptor HD to increase load times of a 6 years old games with pre-historic graphics, jeez</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I disagree with this a bit.   Yes hard drive speed is a factor, but in my experience CPU speed, Cache size can effect load up of programs.  However I have seen noticiable differences with greater amounts of ram and believe it or not a huge difference with motherboards.<br>
<br>
When I built my computer, I put a Intel 975XBX 2, known on computer sites as a Badaxe2 in there and that was pretty fast.  Not long ago I upgraded to an ASUS Rampage Formula MB and holy shit that thing loads windows 2x as fast as the old MB did.  I was very surprised/impressed that a MB would make that big of a difference.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, Conflict, did you try running the game in a compatibility mode for older windows compatible software?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yea i tried, i think i just need some ways to tell the game it can leech as much ressources it needs. since its a 2003 game im pretty sure it wont take over 512mb or some weak stuff by deafault.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">maybe you could try a ramdisk. Google install ramdisk whatever your OS is.<br>
<br>
It probably is your hard drive. I found I had a nice computer but luke with his hunk of crap was beating me into maps. When I upgraded my hard drive to a WD 640 I now beat most people into maps. In a short while SSDs may finally be ready for primetime at affordable prices. For now a reasonable fast HDD like WD 320GB platters and Samsung spin points are fast value drives, you could also spring for a raptor. <br>
<br>
The only other option is if you can somehow convince Vista to preload the maps. It works pretty well for regularly used programs. But i do not know if it preloads regularly used files.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

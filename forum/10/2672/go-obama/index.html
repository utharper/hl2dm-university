	<div class="content">obama's message is an impossible one to sustain for four years; you can't maintain 'change' while in office like that. i can easily see him losing in four years, but imo either way it's a given his popularity is gonna plummet. it's not like a message of change is a somehow a new phenomenon anyway; people forget bush was the candidate of change in 2000. it's just that now there's a new face attracting different people<br>
<br>
obama supporters (and obama himself) love to talk about how how obama's going to bring parties and people together blah blah. there was a great article in the washington post a week or so ago about this. how obama criticized mccain about using scare tactics at the convention then a week later he's running ads saying mccain's going to privatize social security and cut benefits for seniors by 50%. republicans are gonna be bitter over this guy who most of them hate; i think change in this regard is pretty much out. so we'll have to see what tangible 'change' he's gonna bring</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

With this election, you'll have 1 &amp; 3 pretty strong with a Democratic majority.  But if #4 is against anything they bring up, you can forget about it.  I don't care which party has the majority.  The president can only do so much.  But as for 4 years down the road, it seems on most issues, the political memory is short term at best.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Palin was out of her fucking mind thinking that creationism shud b taught in schools.  i think that every church out there that wants to insert itself into american politics shud NOT be exempt from taxation.  either pay the bills with the rest of us or shut the fuck up.  <br>

I dont like to be racist, except when telling a good joke, but I cant help but feel a lot of his votes came from the young crowd just based on his ethnicity (sp?)  and the change we needed, (sure is a change to have a black man as president), and who really wanted McCain to begin with?  The republicans failed there I think.  Young president vs.  80 yr old president...one with a young ass vice president, and one with an old ass vice president.  It's so funny seeing similaritys between parties, not wanting one to have the advantage, of course, but funny none the less<br>

by better foreign relations i am hoping that obama firstly abolishes the atrocity known as guantanamo bay.  its amazing how bush was able to create such an institution and not cause an all out ww3 making every noble nation in existance join forces to destroy the completely inhumane creature our nation has become under the bush regime. hell man...if we can just somehow take babysteps toward changeing our government to be at least moraley acceptable in terms of world focus, than it is a victory for every american who sees a clear line between right and wrong.<br>
im sure 3rd world nations who allow sweatshops to exist loved bush for giving tax breaks to nations that outsource our jobs to groups of starving people who have NO FUCKING CHOICE other than to work for UNACCEPTABLE wages.<br>
<br>
<br>
mccain agrees and sided with president bush on almost every issue that has been raised in the last eight years.  he is a good man imo....but we do not need republican fuckups at the steering wheel any longer.  the president is just one part of the vehicle called usa that is obviously in a collision course to the nearest oak tree. but if the president is the man at the wheel, and can detour the course even minimally, we might just miss the tree and continue on the bumpy ass road known as world relations.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Bush's HORRIBLE policies have lead to an expansion of the US economy the size of the entire Chinese economy during his tenure. Millions of jobs, record Stock Market...<br>
All AFTER 911 and the uncertain atmosphere.<br>
<br>
And the current mess is the direct result of a liberal Democrat scandal of mega- proportions: The GSE/Sub-Prime disaster, which COULD have been averted, had Democrats not blocked any action on Fannie Mae.<br>
The this, the biggest scandal of my lifetime is not even reported.<br>
<br>
All this talk of "Failure" is a load of nonsense. It is not even supported by the economic facts of the last 8 years.<br>
It is Leftist propaganda.<br>
<br>
Its too bad your are not a business major. You would have an entirely different view, namely, higher corporate and capital gains taxes will KILL the economy and result in high unemployment.<br>
If you care for the poor so much, stroke a check!</div></blockquote>

<br>
Oh please...don't bring up that Fannie/Freddie thing as a strictly democrat failure. If you want me to write a page and a half about the various senate and house comittees, sub-committees under Republican chairmanship and majority from 1995-2006 that failed to listen to outcries and special assigments to assess fannie and freddie I could. Both hands are bloody from this mess. These new taxes Obama proposes, many of which won't pass through the house, will not kill the economy, you have my word on that as well as being a former Business major.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

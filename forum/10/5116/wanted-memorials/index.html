	<div class="content">Frank has a nice memorial spray for MIKE IN BOSTON.  Frank, if you can pm me an attachment of that pic... i'd appreciate it.  i tried a ss in game and the quality just wasn't there.<br>
<br>
there are some fraggers no longer with us.  i know of a few (maybe just because im an old man, lol).  i'd like to ask for you creative folks to come up with a spray for them... and any other deceased dm'ers that anyone else would like to add.  i'd prefer to keep it limited to hl2dm players.<br>
<br>
you can either pm the attachment to me... or display it in this thread to show off your skillz.<br>
<br>
my current spray is a product of Neolinkster... probably one of my oldest hl2dm e-friends.  and i appreciate it VERY much!  i anticipate using the memorial sprays in a future video.<br>
<br>
being old and prone to unexpected life contingencies and plain old ignorance... this video may never happen.  but i'd still like to see some memorial sprays... whether in my own pc collection... or sprayed on the walls in pubs.  maybe some nice mapper could incorporate them into a kick-ass map?<br>
<br>
here is my honor roll...<br>
<br>
MIKE IN BOSTON<br>
P!ke<br>
{=xXx=} Puke Spray<br>
{=xXx=} Forsaken<br>
<br>
i dont have dates of death off the top of my head... but pm me if you want them.  im sure i can eventually come up with that info.  im not a stickler for the clan tag being included.  i know Mike was in EE... but EE has so many variations... i didnt know the proper/preferred tag.  anyone with irl photos of the honored is encouraged to post them here.<br>
<br>
anyone with demos of the honored is encouraged to pm them to me!  or upload them someplace where i can have access.<br>
<br>
thanks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

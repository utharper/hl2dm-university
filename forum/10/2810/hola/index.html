Rachkir I hear your frustration man and I can relate because I sometimes feel the same.  I have learned to ignore much of the BS that happens here and in game because its the only way I can continue to enjoy the game I love, play with the people I enjoy playing with and continue to contribute in a positive way.<br>
<br>
You need to learn to relax and not take this all so seriously.  If you can't then delete the damn game and find another or just take a sledge hammer to the computer and walk away.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

voxtex. you are a prime example of why this place is worthless to many in the game.  besides the map downloads and the mapping areas of the forum, all this place does is show the pettiness of the community and all the juveniles that take place in it.  <br>
<br>
makes people degrade themselves having to respond to bullshit posted here, but feel they need to so they dont lose face in the dm world.  <br>
<br>
i didnt want to sit there and post after post after post with bahlk today, but can one person just sit there and let someone talk shit and not respond?  i havent learned how to do that yet, thus I want banned, so I dont have to deal with it. <br>
<br>
go slit your wrists.  thats the most ignorant thing ive ever heard from someone in a long time.  go hax ur nades on some other newbs fucking loner.  <br>
<br>
you guys seriously ever wonder why theres no one new posting here?  because its junk, because WT and Keeper let every dickwad in the community say dumb shit everyday on the message board.  look at the dates on forum areas that actually pertain to the game...they are old as fuck.  no one trys to do anything here, except spam bullshit and LOL threads.  <br>
<br>
tired of feeling I need to come here to see whats new and happening in the game, when in reality its nothing but childish jibberish.  <br>

in response to the U:<br>
i was upset with the game and ready to give it up.  The University stepped up to plate and was sympathic, with the exception of the regular dickheads on here.  I chilled out and started to enjoy the game again.  <br>
<br>
and then today:<br>
today me and bahlk got into a shit fest, which is all cool mind you.  I was upset at myself for being on here for so long, so I asked for a perma ban so this place waste no more time.  And I still am because I feel I need to defend myself from assholes like voxtex who just slam people.  which is why i keep coming back here, its a lose lose situation. <br>

You have serious issues if you have trouble pulling away from HL2DM. You are just trying to get attention on the forums, probably due to real life issues. It's ok Rachkir, you are a failure, the sooner you accept it the easier it is. Aren't you unemployed with a kid?

Can't ban myself y'know! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
Seriously though, the real troublemakers here do get banned, most everyone here is pretty laid back and even when discussions get heated it is rare for things to turn into a total flame war. I'm pretty proud of this community considering how many diverse people and groups are represented. In terms of what value this site has, I have personally gotten quite a lot out of it. I think HL2DM has enjoyed a longer shelf-life for many people as a result of everything that has been contributed, not just by the Board Members, but by everyone. Hell, the frag vids and maps that have been posted here alone have made it worthwhile for me.<br>

I wish you all the best man, and I mean that in all seriousness.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The video is one single take, yeah, but it may have taken a few tries to get it right.  I could never see that going right in one take on the first try. I don't read French, so if it says something different in the description then my bad.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They planned it on paper for a month and then it took them a couple of tries to nail it perfectly as some of the 100+ students starring in the video had no clue what they had to do until the date of the shoot. It's the comm class who organized it all as part as a class project.<br>
<br>
The video is a 1 take, no editing movie. Music was playing but barely audible as the camera guy walked by, they previously walked around the school with the song playing and had markups as to who must be where and what to do, hence some of the actions showing up late (like in the escalator).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They booked certain areas of the school, probably on weekends or past 18h.<br>
then they sent notices about X rooms of the school being under restricted acces on X date / time so people would know these spots wouldnt be accessible on this day. It's common practice for them to use this spot for large scale projects like that, I've been to some seminar or just random activities where this was the meeting point or center of interest w/e<br>
<br>
Long story short...<br>
<br>
Q: ''how did they close this part of the school''<br>
A: ''They asked for it.''</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

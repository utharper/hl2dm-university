A). You're not a competitive player and also have 'whined' about the League-Mandated Mod quite a bit, so I am not all that inclined to listen to you. <br>
B). Helix, once finished, adequately replaces amplitude since it has almost the same theme: vertical flow, complex layout with more of an emphasis on missile precision (as opposed to hitscan), the control areas and cramped and closed in whereas the areas teams are "flowing-from" are open-air and sky-lined. <br>
I would love to see a revision/reworking of amplitude, but Fearsome has that German mapper to himself and seems to treat him like a mushroom with the spoon-feeding of shit ideas and the keeping of the guy in the dark most of the time. <br>
Marty should've had that Oscar from Gangs of New York, not have to wait for The Departed. Fuck Middle-Earth. <br>
C). Wtf is it with you and Nino? Backbone is a terrible map from a terrible bygone time of when mappers thought the room proportions of fucking lockdown were actually some kind of "good." Slams are broken and only should exist in a ctf game setting where your teammates cannot set them off. I guess its you old people who like the slower maps so your head does not hurt. <br>
Get off the road, you're gonna fucking kill someone who matters to society. <br>
<br>
Before you get your vein's all puffy, I suggest you actually speak with some of the top environment guys in hl2dm that I have worked with. <br>

Totally forgot about that nice map; needs one transition to be edited (or removed), have one type of lift (I think there is 2 of them) panned-over to give a better vertical-projection angle, have the newguy_formula applied to props, and if you allow the player to have two entrances/exits to each the mags/shottys (keeping with your tig-jump idea) it would make the nay-say'rs of that map stfu and play it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

In one thread, where I push for eFPS to just switch to the mod immediately after Valve's nerfing of the 'stock' game, you start posting all this crap about models to spam the thread and moan about how no one plays it and: 
<blockquote><div><cite>The Argumentalizer wrote:</cite>Eat your heart out newguy!!!!!!!</div></blockquote> <br>
As well as your bashing of the mod in EE's teamspeak. All of which I consider to be whining, but enough of that. <br>
<br>
The mod doesn't to cater to pubbers, which is all you do, so that's why it is not for you.  <br>
You may have played more league matches, but not competitive-oriented/minded scrims. Oh my, not by a long shot. <br>
Be it in pre-nerfing stock or James' mod. Even still, I know more than you on said subject, and that was the point. <br>
<br>
You not participating is actually preferable to me; you're not the demographic I want the mod to grow for and cater to. <br>

First off, being that efps is using the OB mod, why not ask Subzero to make the slams not hurt teammates like we do in hl2ctf. It just makes more sense right? I think it does. Could even colorize the slam lines so you know it's your team's slam (like in hl2ctf <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">). This wouldnt take much time to code in.<br>
<br>
ps,<br>
I find it amusing that you think you are the only one that understands weapon placement around here. I'm not knocking you, but there are a bunch of guys that have been playing this game and fps games in general for a very long time. Every person will always have a little bias towards certain weapons in this game and placement is based on that bias. Which is why the mapper should always take in more then 1 opinion when it comes to weapon/hp, suit placement.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">In a perfect world Sac, I would fucking love it if James just decided to help you guys out, and the <em class="text-italics">competition-mod</em> for the hl2dm community had a ctf mode in it. That would be utter-Rape; however, I am fairly certain he just stole some code from the AG2 team in order to port the game over to the source 2007 engine, and so he would not really be much "help" to your guys' ctf team. HL2CTF still uses source 2006, yes? James is also busy with school this summer and is only one guy who is very busy with shit that actually pays. I very much like the product the CTF team has made and is much more professional than that of the current OB mod. Only qualms I had with CTF was that many of the extra or "new"" weapons just seemed like better versions of other weapons and a misplaced/awkward effort to add a new dynamic to the same style of game. It would be great if I could just swap-out or have said weapons 'upgraded' instead of a whole new bind and "different" weapon. For instance, my crossbow swapped/upgraded to the rail gun. The same can be said with Alex's pistol. I know I could just make a double-bind type thing to accomplish this, but I didn't feel like it. I then became discouraged from exploring the balance of those new weapons because they seemed to have been based on a already broken weapon system from Valve. Seriously, every single weapon apparatus - except the crossbow - is unbalanced in hl2dm. Hit-scan knock-back is a piece-of-shit, too. All of which were things fine tuned for a basic, linear, no Z-axis movement system that lasted a mere matter of months. Then the bhop came about and the flying-in-your-face combat along with it. All a matter of opinion, I know. And I now digress, I am sure Impala will bitch at me for that.<br>
<br>
Thing is Sac, I don't force my bias upon people. I try to find out what the mapper is looking for in their creative work then help them present it in a way that will be most adaptable to the most number of players. I am not some creative wonder that comes up with all this self-proclaimed "awesome shit." I am an humanist and a creative-entrepreneur. I know people and how to relate to/manipulate them as well as how to take one creative guy/gal's idea and make it better with open, fluid, collaboration. I have a huge ego on these forums but really, I pander to mappers. Its why I say I have a small dick and show that I really don't give a fuck about me. If you knew me personally and knew the number of times I attempted suicide and/or my mental-issues you would understand that to be fact. The artificial ego thing is, in reality, a therapy technique. Enough of that. <br>
<br>
I give mappers what they look for: someone spending nearly as much time as they do developing and appreciating their work.

I am not the only one who knows, I am just the only one left who gives enough of a fuck to speak such knowledge to mappers on new environments. <br>
Other people have played other games, but that does not mean they will know jack @ a temperamental game like hl2dm. <br>
I love VitaminG, but ethic has bad weapon-gathering flow and has too-steep of vertical angles. Why? He plays Quake. <br>
Quake (outside of QuakeWorld/QuakeMods) has no ability to change direction in mid-air. A dynamic I fucking love in hl2dm. <br>
Quake players, once aflight, want to get back on the ground asap so they can start their bhop and control their shit once again.<br>
That's why a map like Octagon feels awkward, cramped, and sharp-edged at all areas. It's layout was designed for a totally different engine. <br>
<br>
Yes, source was based of off HLengine which was q3 modded, blah-blah, w/e. <br>
The two are like diesel and petrol now, beyond 2005. I am no expert on such a thing, so Valar may correct my analogy. <br>
<br>
In sum: My weapon Bias has got to be grenades, and I am very upfront about it. I don't keep my "real" opinions candid to mappers like someone such as Fearsome. <br>
If a map needs to be utterly rebuilt, I say so, then take a good long while to explain why; this is out of respect of the effort the mapper has put forth - for free mind you. <br>
I then go out and force maps on scrims: Most recently with Minelab and Asylum, soon Infinity as well. <br>
I keep record of other peoples take on the map, for they are MUCH more honest when the mapper is not around. <br>
I present the info, the vast amount of it, and it is appropriated as the mapper sees fit. <br>
<br>
I do not think *my* ideas when I playtest a map are better than everyone else's, but my efforts of playtesting most certainly are. <br>

The idea is as old as when CTF and AG first implemented it years ago and its as good now as it was then. As were hit-sounds and team-color-matching HuD's. <br>
At the beta 3 version of OB mod, I was ignorant to the other Mod's ideas and was saying for such similar things to be put into the OB mod. <br>
It has yet to be done because things like the MOVEMENT took precedent back then. Oh yah, and James is just one student of coding.
<blockquote><div><cite>Da1 wrote:</cite>Backbone isn't a bad map NG.</div></blockquote> <br>
For pubbing, not at all. Nope. <br>
It could be okay with some major transition editing and applying the newguy_formula. <br>
It is utter bloody shit atm, but then again so is a newborn Caucasian baby. <br>

Only qualms I had with CTF was that many of the extra or "new"" weapons just seemed like better versions of other weapons and a misplaced/awkward effort to add a new dynamic to the same style of game. It would be great if I could just swap-out or have said weapons 'upgraded' instead of a whole new bind and "different" weapon. For instance, my crossbow swapped/upgraded to the rail gun. The same can be said with Alex's pistol. I know I could just make a double-bind type thing to accomplish this, but I didn't feel like it. I then became discouraged from exploring the balance of those new weapons because they seemed to have been based on a already broken weapon system from Valve. </div></blockquote> They are similar, but very different. I guess they are the same type of weapon (IE pistol/alyx PISTOL), but that is about as far as it goes. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>srslyNOTnewguy wrote:</cite>Seriously, every single weapon apparatus - except the crossbow - is unbalanced in hl2dm. Hit-scan knock-back is a piece-of-shit, too. All of which were things fine tuned for a basic, linear, no Z-axis movement system that lasted a mere matter of months. Then the bhop came about and the flying-in-your-face combat along with it. All a matter of opinion, I know. And I now digress, I am sure Impala will bitch at me for that.</div></blockquote>I think this is a matter of opinion. I think there are 3 weapons that need "tweaked". The rpg is too strong, the shotgun spread needs adjusted so it does hardly any damage beyond 15 to 20 ft and the magnum should be a nerfed some. At the same time, it is even for both sides, so does any of that really matter that much in a competition setting?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So many people have told me to map, but I am such a fucking pussy. I'll get on it. <br>
Well... maybe not this:

It matters for the competition scene as a whole, hl2dm is a joke. <br>
The fact that so many ulgy nerds like Constipator and Nutri-Grain can sit back and mag whore all day is disgusting. And it looks like shit.<br>
EDIT: or Billy and Vapor to use the shotty like that, TLC and blast with orbs, etc.<br>
If ANYONE hopes for a pr0-style or skill-based game to make money, it has to look good from an ignorant-spectators perspective. <br>
<br>
It's why Football surpassed baseball as America's #1 sport. <br>
<br>
While I am learning to map, I should learn to model and make a more balanced game myself. <br>
<br>
Can NEVER do code though. Never. I am not the linear, mechanic-minded person. <br>
I could learn creative arts if I talked less and did more. <br>
<br>
Check back in 2 years. <br>

Well, mapping and modelling wont create a game on it's own. You need coding. And yes, the 2 weapons you speak of are retarded in dm. I really like the mag,  but its way to one sided and easy to shoot. The shotty is just laughable. Im laughing about it right now lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, it is a shitty clan. All you have is a bunch of inactive people who call themselves a "family" and a forum. If you're a so-called "family" why did Sgt. Pepper say that when he disappeared for months nobody cared enough to even message him to see what was up, even though you're all friends on facebook? The only respectable people left in EE are Frank, Bot, and maybe New Guy (if you consider talking about your cock all day respectable). Most of the other people are assholes, I say most cause I'm probably forgetting somebody. Do me a favor and stfu.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">#tryhard virgins are cute at first; in fact, they're almost adorable, but it is only for a fleeting moment. For as you dwell upon the sight of them, they become a sad, putrid, and revolting experience much like when the ignorant child beholds the clubbing of baby seals.   <br>
<br>
You were amusing at first, nervous, but now - and in a relatively short span of time - it has just become sad and ugly. <br>
Just as if it were the still warm and salivating carcasses of those aforementioned marine mammals, I really don't wanna touch this shitfest. <br>
<br>
All I will say is that if we took half the money that was sunk (like the fucking titanic) into STOCK hl2dm for a league within eFPS and presented it to James, letting him know that his free-time for coding a pro-style mod would NOT just be for shits an giggles, we may (as a community) see a rather fun, well administrated, competitive game spring up for all the die-hard hl2dm fans that still linger around. <br>
Hell, I would have &lt;That Porn Server&gt; back up and running if fatpipe did not fold and get absorbed into ultimategameserver. <br>
I will start another thread asking people that are still here in DM what hosting companies are "good" nowadays.  <br>
<br>
The huge problem facing this fetal idea is exactly what conflict was eluding to: people will need to spend a lot of time and coin for a rather shitty and unbalanced game. People will have to deal w/ "the source 2007 NOT source 2009" headache w/ hosting companies as well as putting up monthly charges. People will have to contribute to a collection so that James, hypothetically and without any "legally-legit" guarantee, will have more motivation to correct coding issues in a more timely manner, which can only go so far as the one man can do. <br>
<br>
The competitive hl2dm community will need to allocate time, money, and patience (shit we are NOT fucking known for) and do this as a whole. <br>
In order to do that, we would have to agree and act as a whole.<br>
When the fuck has that ever happened? <br>
<br>
Except Fearsome being a pretentious cunt; we got that one down, but even then there is the isolated sub-categorical debate as to whether his "head is up his fucking ass" or that he "doesn't know his own ass from a hole in the fucking ground."  <br>
Perhaps he is not even a man at all, but this is not the time to delve into such perennial questions within the insatiable lore of hl2dm myth and legend. <br>
<br>
This mod is still not good: one server is windows and kinda lousy with no fast DL and such, and the other in a linux-hack of source 2009 with its own set of issues.<br>
I do believe it is a step in the right direction, Tiggy tested a lot of hacks that wouldn't work and the skill ceiling is higher than that of pre-OB-update stock hl2dm. <br>
<br>
But unless we find person(s) willing to spend dispensable cash on a pro-style game, it will continue to lie motionless. <br>

Draft Night was frustrating because whoever was running this shit wasnt harsh enough. I was always late at draft nights - because I knew I could.<br>
Basic human behaviors are only AMPLIFIED online, so is procrastination. Give people the option of being late, they will, trust me.<br>
<br>
Draft night can work if the process of team picking is totally random (using a random team maker software, like sport game randomizer thing)<br>
it takes A CLICK to get the teams done.<br>
play, glhf.<br>
<br>
If only 2 teams shows, make them fight each other and let the other know they missed it and that it was load of fun, next time theyll be on time and we wont be fucking waiting our lives for others who might not even show up in the first place.<br>
<br>
I never understood the need to implement a fictuous bureaucracy of complicated virtual paperwork to get shit done  - especially in hl2dm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

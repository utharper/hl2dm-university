Fatpipe was expensive but worth it. Now their former support guy, who currently works for UGS, says the new company's servers are utter shit compared to fatpipes'. <br>
<br>
I plan to get TPS back up in the OB mod. <br>
<br>
Any of you all have any experiences or suggestions that relate to what companies I should shop at?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Come on Da1, I been down on  hl2dm recently as well but I see some hope that we can still play a great version of the game.<br>
I have seen a average of 60 players a day on my OBmod server jump to 100,200 and today 560 players, it seems people are playing.<br>
It's a nobrainer that this mod is 100x better and hopefully the regular players will continue to play the mod when they want a "real" game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">as soon as aim_arena_reloaded was released, we added it to our server. Later we had to upload the fixed version. After this, nobody can enter by downloading it from the server =S.<br>
Whenever somebody downloads it from the server, as soon as the download is finished, a message pops-up saying map differs from the server, and doesn't allow people to enter. The only way of getting into the server is downloading the map from the university and placing it into the maps folder.<br>
Is there a way to correct this?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">is it because these players have the older version of aim_arena_reloaded in their maps folder? <br>
<br>
if so they can delete it from their maps folder and then try reconnecting to the server.  If not I don't know maybe there is a problem with the map?<br>
<br>
does the new version of aim_arena_reloaded have the same name? if so I can see why that would happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
The original aim_arena_reloaded was released. You put this map on your server. There proved to be a minor bug which was fixed. The aim_arena_reloaded was fixed and put back out. All the people who have visited your server downloaded the original. You have the new one on your server, they have the old one. They can't play. If I was Ko, I was just release the exact same reloaded but make it r1 so there is no confusion.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No, lol. Most of you misunderstood me. Maybe I explained myself wrong o_0.<br>
After getting complaints from people that couldn't enter to the server, I took the aim_arena_reloaded from my maps folder, and downloaded it from the server, having the same results that they did.<br>
Some of them had the old map, and had to delete it. Others didn't, but independently of this, non of them could enter.<br>
<br>
I thought that something like WT said was happening, but wasn't sure if that was possible.

I think this will come on handy.<br>

Is the map on your gameserver, the exact same one on your website ?<br>
<br>
Try commenting out the download URL, and see if it still gives you the same message. You gotta make sure you have uploaded the exact same file on the gameserver and webserver. What I think is happening, is the you have the old aim_arena, on the site, and the new one on the gameserver, but they are both named the same, so perhaps your thinking you have done everything correctly.<br>
<br>
Give that a try lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">=S It's kind of a mess. The thing is that even though I play everyday on that server, and it's the only one on my country, it's not really  "mine". I just have admin privileges, and know the guy who is in charge of modifying it and everything, so I told him to upload the map. As far as I was told, It seems that the server doesn't use URL downloads, so it's very  weird. I ended up sending a pm to him, asking him to take the map out, since just a limited number of people could play it, and now, we just have aim_arena_b4. However, I told him to upload it again to see how it goes, but seems he is busy and hasn't answered my pm. Anyway, if I manage to fix it, I'll let you know. Again thanks for the help and concern <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

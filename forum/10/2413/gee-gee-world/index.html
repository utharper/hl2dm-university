Yeah its pretty amazing what this hadron collider does, and what they may be able to learn from it. There are some people who are convinced that when the particles collide in a future successful test that the collision of protons could eventually imperil the Earth by creating micro-black holes, subatomic versions of collapsed stars whose gravity is so strong they can suck in planets and other stars. Should be interesting to see what really happens, and hope that the worst does not happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well it was actually switched on, on tuesday at around 08:30 GMT though only 1 channel was activated, over the next few weeks they are hoping to be adding more channels and thus gain more data, this experiment was not just thought it on the spot as a bit of fun, it has been in development for 25 years and has helped create or advance many world technologies, anyone here ever heard of the internet? You know that little thing that's just taking off? Yes they helped develop a portion of it because they needed to be able to transfer large amounts of information quickly to all the labs to speed up analysis. Also medical scanners such as CAT or MRI scanners stem from this "waste of money". Many new cures for diseases could be found through this experiment as we are going to find out how the building blocks of the universe are made which will give us a much greater understanding of everything around us. And yes there were some protests about black holes being formed and the Earth being sucked into them... but as the scientists have said many times over (which the worlds media seem to ignore) they will be creating incredibly tiny black holes but they will appear and disappear quicker than a blink of an eye (also this occurs naturally), also the theory of them creating a gateway to another dimension is pure fiction and whoever believes that kind of rubbish really shouldn't be allowed to breed.<br>

pretty much what he says, a black hole can be any shap mass or size, and all a black really is is a ball of energy, and once that energy is used up it is gone. <br>
<br>
but as for cat scan and mri (mri is fairly new) but the physics behind diagnostic imaging is the same as it was over a 100 years ago hahahahah</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

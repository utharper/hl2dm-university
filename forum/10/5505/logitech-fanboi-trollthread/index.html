Yup. Ive used all three (Logitech mx518, Razor Lachesis, Steelseries XAI) and the steelseries is by far the best of the 3. The Mx518 was a real nice mouse too. Lachesis was poopoo. I've heard good things about the G9 and the older Razors though</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not from steelseries, they made a good laser out of the gate.<br>

The only problem with this is I use my mouse A LOT and dead skin cells seem to build up where I put my fingers. EWW.<br>
<br>
Too true that customizable profiles are awesome. I love how they automatically switch modes when you get in a program. Couldn't do mapping so quick without it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">.<br>
<br>
Two problems I've had with it though: the scroll wheel broke and got stuck in hyper scroll. I had it only for a month and I was distraught. Not thinking about complaining to Logitech and getting another one I Disassembled the mouse and fixed it --&gt; voiding my warranty. Also the braided cord made a huge kink in the wire and I had to cut it before it damaged the connection.<br>

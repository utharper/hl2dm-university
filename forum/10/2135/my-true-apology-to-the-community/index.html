	<div class="content">It is really hard for me to figure out how to start this post, I've given it so much thought for the past few months, I've been trying to make it better, and briggs helped me realize an easier way to say I am sorry. I've been a major dick to the community. From killing people snd_restarting, to talking shit and spraying out of frustration. I posted bad on here, and the posts weren't just bad, but they were really bad, and I've been thinking how immature and humiliating to myself they were, or all of my actions for that matter.<br>
<br>
To the forums: I'd like to say I am deeply sorry for all of my rude and uncalled for comments/posts, being a member of this game, and liking it, I feel that I should be more respecting towards it. This site is made to show people how to get good, what to do, and what not to do, obviously I set the not to do guide lines; Being a member of this community and even being allowed to post on these forums should be a privilege for me and all the shit I've done. Walking Target, and other site admins, I'm sorry for having given you a hard time even though I've been shown the rules so many times. I really am. I'm also sorry to the community for that, you guys come here to learn, make friends, talk, and have a good time, I spoil all of that when I post.<br>
<br>
To specific players: First off, the person I've probably pissed off most, him being younger than me I should have set an example. Exodus, a lot of people say you call for the abuse, I've even said it but that was out of being irritated and again immature. When you were on my friends list and actually talking to me and when we weren't arguing you were a pretty cool kid. When I think about it my smart remarks are probably what got you pissed at me. I'm sorry man.<br>
<br>
sisterFISTER: Dude, I'm not going to lie, most of your comebacks are funny. I've said a lot of rude shit to you to begin with though. I don't really talk to you that much but when I did it wasn't really anything good. Sorry.<br>
<br>
[VDuS] A Seagull: ... I know I'm annoying to you man. I've said gay shit to you also, really gay shit. I completely ignored that fact that you were probably asked by so many people a day to 1on1, and knowing you didn't like to, I still kept trying. I made some really bad posts about you and [~$W~] LukeGT421 being afraid to play me. That was definitely the wrong thing to say, because I really should have just respected your decision and left it how it was. It certainly didn't make anything better. I'm sorry Seag.<br>
<br>
[~$W~] LukeGT421: The same thing for seagull's basically, you've shown me a lot of stuff and I disrespectfully gave you attitude when I would get frustrated.<br>
<br>
[VDuS] Yard_guy: I'm apologizing to you even because I've sprayed you before also out of frustration. You took it an insult, I saw that... but I proceeded to do it. Sorry man, you've helped me out a lot. I shouldn't have acted like that.<br>
<br>
Sted: I've done SO much shit to you back in the Vex days man. The random sendings to meatspin through rcon commands, spraying you even when you just came into the server to have fun. You can be a cool guy, I've seen it, a lot of people have seen it, some have saw the opposite, but I think that's because they chose to like I did. Sorry man.<br>
<br>
[VDuS] Scar^: Dude, I jumped on your ass for those posts when I told people they could flame me all they wanted, you're a cool guy, always have been to me... both you and Constipator. I didn't really mean what I posted in that forum, from what I heard, you've been really chill when you play, I played with you on Sunday even, for draft, we did good even though we lost, damn zeta <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">.<br>
<br>
Kyle^ and 2Qu!ck: I am saying sorry to both of you here at the same time because I've pissed both of you off before... I'm not quite sure with Kyle but I do remember making you very angry at me. Sorry bro. Ace, we've been cool lately I hope to keep it that way. I've been really cocky towards you and others and I really shouldn't have.<br>
<br>
mLIQUID: Dude, how could I even have gotten pissed at you, you've been one of the nicest people I've met ingame, and I sprayed you because of some silly comment, so sorry dude.<br>
<br>
|911| Va|: I've acted like a dick to you for no apparent reason, you never really deserved any of it, the sprays random comments, and laughing at you when you got voted out of UG| <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> sorry man.<br>
<br>
There are so many other people that I did not list above, but what I said does not only apply to the people listed but the whole community because odds are, if you got pissed at me it's because of one of the reasons above.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to all of you.<br>
<br>

I gotta say I noticed something was up the last time I talked to you about a week ago, you seemed like a completely different person. I think what you just did will go a long way on restoring some peoples thoughts about you and if you keep that attitude up I think the game will be much more enjoyable for you. I always respected your skill and now Ill start respecting you as a person.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This post feels truly honest. I admire when people take a moment to think about them and how they react to life stuff etc.  Kudos and thanks for sharing with us. You gained my respect as well if it's worth anything. XD</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

With the bugs of this game and the neglect from Valve it's hard to keep a positive attitude, but at the same time, IMHO, this game is still a Hell of a lot of fun to play!

	<div class="content">Okay so, I'm rebuilding my rig and the like and I seem to have hit a snag.. Instead of typing everything out again I'll just copy paste what I sent to tech support.  Still asking you guys as well just to get more opinions and such.<br>
<br>
Its a Biostar Motherboard, btw.. (Model TA790GX 128M)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'm completely rebuilding my computer. The only parts transferred from the other PC are the CPU/Heatsink and the Ram (Totals at 4 gigs, 4 1GB sticks.) After hooking everything up including a samsung SATA CD drive and a brand new Western Digital SATA Hard drive, as well as an HIS Radeon HD 4870, I tried to boot up the computer to which it didn't send any video signal to the monitor, I heard no beep from the onboard speaker nor see the bios boot up. Fans and lights turn on but when I go to turn off the computer by the power button, nothing. Reset button doesn't seem to work. Tried the same without the video card on with the same results. Tried moving around and rearranging the jumpers for the LEDs and buttons and speaker and nothing again. Do I have a dead motherboard or is there something not right?</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well, I suppose you could try clearing the CMOS.  it may have gotten a static charge or something and jacked something up.  I cleaned a mobo with a vaccum once, not recommened by the way.  but if fucked everything up and I couldnt get any 'video' response on boot.  Then I listened to my pc, and It wasnt making the normal sounds it does while booting...like accessing the H.D.<br>
<br>
SO, I pulled out the battery, set the jumper to 1-2 instead of 2-3, waited 10 seconds, moved jumper back and reinstalled the battery.<br>
It 'should' say cmos under the jumper.<br>
<br>
Then it worked.  Had to reconfigure some BIOS settings, but it was no biggie.  better than dealing with an RMA I was thinking I may have to do.<br>

Its working now. a 12v connector was hidden in the mass of 8 pin and 6 pin hooked it up and it works like a charm now.<br>

Lets see how long it lasts, I'm hoping I wont have an actual dead board on my hands in the future.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

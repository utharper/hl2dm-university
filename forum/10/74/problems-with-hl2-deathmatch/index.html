	<div class="content">Ok since around last update ive been having weird lag problems with deathmatch that I have not been able to figure out.  This only happens with deathmatch it seems.  I play fear and other games with n/p.  Just to be sure though I checked my internet connection speed and it was fine.  I even made a new cable just in case something was wrong with the other one I was using.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Walking Target and Ko-Taos first few suggestions on the autoexec.cfc I have added<br>
rate 20000<br>
cl_cmdrate 66<br>
cl_updaterate 33<br>
<br>
and that fixes the problem for the first 30 minutes im in the game.  It runs just fine for 30 minutes, then starts lagging and I show loss's of 50 and choke will be at 0.  My frame rate at goes from 80FPS (lowest) to around 280FPS(highest).  I have checked my system for viruses, spyware, trojans, adware , rootkits , you name it I have checked.  I completely uninstalled and deleted the folder for valve and everything with it and reinstalled it in hopes to fix the problem.  I love the game but kind of hard to play when it starts lagging.  As the last incident I was walking , froze , then died hearing no sound.<br>
<br>
I have noticed something odd about it, when it starts, I can minimize the game, then maximize it back and the loss goes back to 0 and the game runs fine again for about 30 minutes.  I have immediately checked temps on video card and processor when the lagging started and both were well within operating range.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any suggestions on what to do?<br>

	<div class="content">Sorry about slow reply, did not realize this thread had been replied to lol.  Anyway I tried decreasing the sound and other things.  I completely formatted my computer just to see if something on it was causing it.  Problem still exist.<br>
<br>
I went to my uncles house and tested it over there using his internet, no change.  Im hosting a lan party tommorow(saturday), so im going to have a friend use his computer with his copy and see if it does it.  If so then it is my isp, which im really starting to believe is where the problem is.<br>
<br>
Anyway once again, sorry for the delayed response , I will post updates as they follow.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

See If I can run across any problems.  Motherboard and video card are both less than 2-3 months old.  At least got me a new good power supply out of the deal lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I got it 2 years ago, but from your description of the problem, its practically the same. Id say its a good time to upgrade it then. <br>

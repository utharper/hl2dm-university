	<div class="content">There will be an upcoming league for HL2dm for those who still want to get whats left of this game we all love. In order to continue we must first take in the people's votes. Do you guys want a Division 1 and 2 or just a Division 1?<br>
<br>
A) Divisions 1 and 2<br>
<br>
B) Division 1<br>
<br>
<br>
*These decisions apply to both 1v1 , 2v2 and maybe a 3v3 ladder depending on the number of players.<br>
<br>
<br>
*The admin is working very hard to have a good league set up and we are looking forward to a clean competition. <br>
<br>
*We will keep you posted on the initial date of the eFPS league as we continue to work on it.<br>
<br>
Note: I take no credit for this league , I am just that guy that runs errands <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Point proven.</div></blockquote>

If no one can tell the difference, how do YOU tell the difference?<br>
Do you hack, therefore you have insight into what Voz is doing, supposedly!?!?<br>
<br>
So, the community should turn their backs on you to, if what you say is true.<br>
Personally, i don't believe anything you say.<br>
You always seem to be up to something.<br>
<br>
So, it seems you are admitting, right to our face, you are a hacker.<br>
WTF!!?!?<br>
Are you STONED?</div></blockquote>

Am I a hacker honestly? No, but like I said I proved my point. Yes I do know what hack was shown in those screenshots. I researched them yes. I researched them for the sole fact of trying to figure out why some 1 week pros were owning me across the map with the shotgun when I knew for a fact they dont know what the fuck they are doing. See sir, I'm not afraid to take one for the team. If I wasn't sure of what people could do, I'd be making false accusations. <strong class="text-strong">Luckily I knew what was shown in those screenshots that were posted. Otherwise everyone would believe v0z's story about overlaying screenshots and taking a GUI from another screenshot. Then you guys would go on your marry way not believing that he hacked because there wasn't someone like me to tell you that YOU ARE WRONG</strong>. It's ok Impala, you can thank me later.<br>
<br>
Oh and to be honest, I don't care if you believe what I have to say. Or if you think I hack or not. There are quite a few people who have been playing me for the longest time and know HOW I play. They know my thoughts and rants on people who do use hacks and that's the only comfort I need. I'm just here to tell you that there are people who are completely full of shit and I can prove it.<br>
<br>
Oh and thanks Val, I'm glad someone realized something for once.</div></blockquote>

u might be cleared in your own mind, and amongst your fellow clan mates, but not with me.  and i doubt im alone in the community.  im voicing my opinion again that your involvement is inappropriate and possibly detrimental to the success of a new league.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't want anymore finger-pointing. Fact of the matter is, no one knows who hacked or did not hack before, and we can't sort that out. What we CAN do is play this game in a safe, cheat-free environment. Cellar, any concerns you have about v0z will be moot when this league begins. If v0z hacks now or ever did, those hacks will not work in the league. The same goes for anyone else in this community. <br>

 And to Celler I had the same concern but apparently there was a confession by our beloved euro friend Raz around cu season 1 and Valiums knew of this and cleared Voz to play in cu and that Raz was trying to get bahlkers to admit he hacked so he went under voz's name ect I know seems far'fetched I had a hard time swallowing it but so the story goes in summery.<br>

Even if there was a governing body to clear your DM name, it still wouldn't help much.<br>
Even if voz didnt do anything, it all went for so long, alot will still believe its bs and whoever said it was alright mustve smoked on this day.<br>
<br>
On the other hand playing other team/players who were previously accused of said ''DM crimes'' in scrims or league, never was a problem. When the NG hacks thing started, i'm pretty sure NG didn't have ANY trouble finding a scrim for him or the team. Same goes for 911 way back/ducer/ace, everyone hated sisterfister yet people played him, encouraging him to stick around... and the list goes on.<br>
<br>
<br>
In short, the only problem right now, is that some points at the witch and yell ''BURN THE WITCH'' while the others are totally fine with inviting her over for a few drinks.<br>

	<div class="content">Nice Divinibade, put it on me. I never actually unbanned it was my co-admin. I did however run a follow up investigation seeking to keep him banned but found some evidence that pointed otherwise. Essentially we sifted through IP records and requested multiple SN's/demos from both players. Throughout these screenshots we noticed Raz had a very specific HUD and resolution, a customized HUD that no one else has.<br>
<br>
So I requested Voz give me a screenshot of a scrim we played the day before all this went down that I know would be from him, turns out Voz has a completely different HUD/res then Raz, and noticed the infamous screenshot had Raz's exact HUD and resolution, down to the T. I somehow doubt Voz within a day intentionally changed his HUD and resolution to Raz's setup because he just felt like it. Being as it was, it became clear it was simply not enough to ban voz off a screenshot that looked exactly like Raz's POV. All that aside I don't believe voz hacks anymore even if we were to assume he did in the past.<br>
<br>
IDK take it for what it is, we also got testimony from Raz himself admitting he did it, and that he did hack. Long story short Divinity needs to go back to eating curry instead of posting in forums, because he's a bad baddie.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I like how I called you out for cheating and tried to get you banned while I was an admin awhile ago and everyone thought I was crazy. So far I'm 3/4 in calling cheaters correctly. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out you shady fuck, feels good I was still able to beat you even while you cheated.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When was that, years and years ago? Back then some hacks were not detected obviously, because they were new. DM is less pupular now and im pretty sure all hacks are detected now dude.<br>

Are you serious? VAC does not detect even half of the shit ESEA does as ESEA client gets updated weekly, sometimes daily for cheat protection.<br>
<br>
I'll just say this much, I've never touched a hack in my life (dead serious) but if I wanted to I could link you to about 4 different free source engine hack clients (that have multiple duty for CSS/TF2/HL2DM) that still bypass VAC almost a year later.<br>
<br>
<br>
It goes ESEA Client &gt; CMN &gt; Wire &gt; EAC &gt; KAC &gt; punkbuster &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    VAC, VAC is pathetic</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just some observations over the years of CSS and hl2dm about cheaters;<br>
<br>
1) They deny it until the bitter end, in fact most of the time continue to deny even after getting caught, saying it was a third party audio program or something that triggered it.<br>
<br>
2) They stick with eachother and back eachother up like some sort of secret alliance or guild<br>
<br>
3) Somehow, in a way I cannot comprehend they feel like using the aid of a program is just fine, completely defeating the purpose of competition. Its no longer your god given skill vs anothers human god given skill, its just AI computer + you vs natural talent.<br>

Not saying you cheat or anything, but why do you keep saying you never cheated/hacked in a match? It makes me think that you are somewhat admitting that you have cheated/hacked just messing around in pubs. Are you admitting that you have done that? Just curious.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Confused played that game for so many years and got good at it, really freaking good at it. We trained together a bit and i couldn't beat him at all or dominate him for a second, the guy is just too good.<br>
<br>
Me i fucked up. I admitted everything, i cheated and i lied and i ruined leagues. Confused is nothing but a legit player who has really good skills in gaming. Not only that he is phenomenal in DM, but you should see him in css.<br>

Im just trying to say that im the cheater here, everyone knows it. I may not be cheating nowadays but still, you guys see me as a cheater. Confused is not a cheater, i can promise you that.<br>

*One more thing, im pretty sure everyone does not know this, LUA gets you banned now, VAC ban. I did my research and to play on a secure server you need a bypasser and this gets you banned , 100% of the time. LUA still works yes, but only if you play on insecure servers.

I saw nothing of value in confused's responses so I'll go ahead requote and bold a valuable lesson I've learnt over 6 years of competitive gaming and cheaters. Oh and zeik, I just kind of autoignore your terrible posts now, all you do is defend cheating/exploiting and are even proud of it.

hey guys, since not many people play the game anymore, and it was just a scrim, it's alright for him to hack.<br>

There's a hierarchy in Canada, I've learned this from CSS. The regular Canadians look down on the French Canadians because they tend to cheat more then the average player, and the French Canadians likewise think they are superior to regular Canadians because of their French ancestry tend to keep out regular Canadians from their clans. <br>

<br>
So you cheated, as far as hacking goes the last few demos I saw of you exhibited some what seemed to be a form of an aimbot I've encountered many times before (not getting into it). That's just IMO, nobodies elses opinion. Either way you're banned from eFPS so what does it matter.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I would like your help with these two threads I made on the steam forums.  Do not just post ASAP, give it some time so the threads stay near the top for some time.  If someone just posted, wait a day or two and then post.  Remember to stay positive and not feed any of the trolls that are surely to bite and post in both threads.<br>
<br>
<br>
So I have made two posts on the steam forums to try and get some help from valve for hl2dm.<br>
They can't spend and time or money on the game that doesn't bring in any money but if we provide the content maybe they will take a minute or two to review our stuff, and add it.<br>
<br>
First is just the steam store page, which is lacking of any good SS's or Video's of the game.<br>
<br>
I charge this community to post some of the best looking SS's of hl2dm on this thread I made.  Also a cool video, now the video can't really be a clan video or even a community video.  So we may need to work together to make a nice trailer for hl2dm.   Even if valve does not add this content to the store page.  it would still be helpful to have this stuff so everyone can spread positive content about the game.<br>

<br>
Second,  is a thread I made to try and get out the maps that we have made.  If we can get a collection of all of the maps that placed top 3 in the mapping contest zipped together and posted in this thread.  <br>

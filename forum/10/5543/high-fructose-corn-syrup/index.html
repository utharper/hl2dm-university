I think it's important to be aware and change shit up when we realize something's bad for, us but making it sound like the end of the world is pretty " meh ". <br>
<br>
Especially when you look back and not so long ago smoking was encouraged and all that stuff, yet, life expactancy has skyrocketed in a matter of years.<br>
<br>
And ultimately, with all the pills and treatments today, Cancer/HIV/whatever has an hard time killing us nowadays,<br>

LOL<br>
<br>
Inb4 the economy recovers, Obama gets relected, the tea party fracture the GOP and regains both houses in 2014 and leaves while the economy is in a boom.<br>
<br>
Or wait...the logical thing is Obama will destroy the United States and we have an apocolypse in 2012. Sorry guys didn't mean to get all weird on you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's because most people don't think long term. Empirically Obama's presidency from popularity ratings, to loss of congress to the economy situations mirrors Reagan and Clinton. The economy will begin to boom near the end of Q3 2011 and get him relected. That he has the popularity rating he does now is roughly the same as Reagan's at his same point of time, which is pretty good TBH.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Any "mirrors" of Reagan and Clit-on are superficial at best. There is hardly anything similar between now 1983 or 1992. And Obama is as knowledgeable and brilliant as High Fructose Corn Syrup, compared to Reagan OR Clinton.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

since hfcs isnt a natural product, your body doesnt break it down in the same way that is does with natural sugar. your liver cant process it. the extra fructose molecules are stored as fat instead of being broken down as energy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

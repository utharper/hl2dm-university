	<div class="content">ShootMania is a very fun game, though a bit difficult to get used to, especially coming from hl2dm. Its definitely slow, even though it is marketed as a fast-paced shooter. It does have its fast aspects, but its definitely not quake, or even unreal fast. Jumping basically gets you killed, but your sprint/jump is combined, so it takes a bit of thinking when and where to use it, which can be very frustrating for new players. Of course you can just do a small jump to make up for this, but can still leave you vulnerable. The movement is very frustrating when coming over from hl2, I think this will be the biggest hurdle for most players making the switch. Just remember, you've played hl2 for 5+ years, give this game a chance. <br>
<br>
In Elite Mode (The competitive one, IPL, ect.) team play is very important, at least when playing against organized players, or people who can aim well. PB and Grain's team is having good success, as everyone knows, weather you hate them or not, they are an excellent team, and communicate well, ect. Your shots really count, and positioning as well, so being organized makes all the difference in the world. There isnt really any spam, other than rockets (which dont do any kind of splash damage.) so this is another big thing to get used to coming over from hl2dm. (Especially you shotgun whores.) When you are the attacker, you have a near 3 second reload time, so this can be frustrating and hard to get used to.<br>
<br>
Overall I would say ShootMania is a great game, but try to not compare it to hl2dm, play it for what it is, and take some time to adjust. There is money in this game, so that can be another big allure. I see good things for this games future.<br>
<br>
Protip: Stay away from Royal mode, its been re-vamped for beginners, and is retarded. Just go straight into elite.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

+10 internet points for the detailed review. <br>
<br>
Honestly though, give it a solid five hours worth of gameplay. A lot of people from HL2DM have tried and dropped it because of the lack of bunny hop, but this isn't meant to be an arena deathmatch game. It's an entirely different experience that takes getting used to.<br>
<br>
p.s. - Viper, you're that sherman guy or whoever whom I spoke to yesterday, aren't you. DID I SOLVE THE RIDDLE?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Where did I fail? The only hackers caught in the US so far have used a general hack that has customizations for everything from where you can choose the area a shot lands to whether you have recoil or not. The hack that just increases shotty damage was a hack to make a player seem more discrete or unsuspicious has only been prevelant in Europe AFAIK.

<br>
Weird...oh how stories get twisted with word of mouth. I'm not about to spill the beans on who was making up the rumor you used a shotgun multiplier, he is the one the best players in Europe ATM tho. I watched your demo svN where you hacked against RaW, I have to say thats really scary you had an aimbot, I had an EXTREMELY MEGA ULTRA hard time seeing one or even two instances of an aimbot, I think my trust of who in this community is legit or not just went into complete ashes now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It was never vOz, it was always RaZ, he has like 10 different accounts and plays in different clans, is a proven hacker, and has done nothing but shun a dark shadow across our clan, only reason i kept my mouth shut is because when he joined, before we had knowledge of who he was, he straight away started paying for a hosted gameserver for us to play on, which was really nice and am thankful for that. Even though I'm sure he wasn't hacking when he was playing with us, me and Dark Soul had suspicion in a few scrims between only our clan when he just joined, mainly because he was firing an RPG then curving it straight into us from around corners when he could not have seen or heard us numerous times on a not very common map (dm_torque i think?), probably to let us think he was a very skillful player so he would stay.

Even though I'm sure he wasn't hacking when he was playing with us, me and Dark Soul had suspicion in a few scrims between only our clan when he just joined, mainly because he was firing an RPG then curving it straight into us from around corners when he could not have seen or heard us numerous times on a not very common map (dm_torque i think?), probably to let us think he was a very skillful player so he would stay.

You do realise that vid along with all the sound files were posted here about a year ago, none of the kills in that video were actually executed on me, lawl. I actually am becoming a midget though, I lost 6 kilos in the last 2 months and now look like a scumrat, thanks to smoking about 2 ounces of the same buds for that duration of time, yes you can call me midget soon, LOL not that I care.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As much as I hate deathwish for posting his pathetic ego-boosting challenge whineage all over the place, I don't think it's appropriate for these kind of thing to end up here.<br>
Deathwish should've been dealt with/warned a long time ago before turning these boards into  a 1v1  beggar valley and stuff like this could be avoided.<br>
<br>
Now i know everyone think i'm a forum nazi but it's fucking stupid that others in the past (sister, new guy...) got banned for similar bahavior and now it's alright because... idk... since there's no CAL and game is dead, hell let's turn it into 4chan #2?<br>

	<div class="content">i was banned for other reasons.<br>
<br>
my attacks were far more personal, admittedly out of hand at times and more often then not they were aimed at someone with (arguable) respect in the community. No one i ever raged on did anything other than inadvertently annoy me. Most of those people now refuse to even read these forums or they hide in some shadowy thread not granted the opportunity to bask in my sheer awesomeness.<br>
<br>
This kid is calling people out like its 03, every one of his posts screams attention deprived victim of grandfather molestation, and worst of all he's australian.<br>
<br>
it would be unfair to those people to squash the hate without 1 post resulting in a ban and a failed suicide attempt from deathwish.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

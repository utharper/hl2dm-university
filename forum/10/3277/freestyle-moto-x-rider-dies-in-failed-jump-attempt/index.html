Sad to say I knew this was going to happen sooner or later, these guys are pushing things way to far these days.<br>
As a former AMA motorcross racer I watched this sport explode near the end of my racing days back in the 90's and at that time simple tricks and huge gaps seemed risky enough, to see what they are doing today makes my head spin.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've completely come to terms with the fact that I will most likely die doing one of the extreme sports i do. I'm sure he wouldn't have rather gone any other way. It's still sad, however, for his family.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Anyway, likely he will be enjoying hl2dmu in read-only format after this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

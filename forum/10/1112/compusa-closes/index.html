	<div class="content">So if you have one near by get in there and grab some junk for 50% off. Things that never go on sale like Windows are nice catches. I missed the first day so I am sure all the good monitors are gone but I am hoping to snag some parts that the noobs don't know how to use.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I had something like this in the CompUSA Back home on meh island, they closed in like december and I got a decent headset for the computer back home. And they FINALLY opened a Best Buy in Puerto Rico.. Curious thing though.. Circuit City came to the island at the same time and I think both stores opened within the same month.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah I went in to day and must say don't bother to go. <br>
<br>
They shipped everything new and worth anything back to their online warehouse or something. Then the only thing good is floor models. If they say 60-80% off the max you will see is 60, they said something like excludes computers and electronics. Basically excludes everything in the store. And the final icing on the cakes was the very few things in the store worth anything all said sold to the same guy. So I figure the manager has picked all the good shit, put sold signs on it to stop customers from buying it and will purchase it on the last day when its 80-90% off. <br>
<br>
If anyone wants they can try to find me the company in charge of liquidation cause I would like to report that last item to them I am sure they would not be happy to know their liquidators are costing them thousands of dollars in corruption.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You're probably exactly right as I've personally seen this happen many times, and I think it's pretty bogus.<br>
<br>
And the liquidator in charge would be furious to say the least.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Compusa always sucked. Besides exorbitant outrageous prices, whenever i wnet there, there were always 3 or 4 red coated dorks yakking away and no help.<br>
The only one worth a damn was one of the techs, who would come out and chat tech with me or answer a question.<br>
<br>
Fatass slob of a manager, dorks everywhere, arrogant Apple saleman prick, high prices...<br>
F*ck Compusa!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i was watching a show called "i survived" last night and it made me think of near death experiences ive had.  was wondering if anybody here has had some really close calls.  <br>
<br>
ive had a few but i think the one i remember the most, and to this day i think about how i just shouldnt be alive.<br>
<br>
i was living on Martha's Vineyard for the summer with a college friend and my brother.  the 3 of us and a few friends from work were at a beach party.  on the way back me and my friend tony caught a ride with 2 guys from work.  the driver had a 2 seater pickup truck so tony and i sat in the back in the truck bed.  i was of course hammered and i dicided i wanted to stand up and lean forward with my hands on the roof of the truck cab.  the driver was drunk too and didnt realize i was standing up.  he took a really sharp right turn, the cintriphical force of the turn thru me to the left.  in a split second i reached down and was able to grab the little sliding window that some pick ups have and stopped myself.  thinking about it later, if his truck didnt have that window, if it wasnt open, or if i didnt manage to grab it i would certainly be dead, or would have a life altering brain injury.<br>
<br>
im really interested in hearing other ones from ppl.  post up.  i have a few other ones, but i wanna see what you guys have.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i was around 4 or 5 and was seated in the back seat of my dad's car next to my older brother and my grandmother. i was messing with the knob that keeps the door locked and since no one noticed what i was doing i managed to eventually open it and then went ahead starting to try and open the door handle. i got it and the door opened right when my dad took a strong turn left and i flew out. my grandmother grabbed me in mid air and saved my live.<br>
<br>
second instance was a near death altho it didn't feel like it at the time. it was during the first gulf was and as you know Israel was heavily bombarded by Iraq every day. the city that took the most hits was Ramat Gan and that's where at 17 i had a job at a rehearsal studio as a sound guy apprentice. i was left alone that day to work with a group that was rehearsing. since evening was when the bombs started falling they wrapped up around 5pm, and took off within 15 min. i should've finished folding the cabled, locking up and getting a bus back home but i took my time, i have no idea why, i guess i was just being too young and didn't feel scared. next thing i know the alarms went off and i was standing by the studio's wide glass window watching at dozens of bombs hit the city, lighting up the sky.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also the time I broke my arm got lucky with just a fracture because I fell on a sharp rock and woulda killed me if I hadn't put my arm in front. One time also getting bit by a poisonous snake or idk if it was near death but it sure gave me a he'll of a fever that lasted for a month.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sunroof and windshield shattered but somehow I only got one scar from the entire thing, on my hand. Jap cars4life now, thing had a WAY better body cage then I ever imagined, it basically kept me in a single position throughout the entire crash. How I didnt get more shards of glass cutting me IDK.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ah sheet. I remember when my friend (clinically diagnosed as bi-polar) asked us if we wanted to feel how it'd be to be in an action movie. He bought this junker car and took us out to this 10-15 foot hill and went over it at 80 MPH. When it landed one wheel fell off, all the axels were perm damaged and the engine blew smoke. Stupid thing was I think he knew it was gonna be totalled but forgot to mention the nearest sign of civilization was a redneck bar, good thing they thought our story was hilarious after seeing the car instead of beating our asses.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">One of my earliest memories was of England. I was 5 and my parents were in Spain. We had a baby sitter staying with us. Our next door neighbor had two sons, about 17 yrs. old. I walked through the walled arch of their patio besides the house because i heard some pounding. Chris, one of the sons has pounding on the end of a pipe. I asked him what he was doing and he told me to get out. He turn, struck the pipe with the hammer again and it exploded. I was about 25 feet away and it knocked me into the wall and blew an ear drum. It was ringing like crazy. Chris's midsection was pulp. I stumbled back out of there as neighbors ran to us. He died 20 minutes later right there.<br>
<br>
Car Wreck in 1978. I was doing a Quaalude so a friend of mine was driving my Plymouth Scamp. He ran a light and another car t-bone me on the passenger side. It knocked me through  the windshield, head first, leaving me half out of the car. My hard head came in handy. I was released later that day with huge stitches left top of my head.<br>
<br>
Early 1987, 2/502d Infantry Fort Campbell, i was in the last chopper of a stick doing an air assault at 300am. The Blackhawks' doors were open. There was a flash ahead of us. The first chopper had hit another scout out getting flight time. they collided and went down. One chopper hovered over with searchlights while the rest of us landed.<br>
Our blackhawk was one its side blades gone, and on fire. We dragged the pilot out, whose skull was crushed. Live rounds started cooking off and the grunts in back were trapped. 15 troopers died that night, including the other pilot and co.<br>
<br>
In a real eerie one, i was in the 1/8 Infantry, 8th Infantry Div (Mech) in Mannheim. on Dec. 22d 1988, i flew from Frankfurt Inter. on Pan Am flight 1??. My flight was a straight shot to Atlanta. The flight before us was a connector, landing in London. As i was in flight for Christmas, the other flight exploded over Lockerbie, Flight 103, killing 270 people.<br>
<br>
11 years old. Mass.  Some asshole broke into the house on a Sat. morning. Dad was gone. Stocking mask, hunting knife.<br>
Cut the Telephone wires and grabbed my mother and dragged her into the kitchen area. My Bro and Sis were hysterical. I took them out the front door to safety. We heard her screaming as we came around the house. She had elbowed him in the face and jumped through the screen porch into the garden. The demon freaked and fled through the woods.<br>
Not a good day. We left Mass for NC months later.<br>
<br>
Nassau. Drunk. Walked down the wrong alley one street too far. Jerk pulled a blade on me. I went into overdrive mode and scaled a 10 foot stucco wall. He just wasn't fast enough. Adrenaline is a good thing.<br>

The only thing I can share that would be near death would be from my very early childhood.  (From what I am told) I was 16 months old and had an ear infection accompanied by a 104 temperature.  I eventually went into convulsions and stopped breathing.  My mom started CPR on me and by the time the ambulance showed up I was breathing again.  I'm here and able to talk with you guys today thanks to her!  I would surely have been a goner otherwise.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Seriously though, this doesnt beat Impala but here goes anyway:  I gave blood for the first time ever when I was in college.  I dont like getting stuck, but Ive had blood samples taken or had shots many times and never ever had a problem.  Everything was fine until they took the needle out and I started raising my arm.  My sight started getting black from the edges out, kinda like going down a tunnel facing backwards real fast.  I said "Im blacking out, Im blacking out...."   They woke me up and I blacked out again right away.  They woke me up a second time and I stayed awake, but I felt real weak.  They said that my blood pressure had gone so low that they couldnt feel a pluse for a while.   They kept me there for over an hour til they were sure I was going to be OK.  They also said that I "should never give blood again"  (NO SHIT!).<br>

Well the story I related above was while mountaineering so maybe that counts? Otherwise I'd say the time my front tire sunk in biking down a hill of sand at about the 15 foot mark and I ended up taking a header from there into the ground, put an actual chip in the jaw of my full-face helmet, which probably saved my life, at least saved my jaw. =]</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

how much blood did you give FFS?</div></blockquote>

<br>
No more than normal, a pint, however I recall the bag filling rather quickly so that might have had something do with it.  There is no history of hemophilia in my family that I know of.   Could be my system just didnt like giving it up who knows.</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">Yea Ive never had a problem with seeing my blood going into a vial or seeing other people's blood.  I had to help a co-worker with a head wound once and holy crap you bleed alot from those!  There was blood everywhere.   I dont like getting stuck either and yea a tat is a bit different imo, that just does the skin, doesnt actually go into a vein.  Wait until you have kids.  My mom almost passed out watching a nurse take my blood once, not from the sight of the blood, but that it was me.<br>

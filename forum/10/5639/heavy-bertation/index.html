If you watch the left side of <span style="text-decoration:underline">her</span> face when she is talking and compare it with the right you can see her right muscles around her cheek bone functioning normally while her left side remains immobile along with a slight stiffness along her left corner of her lips are stiffened as well if you pause and see her face at seconds 6 and 7 you can see her dimple along her right while theres no movement on her left</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's really quite scary when you think about it...things are going fine then an instant later it changes for the worse.  Looked like it could have been a very minor stroke - but then no stroke is minor IMO and it could have been a lot worse.  Any word on her condition and what doctors came up with as a cause?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yep, that's what I heard this morning.  I used to suffer from severe migraines in the past but I don't recall being quite that incoherent - I suppose they can affect people in different ways.<br>

I used to meet her at the door and there were blankets over all the curtains to darken the house and she always had a cold towel on her head. She was a mess when she got these migraines.

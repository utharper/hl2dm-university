	<div class="content">I was curious if anyone could inform me on how to play sounds while in game? <br>
<br>
In my head I would like to thing its as simple as putting a sound file in the game directory and binding it to a key , like +voicerecord, but I would assume it would be different since thats for voice activation.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Not sure if this is what you want but it is possible to play the songs fom HL2 if you have HL2 that is.<br>
<br>
Someone called Mink came up with this music config I only added a way to bind the next song to a key.<br>
F9 = show song list<br>
F11 = start playing/ next song<br>
F12 = Stop<br>
Chenage the keys to your liking.<br>
<br>
place the 2 files into your cfg directory and type "exec ms_music_aliases" or bind it to a key for easy access.

<br>
I did the hlss thing.  I did not like it.  Ever since i put in it, my game crashes constantly, even when not trying to use songs.  I do not like the idea of 3rd party scripts in my game files I suppose.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There are several ways, but I think most use eventscripts for this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

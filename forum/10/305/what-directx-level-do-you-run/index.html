I play much better with dx8, it gives the textures a plain color, making it easy on my eyes and crosshair. ( Dx8 max settings ) <br>
<br>
Also alot more extra FPS. I don't play for the graphics, as the game isnt much graphic demanding.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Try upgrading your motherboards chipset. Judging by what you have told me before, its a non-connection related problem. <br>
<br>
BTW, whats your net_graph 3 output look like, post a screenshot, not just FPS.<br>
A very high input number ( 2X bigger than your FPS est.), usually means some hardware related problem. <br>
<br>
Some other good steps, would be to switch your ram slots around, even try running on one, if you have 2+. Upgrading to a new mboard, is good every 2 years or so too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah it has to be, I switched to cable 10 down 1 up. Net graph shows no loss or choke but still I lag like crazy, when I get into a confrontation it is like slow motion for me. There is often a delay from the time I press fire to the time anything actually fires, esp mag and RPG. HS don't register, but I sometimes get HS when I miss.<br>
<br>
Ug, my logitech keyboard display says I am using 50% CPU and 75% RAM when DM is running and not even playing. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"><br>

Dont go buy a new computer, all you need to do is buy a new motherboard, and a better FAN. Iam sure that will fix your problem. <br>
<br>
I bet your CPU is fairly old as well. You can get GREAT deals, from tigerdirect.com, for example get a quad core 2.4ghz for $250-300. Latest motherboards our there are only about $200. <br>
<br>
You can do a great upgrade for about $800 ( Getting almost the best hardware as well ). If your going to be spening time playing, it might as well be worth while !</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I run dx70 with a few major modifications- gibs arent allowed to show, decals are turned off and the 3dskybox is disabled. This still barely gets me 60+ fps on most maps, though its better than dx95, which sends my fps under 20, and as low as 5 or less during heavy explosions or action.<br>
<br>
Dx70 does have some major quirks- water is perfectly transparent from above, but far foggier underneath than in dx95. Props vanish at various distances if screenfade isnt prevented, and any map that relies even partially on specularity for lighting is very dark, sometimes to the point where i cant see a thing in certain places. Also, some textures appear fullbright, or messed up, and some animated textures dont appear at all. But, it beats playing at 20 fps.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>
<br>
Im really overdue for an upgrade.  :roll:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It basically deletes your config.cfg, and inverts your X-Y axis on your mouse somehow. So you will have to delete your config.cfg and restart the game, and reconfig all your settings all over.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

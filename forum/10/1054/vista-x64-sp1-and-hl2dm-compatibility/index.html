	<div class="content">This is a heads up for anyone who is thinking about switching to Vista x64.  Since the planned release of Service Pack 1 for Vista, MS has been talking about improvements in compatibility, I can tell you from personal experience that there has been no change in that respect.  I experienced at least a half a dozen game crashing issues that were present before and after the installation of Service Pack 1.  This still could be attributed to Valve's Source Engine in the way it handles resources, in fact I even had problems with the Orange Box Engine that ranged from instability after a few rounds to completely unplayable.  I also noticed that for the OBE, TF2 only runs in 32 bit mode. This could simply be because it wasn't designed that way.  What will be interesting for the upcoming update is whether or not HL2DM will still feature x64 support after OBE conversion, because modern games designed for Vista x64 like Crysis show definite performance gains.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

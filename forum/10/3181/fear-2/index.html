I totally recomend silent hill 2, its not an FPS its kind of RPG, as for the creepiness its the ambient sounds and music that does it, it is seriously weird and twisted it gives me shivers down my spine and makes my hairs stand up.  I have played silent hill 3 and 4 and neither gives the same creepiness.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok so i'm a big video game horror fan! I hate horror Films, ironic huh? but the games are great.<br>
Alone in the Dark 5 was not scary at all! Great graphics, pretty cool play.<br>
BUT, first game ever to scare me was Resident Evil.<br>
Then Resident Evil 2, probably as good if not better than the first, scary wise.<br>
But once games started getting better, playing those again these days probably wouldn't be as scared!<br>
Silent Hill was also one of those scary games, it was the first and probably the best!<br>
I absolutely love Silent Hill 2 though, it's just different than Silent Hill 1.<br>
So if anything, they're the same in my book. Cause without SH1, SH2 wouldn't be here today!<br>
I didn't get that far in SH3, and I have SH4 and SH5. I need to finish 3 first, then 4 and 5.<br>
I would have to say there hasn't been an FPS to scare me until FEAR came about.<br>
It was the first EVER, and i loved every minute of it. Great story delivery!<br>
Doom 3 was a little scary, but it was easy to overcome! It used the same scare tactic as Resident Evil.<br>
the "jump out at you and startle you to death" tactic.<br>
But seriously, if you really want an immersive experience of getting creeped out and feeling helpless<br>
you should definitely check out the Penumbra series. It's innovative, and fucking freaky.<br>
it uses sound like no other game out there. you really ought to have a headset when playing that game<br>
they even recommend a to use a damn headset. And to TURN out the lights, they recommend that too!<br>
cause man i tell you, i nearly shat myself plenty while trying to solve a time sensitive puzzle with <br>
weird creepy noises and things about, that you don't know whats going to happen to you if you don't get this right!<br>
PENUMBRA is by far the scariest FPS i've ever played! and i'm scared to go back and finish it!<br>

When you get to see the pattern in F.E.A.R *ie: you'll never hallucinate in a fight, if it's been awhile you havent shot anyone you'll start to see shit, you never get hurt while hallucinating* you just start blazing through without really caring.<br>

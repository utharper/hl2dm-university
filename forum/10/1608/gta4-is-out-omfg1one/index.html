<br>
i own a 360, brother has the ps3, but i got gta4 for ps3 (even tho i wont get it until tomorrow, fucken blockbuster) so i could play online for free, xbox and its $60 a month so you can match up with 12year olds shit is gay.<br>
<br>
but the greatest thing about the ps3 is backwards compatibility, i've got like 20 years worth of games that i can play on it, or download and install on my psp and play on the go.<br>
<br>
and the only thing exclusive to the 360 worth playing is dead rising (and crackdown i guess, which i've been enjoying this last week in my need for gta4) halo 3 was a waste of money, it plays bioshock nicely, but not nearly as good as my pc would with a few upgrades.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Consoles = Meh<br>
<br>
I would much rather sink my $$ into upgrading my multifunctional PC then having to purchase a new console every 3 years because the one I got 3 years ago is now a useless plastic paperweight.  And for most of them (except PS3 I gather) you have to repurchase all the damn games again.  Also new games for xbox cost like $60-$75 as comparied to $40 to $50 for PC and if you wait a bit you can get it for $20-$30 for those games you just dont have to have the minute they come out.<br>
<br>
I always come back to DM anyway so I don like to spend alot on new games.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

not true, walmarts been known to hold product to coincide with local advertisement, like the wii (could give a shit less about it tho) not only that but if you sell something before its release date they could get in troubles.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

$700?? Who's selling it for that price? I bought my PS3 for $399 + tax...ok sure its only the 40gig version but I could care less about that. I own both systems and they are both great. Paying to play on line though is gay...anyway...GTA4 owns...fantastic game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The game is hilarious, we were cappin peoples tires and watching them speed off on rims.  Driving super fast just to crash and fly out the windshield, smashing into unfortunate people, the funniest hit was when I took someones car, got in, the driver chased after me, I was going slow enough to lead him all the way down the street, he caught up, grabbed onto the door handle, I sped up, he was literally hanging onto the handle for about 3 seconds before smashing into a light pole and flying backwards.  GTA is the greatest because of all of the little stuff in it, like people crashing into eachother in the background, in the cut scenes, and people screaming as loud as they can when you turn a corner  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>

	<div class="content">Dude, everyone has <em class="text-italics">those thoughts</em> sometimes right<strong class="text-strong">?</strong>  Isn't it in human nature to &gt;Have Thoughts&lt; about being absolutely relentless and causing destruction to anything that they don't own?  Well this game is putting me in control unlike any other game I've played  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"> <br>
<br>
I went across the street to get something to drink after playing the game for hours, and there was SO MUCH POTENTIAL!  Everywhere I looked, I was like 'WTF, This is GTA!!!!', cars were going by and I was thinking..  "Holy shit, they are just waiting for me", the store itself, houses, even the damn weather..<br>
<br>
Now I'm 100% aware of morality and consequence, but don't tell me I can't think what I think  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> and I don't want people to confuse this with one of those 'Video games causing kids to kill eachother' bullshit, that's mostly due to parents leaving it up to other people (school, friends, etc) to raise their children..  Just want to make that clear, GTA4 is not using me to do bad things  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> Those thoughts were pre-existing, it's always fun to have the worst case scenarios played out while you're doing something isn't it?  Doesn't it help out in the long run, and make things overall interesting?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> Now if I was watching someone ELSE cause that much Khaos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24n77GgRtrw" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24n77GgRtrw</a>) I'd open up a beer and throw my fist in the air, so long as I'm safe to watch it  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> <br>
<br>
All I'm saying is the game is THAT REALISTIC to me, the game is a perfect metaphor for every thing going on around here..  Rockstar North never ceases to motivate me  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
BTW shoot some pigeons w/ the gat on the annihilator heli, it's hilarious.<br>
<br>
One last thought:  Does anyone else love how random and dynamic the background gameplay is?  Like, you start a mission, and right as the cut-scene begins, some huge ass van slams into the back of a police car, and Niko and whoever just keep walking as if nothing happened  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">, or people shooting at eachother for reasons oblivious to you.  I killed a man in the middle of the road, cop didn't see, he came up in his car and stopped in front of the body on the ground, I was just standing near watching, the cop then alternates between gas and brake very slowly, as if the guy was going to get up and walk out of the cops way, then without warning, the cop just lays on the horn, then another vehicle gets close to the back of the cop car, then WITHOUT WARNING THE COP JUST SPEEDS OFF DOWN THE ROAD RUNNING THE GUY RIGHT OVER!<br>

I remember in Vice city, I'd always shoot out all 4 tires before getting in the taxi to redo a mission, the taxi would sputter about 5 feet ahead then the scene would just fade out xD  @ fade in the same shit would happen, brake all sideways in the grass, I havn't tried that yet in 4, I guess most of them would just speed off right at gunfire.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

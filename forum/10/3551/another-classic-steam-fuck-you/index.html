	<div class="content">so idk if any of you look at the game promotions steam has, but last week they had this deal going on with Ubisoft, where each day they sold a game for 50% off, making the current day's game anywhere from $9-$20ish(i cant recall the exact prices) now here's the big fuck you part.  when the weekend came steam put ALL the games together in a pack deal for $9.99. yes, ALL of them for $9.99.  meaning if you took part in any of the 50% of deals during the week you paid the same if not more then you would have if didnt take part in their week promotion and waited until the weekend.  WTF is that all about?  only steam would promote some deal and then fuck over anybody who took part in it, by offering a much better deal to those who ignored it all week long.  claps all around for steam on another wonderful fuck you to the community</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Steam has never been very talented with maths.<br>
<br>
It's not the 1st time they fuck some communities with the prices. In the past in Europe we were paying our games in $. So if it was 50$ we were paying 50/1,3253 €. Now they have decided that 1$=1€ (lol) and we pay 50€... Fucked !<br>
<br>
And now fucked again with their new "offers" you are describing...<br>

Disappointing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

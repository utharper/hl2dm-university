	<div class="content">Anyone pick it up? So far it's completely amazing for me, the singleplayer story is in-depth on the tier one operators war against the taliban, completely realistic gunshot noises, not to mention completely realistic gameplay. I mean, for 60 dollars, it's completely worth it, and I got the beta for Battlefield 3 (which I really don't see why theres a point in making that, MoH is battlefield x100).<br>
<br>
Go get it if you enjoyed battlefield, or hell, go get it if you wanna have a great time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I won't be buying this. Not matter how they put it 4-5 hours single player campaign is not worth shelling out £30-£40. Not to mention the multiplayer does not really appeal to me it lacks depth that is needed to invest 50+ hours of my time. I would of preferred them to focus on the single player and completely avoid multiplayer. <br>
<br>
I think COD:BO is going to blow this out of the water.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It looks good but 4-5 hours of sp won't do. Is it really that short!?<br>
The originals were never that hot in my book.<br>
I'm not up on what folks WILL be playing, so maybe i'll pass. Have just a little to blow on gaming.<br>
<br>
I did feel like the Beta graphics were blurry and confusing. Combat - vision, especially at those altitudes is clear and crisp. You can see far in the mountains. There is little to discern enemy from foe.<br>
Not very inspiring.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, since I can't play hl2dm atm, I tried Medal of Honor. The sound effects were amazing, the cut scenes were pretty well done. The game itself isn't half bad, but it was a lot like the already existing BC2. I really like that it was based on true events, that made the single player mean more to me knowing it was based off real situations and people. What blew it for me was the 5 hour single player, all the damn annoying INVISIBLE WALLS, the crappy team mate AI, the crappy enemy AI, and the single player missions were all extremely linear. You were pretty much a rat going through a maze with no free choice of where to go at all. Multi player only has like 8 maps, and is pretty dense, but fun. <br>
<br>
I was really hoping for more. It looks like Black Ops will have more to offer in multi player with every match being automatically recorded and an in game camera editor, a better single player experience that is longer than 5 hours (hopefully) and Black Ops just seems to bring more to the table. More bang for your buck. <br>
<br>
Medal of Honor doesn't bring anything new to the Military fps, everything it brings has already been done before. That's my 2 cents.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah Ill admit I bought it even though I said I wasnt going to but my clan mates all got it and well, I wanna play with them.  Its much better than the beta.  Its definately a different sort of game that requires some thinking and tactics.  All run and gun doesnt cut it.  It also doesnt have the nade spam that you can see in COD with their 3x frag nade perk.<br>
<br>
It does have a bit too much spawn camping and sniper camping for my taste and full 24 slot server gets retarded for that.  However a server with 8-16 people is alot of fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I ask as I run in DX8 but have a DX 9 card so everytime I load up my own preferences on these go back to default.  Only a minor annoyance but it does stop me from jumping straight on a server through Steam without loading up first.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You can't, I know this for a fact, because you can't set the brightness level to anything else but default on dxlevel 80, I've had the same issue a while back, when you change it back to dxlevel 90, you will be able to... If you are running dxlevel 90, just make your config.cfg not read-only, boot up your game, go into your Video Setting, alter the Brightness level to what you want it to be, quti the game and make your config.cfg read-only again. As far as I know there is no command in your config.cfg that's directly connected to the Brightness level. As for dxlevel 80, all the above can't be done, you can try it, but it won't work... Only solution is to change the value everytime you start hl2dm... As for your resolution, same problem occurs, very weird, I assume your running 800x600 at the moment?<br>
Why force a lower dxlevel though if your card can handle a higer level?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I'm running at 1024 X 768.  The reason I force the lower Dx Level is because I have an NVidia 8800 card running in XP.<br>
<br>
There's an issue with the drivers (fixed in Vista) which causes character models to fog and I also find it increases the intensity of the red screen that flashes when you get hit.  Nothing worse than being tagged or missing because basically you can't see.<br>
<br>
A few of us have this issue and have just found its not as bad running in DX8.<br>
<br>
I've only just heard this morning that there may be a new set of XP drivers out but not checked them out yet.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No problem, mate. I know I reduced my resolution to 800x600, and decreased my dxlevel to 80, to get better fps, but the difference wasn't mind blowing and actually did more damage then good, in regards of my gameplay... So I'm back on playing with dxlevel 90 and 1024x768... It's done a small miracle for my magnum .357 aim again actually.<br>

	<div class="content">It's quite bizarre in a way, decent video card and running in DX8!  I actually upgraded from an X800XT and have effectively lowered my graphics!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  <br>
<br>
Thankfully I can now see what I am aiming at in close battles now although it would be nice if Valve or NVidia sorted it.<br>
<br>
Even if it was by EP2 I'd be happy as I recently played a bit of EP1 again and it looks awful with the fogging  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

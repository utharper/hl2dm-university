	<div class="content">My cousin and uncle went over there 3 days ago for a karate tournament for my cousin. My aunt finally received an email around 6 am PST this morning.<br>
<br>
I was on the phone from about 3-5 trying to connect to the hotel, I got through twice, but the system was so bad that everything the lady was saying was echoing about 5 seconds after she said it the first time so it was extremely hard to hold a conversation, especially since English was her second language. <br>
<br>
But thankfully my cousin and uncle were okay, they had to walk 8 miles back to their hotel from a mall they were at,; they were on the 6th floor of a mall while the quake was going on. On their way back they stopped at a convenient store to get lunch but all that was left was beer and gum.<br>

Same here, watched the events in real time, thinking the whole time "this can't end well".<br>

However Japan has already released the quake bots and the country already looks 100% unaffected.<br>

Instead of fixing them, they santion you? LOL.<br>

Then, let's have a Steam game for free everytime my 'hl2.exe' gets crashed :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Boo hoo.  The worst part about it is the scout update this week.  They won't get to play with those upgrades for a month <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its still a poor decision. If somethings available in the game, without external hacks or dll/exe edits etc, players should not have to guess as to whether or not its intended, or if its a feature or an exploit. Also, valves so blank about their games that often a major bug going public is the only way itll get fixed. Punishing players because valves bugfinding / fixing skills are subpar is a sorry path to take, to say the least.<br>
<br>
And that said! I hope they do exactly the same for all those who have used i51. Sure, itd probably ban half the games player base from [whatever] for a month, but at least the fricken bug would finally be fixed. Its been active what now, almost 2 years? And not one peep of an impending patch. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>You Have Failed Me<br>
February 18, 2009 - TF Announcer<br>
<br>
It saddens me that despite my best efforts to instruct and better you, some of you insist on finding new ways to fail.<br>
<br>
We have sounded the alert and released a quick fix for an exploit that some unscrupulous players were using to wield items on invalid classes. I have considered an appropriate punishment for the good-for-nothings responsible for this horrendous breach of conduct. Death, of course - but death is too good for disappointments such as these. Instead, their unlockable items have been removed for a month.<br>
<br>
To the majority of you who did not see fit to cheat, you have my congratulations: I await the countless other ways you will inevitably disappoint me in the future.<br>
Yours,<br>
TF Announcer</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

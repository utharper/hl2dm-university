This. If you can, tell them you'll change, but you want the same IP. Lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No, Gameservers, which I believe is what WA is, has sales on servers every now and then.  Sometimes they have sales on servers in particular locations.  It doesnt matter which game you choose, its the same price pers slot.  COD4 costs the same as HL2DM, it has nothing to do with the game's popularity.  Sometimes a game that requires more out of a server, such as L4D costs more per slot.  L4D servers were more expensive when they first came out, not sure now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Let me guess, GameServers.com?  I just went through that with them.  Was paying $24/month for the Litterbox server and noticed they had a sale which would allow me to pay $12/month.  In the past they had given me the sale price but this time they stuck to their guns and insisted that I either pay the original amount and keep the same IP or that I get the sale price but get a new IP.  I told them that neither was not acceptable to me and pointed to their past history of working with me on price when they had sales.  I never got another response.  Instead they canceled the server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Okay, well, Frank put plenty of time into his server idleing it. Whenever I was looking for a game, I'd look for Frank's name. Of course, there he was, idling the server. He doesn't sit empty because he put time into it. They are sitting empty because nobody is putting time into them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Gameservers use linux, I find Linux based servers have odd timings for grenades and weapon switches, most of the time I tend to suicide more on Linux servers than Windows servers when grav 'nading. I prefer playing on Windows dedicated servers for this reason and also Valve are less likely to fuck up a patch they releaese for windows servers,  does anyone remember the slow crowbar and no chat bugs on linux servers only?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Personally, I haven't noticed any differences between linux and Windows servers per se. I've seen bad/poor performing servers of both OS.  Usually has to do with the number and types of mods/addons they have <br>
crammed onto the server or the network itself.  I've used GS for 3 years with very few problems</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

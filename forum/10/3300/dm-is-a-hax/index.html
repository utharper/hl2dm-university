Thats an odd assumption to make considering the guy who made it made air acceleration and the like very similar to the quakes, and quake being one of teh originals as it was, and as popular as it was.... one could assume the guy who was responsible for hl2dm was a fan of ... not to mention the massive differences between single play hl2 and hl2dm(in regards to movement).<br>
<br>
In my opinion, bunnyhoping in hl2 is NOT an exploit, though even most of the valve staff themselfs probably wouldnt realise that, assuming im right, and i do assume im right, cause it just makes alot more fucking sense <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>

	<div class="content">lectroburn is in the uk now, he actually moved in to my place a couple of weeks ago. he's got a thing about sleeping on couches lol. Though he is playing on a laptop with no graphics card.  <br>
<br>
well started off playing with some guys from a clan called biffer while i was picking up the game again but that stopped being a challenge pretty quickly as i got back up to speed. sort of hanging around with the raw guys now and they are giving me tips and pointers which are defo helping my movement, we all know my bhoppin was never great but my aim was always there. there all pretty damn good players so hopefully once i get good enough and improve my movement ill be able to play for them.<br>
<br>
Australia has some 1337 players (you, noobles,  pincus, sod, bain, ads, crowie etc) but the scene is just too small there was about 20 of us at a decent level for the whole country and lack of servers doesn't help. I still cant believe how many people play in Europe its crazy, though it is good to be in a competitive scene again. <br>

	<div class="content">yeah I was in a clan with this dude.  He was a lot different then, than when I first met him (annoying, spam messages bout shit I dont care, like his godliness).  I liked confused.  <br>
<br>
I also recall him bragging about getting paid to do lans and winning cevo crap or whatever.  I said, wow, cool man.  Never played the game.<br>
<br>
Any event, bye confused.  Whatever respect you had is gone man, I'm sure that goes for a lot of the community.  To lie about something that big and to have a clan of hateful people that especially dislike you, did you not realize someone would look in to it??   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  <br>
<br>
g gun scripts anyone?   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>
<br>
I'm not entirely sure how scripts work in a game, but I recall a time when me and him were on ldr3.  He says "brb, I need to alt-tab something something"  <br>
<br>
"ok"<br>
<br>
rachkir pulls out AR  - launchs fast orb feet from his back  - turns and catches it....???????<br>
<br>
seconds later he says, wow I dont even know how I caught that.<br>
<br>
yeah man, thought u were alt -tab.  <br>
<br>
came back in time<br>
<br>
so u alt-tabbed for like 5 seconds?  does the game even minimize and load desktop and back into game in that time?<br>
<br>
good computer<br>
<br>
wtf?  can someone clarify how a g gun script works so I can determine if he was full of shit or not.  I let it go at the time cuz I didnt understand scripts and how their used in games and I was in the clan.  <br>
<br>
I bring this up only cuz he's fucking done.<br>
<br>
Zman----- do you remember me asking you about this???  I think I even asked Tiggy too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
still not an explanation on g gun scripts though.<br>
<br>
I either assumed they are executed with a bind, and stay on, or u need to hit a key that activate the script everytime.  dont know. just curious.  <br>
<br>
thanks for the lawls at me asking a question...<br>

why are you still in the kitchen?<br>
<br>
and I'm starting to  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry">  cuz no one likes me in this community of 50 people. damn.  You do realize a lot of people here are the reason why this game is dead dont you??  Not talking bout noobs coming into the game, I'm talking how like 75% of the people who post here dont even play the game anymore.  lol.  It's like a bunch of mini social clicks and sometimes they hate each other, sometimes they wont play in a server with one another, blah blah blah.  Either you are awesome and rape so no one will play, or you/clan sucks and you end up quiting.<br>
<br>
and then were left with wut we have now. nothing.  <br>
<br>
sounded better in my head.  let the flames ignite.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Confused should get his fair chance to post demos and prove us all wrong, maybe he was aliased in one of the winning teams (LOL). Go to the athletic center to ask for advice, Confused doesnt hack, he's not that great and one of the least potential candidates to be a hacker in this game in the upper tier of players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The only grav gun scripts I have ever seen, just execute a series of actions like all scripts. So basically you have to push a button to activate the script, its pulls out your grav gun and starts trying to catch anything in range. It doesn't work that good most of the time and more times than not would grab a radiator (or anything else) laying on the floor instead of a orb.<br>
Confused was always good with the grav gun for as long as I've known him, I doubt its scripts or hax.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

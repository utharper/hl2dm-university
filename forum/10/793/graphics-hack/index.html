	<div class="content">Okay, I was on a pub server yesterday and the strangest thing happened.  I stumbled into a secret room with plenty of ammo, weapons and such.  Another player knew I was in the room and bombarded me with rpg's and orbs.  Didn't work.  But then, the walls in the room changed into a caricature of George Bush.  All the graphics on the rest of the map were messed up.  I couldn't even read chat due to the distortion.  I didn't think to take a jpeg or make a demo, I was too concerned that this thing was a virus or something that could harm my already poor system.  So I just closed everything down, ran virus scan, and rebooted.  Everything appears to be clean and back to working normally.<br>
<br>
Anyone ever hear of such a thing?  Is this something I should be concerned about?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'll have to go back to that server and look at the map rotation to figure out the exact map.<br>

It's a newish {TBA} Server 24/7 Wal Mart.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They were possibly annoyed you were camping a secret. I wouldn't worry about it...just some nub admin being an ass.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I thought so too WT.  But he wasn't on the server as far as I could tell and he denied it when I asked him about it.  Could've been another person with admin authority I suppose.  Or a spray hack?  hmmm.  Dunno.<br>

If I could have read the chat after it happened, maybe I'd know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Huh that certainly is very weird.  I used to play those 24/7 walmart servers to practice with the rpg and never encountered any such problem.  Granted they were older maps so this new one I have never played...might be a mpa problem or something.  But mallicious admin trying to pull some trickery seems like the most likely reason for all that crazy graphical stuff.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I once ran a server with an old version of Mani. When HL2DM updated it freaked out. Every time you killed someone it would ask you to select a punishment. You couldn't do anything until you voted. Once you clicked something it would set that person on fire or drug them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

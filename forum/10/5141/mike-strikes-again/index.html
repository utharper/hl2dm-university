	<div class="content">The solution for this is quite simple really. Nothing will be done on valve's side to fix this until it becomes a problem, and theres only so much the community can do about patching this on it's own.<br>
<br>
IF this server crash thing works in CSS or TF2  (wich are valves most popular games) make sure everyone knows about it, it will be an unplayable living hell for about 2 weeks then watch a patch appears. Both players and unhappy server hosting provider are going to be on valve's back about this security flaw.<br>
<br>
I cant imagine both CSS and TF2 servers crashing constantly because of simple users with nothing done about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So... <br>
<br>
What Connie is saying is for newguy and other people (who are of like-troll-mind) to get this plug-in on alias accounts and go on a crashing spree in TF2 and CS:S. <br>
I'd be will to pay $40.00 to troll on other accounts and do this, but I will never put anything non-legit and/or shifty on my real account. <br>
That is just how I personally am, but others need to do this too; it can't just be me out there.<br>
<br>
Just wild crashing and faggotry people. GO!<br>
<br>
Question is: will Valve patch everything BUT hl2dm?<br>
Chances are that is how it will turn out, but that won't stop me from being a huge ass in shitty games only brain-dead people think are "pr0." <br>
<br>
This idea will probably just turn out like the various civilian recycling programs and "freedom-gardens"  during WWII; we wont be directly responsible for influencing any sort of outcome, let alone the one we want (a patch,) but it is fun and will boost morale. Even though I do find this game shitty, people crashing Frank's servers non-stop does piss me off.<br>

	<div class="content">New guy is right. even if Valve patches TF2 and CSS (and BTW CSS has been suffering from this for a good while now and no updates..) HL2DM will not be patched.<br>
the only solution is to have the following lines in your server.cfg<br>
<br>
sv_allow_wait_command "0"<br>
sv_allowupload "0"<br>
.<br>
.<br>
and install the new KAC plugin</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Bingo, impressed you drew those conclusions by yourself. Wherever we are in relation to the anticheat measures, the CSS community has been there and done that almost 2 years ago compared to the HL2DM community.<br>
<br>
See DAF plugins if someone is only concerned about DOS blocking measures.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nah not sarcasm.<br>
<br>
I assume rcon spamming is clientside so yes, either KAC or DAF would block it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Post all the bugs you find. REAL BUGS. None of this "speed crawling is fuuucked!" shit as that is not a bug. Once everyone feels the list is proper, Ill email it to Mike Durand of Valve, who is in charge of the sdk code. Ill use ghostdogs post over on the steam forums as a platform and he can use this one as well so the lists are the same and Valve can confirm both lists from there and the one I send. All bugs need to be confirmed by more then one player to make this list.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">Too many vertex format changes in frame, whole world not rendered</strong><br>
I get this error filling my console and my game runs like a slideshow when I move, not when standing still using mouse look. -ghostdog(needs confirmed)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Crouch/sprint delay</strong><br>
It is a bug with sprinting after you leave a crouch. Stop crouching / press sprint and it makes the sprint noise but dosn't increase your speed. (confirmed)<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Shotgun reload bug is still present</strong><br>
If you reload the shotgun, switch to another weapon and then switch back to shotgun the reload animation glitches(confirmed)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't agree that the players should have to adjust the way that they move because of this update. Not being able to sprint from crouched is a major inconvenience for anyone that bhops and Valve should fix this issue.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah the strafe jump delay isnt a bug. Its a fix I believe.  I think it's related to the fix for the speed crouching bug, so that one is removed from teh list. Ive also removed the physics juggling for now until more info is presented. It is possible that it is also a fix via Orange Box engine. People are gonna have to realize that the new engine doesnt have any of the old bugs and glitches and a lot of things considered "normal" were not. There are certainly some bugs, but most of the chatter is based on update shock.<br>

I wouldnt call it a sprint issue as I can hold in the sprint key and it works just fine lol. This is probably more of a "want" then a bug. It is quite possible that it boils down to speed crawling being an exploit and perhaps the bhop issue was also a part of that exploit. It is technically fixed now since the engine prevents it. So, technically, it isnt a bug. It is more of a removal that needs added back in.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Then they're missing out because hitreg is 100x better along with dozens of other bugs fixed. <br>
Hey for all I know crouch sprinting could have been part of why hitboxes were so f'ed up in the first place.<br>
I'll still play, I'm loving all of the little things like the fixed burning animation on barrels and not getting stuck on lifts.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sprint has worked like that for the majority  the game has been released now it doesnt work and hasnt worked for 2 days It hink tis safe to say that is not normal, also it is possible to have sprint as it used to be i.e activated when you let go of duck and still not enable vent sliding. AG2 worked like this in 1.0, 1.02 added back the vent slide.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I highly doubt Valve went in and said " we gotta fix this whole speed crouching exploit at any expense" and then proceeded to do so at the expense of the sprint function because speed crouching was such a huge exploit that needed fixing. This is nothing more than a quick port over to OBE that created several things people were not expecting nor wanting to happen, things Valve likely does not even care about nor are likely to fix in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Sub Zero has been working on his OBE mod for a long time now, taking community input the whole time and continues to listen and refine his mod to suit what this community wants to this day.<br>
<br>
WTF is wrong with all of you? Who even cares what Valve is doing at this point? Valve will never listen to the competitive community and respond with fixes that we want in a timely matter, so why even bother with them when we have someone who has made a mod that has addressed every issue this community has ever brought up.<br>
<br>
Valve just killed the game for good with this update, I do not ever expect them to fix it the way we want and thats not just a pessimistic view it's reality.<br>
<br>
It's time to move on people, if you want to play the game we love you all are going to have to play a mod and not valves POS port over crap. I mean seriously no alpha nor beta, no input from the players, no response to what people have stated since the update released what else would you expect from Valve when they dont care about a game.<br>
<br>
Support Sub Zeros mod  and have the real thing plus real support.<br>

Obviously this messes pepople up that go to strafe jump after an overbounce/asshop, or crouch jump over a railing etcetc. But to try and put it into perspective for all you people that don't use advanced movement...<br>
After you've been crouched in a corner with your pistol out pro css style, you get your super awesome pistol headshots then you wanna run on to the next corner... After you stand back up sprint will fail to work. Needs a fix imo.</div></blockquote>

Why? Because Im being comepletely unbiased? I dont like no speed crouch either. It completely ruins my movement. I just wanna see more info on it before adding it.

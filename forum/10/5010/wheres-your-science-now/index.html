i'm not saying this is Noah's Ark but this is a silly argument. and what does religion got to do with anything? of course religion fails doh but that's not the point. this may be a significant relic in human history that if anything, reaffirms the occurrence of a great flood some 3000 years ago. nothing more.<br>

<br>
IMO the bible etc.. is all about philosophy.<br>
<br>
Just look back not even 100 years back, most stories were fables.<br>
(The Tortoise and the Hare etc..)<br>
<br>
You have to read between the lines, and the message the bible or any "holy writings" for that matter, is always more or less pointing in the same direction.<br>
<br>
There are truths worth spreading in such fables and their writers are geniuses. A story will sound like a fabulous fairytale for someone that simply reads it quickly, while it is also keeper of deep messages and lessons in life.<br>
<br>
There was not really an arranged race between a turtle and a hare.<br>
However the story teaches you to get shit done and be serious about everything you do even if you deem the task easy.<br>
<br>
There was not really a giant fucking boat holding 2 of every animals on earth.<br>
However,when facing dark times, one must make his priority to save the knowledge of man and the life on earth.<br>
<br>
Read between the lines in anything you read and hear, question what is given to you, only then will you evolve and move on.<br>
<br>
Or stick to what been writen and folow it without questioning a thing and live in the comfort of the dream you chose to live in. <br>
<br>
I don't make any difference between the matrix and the bible when it come to interpreting what is said in the given media.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is how I see it. What they should really focus on, is finding out how this wrecked ships or pyramids can last so long. We're traveling in space but can't build anything that lasts more than 30 fucking years, miserable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">As a real-life Christian who majoried in philosophy and is now in law school, I think I'm about as even-minded as most people. You don't have to read the Bible as completely literal in order to be a good Christian. When you compare the Torah (the first and earliest books of the Bible) with many other religious texts of the same period, they all have in common a flood myth and a story of creation. But the flood myth is just that - a myth. Everyone who thinks about the Noah's Ark story has determined that a boat large enough to support 40,000 - 1.5 million species just couldn't exist, especially not in that era. Believers are quick to point out that maybe God did some funky shrink-ray stuff. Maybe he did - God is God after all. But apart from some miraculous God-work, we're just left with a fable about a guy and a boat. <br>
<br>
Christians have to get past the science vs. religion war, IMO, in order to be taken seriously in educated socieites. And that clearly involves taking real-life scientists out on your fundamentalist expeditions.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i say again. Tora is a single book. Bible is a collection of books. read from the wiki <blockquote class="uncited"><div>"...The Torah is the first of three parts of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible).."</div></blockquote>
Tora is NOT the Mosaic book<span style="text-decoration:underline">s</span> of the Christian Bible. you got it wrong. The Tora has nothing to do with Christianity. absolutely nothing at all.<br>
<br>
heh, not only Jewish politics raped history for their own ends but also Romans and then later Christians came in and further raped the facts.<br>
<br>
and to the point: Religion is buttnuggets. always was. always will be. there were people in human history who here enlightened, or..very inspired if you will. NONE of them told ANYBODY follow me - i'm the shit. Hell is in your Mind and Heart...right next to Heaven and this is the same old things ALL the prophets kept saying over and over again. Some religions were better at hiding this essence. Hardcore Jews and Roman Catholics take first place. followed by Muslims.<br>
<br>
Point of this thread is: are there proofs of ancient historic events found on whatnot scrolls, books, teachings or not? i say yes. maybe this new finding isn't valid, maybe it is, i don't know. we'll have to wait for Turkey to announce this is an archeological site to find out more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I did not say they were true.<br>
I said they were not fiction.<br>
<br>
The difference is, these universal symbols and icons and myths have SOME basis in fact.<br>
I said they cannot be taken literally.<br>
<br>
A Great flood almost certainly happened.<br>
Premonition to build an ark to survive a huge flood is not impossible to imagine.<br>
Cities like Sodom most definitely existed, as did the bacchanalia of Pagan Rome.<br>
The parables of the Bible, Cain and Abel, Job...are based in human experince and fact.<br>
<br>
Notice i said BASED.<br>
Pervasive universal symbolism across cultures assuredly is based in fact.<br>

	<div class="content">It amazes me that there are folks that think religion has been a blight on mankind, as if cultural and social evolution is the pride of NON-BELIEF.<br>
<br>
And a Mental Illness at that.<br>
Folks say that no belief, no purpose, no creator, meaning is somehow a VALUE, that having nothing to offer or no belief system is somehow superior.<br>
And what have they contributed in the wake of man's march out of barbarism? Hardly anything at all.<br>
Ko is such a person. He has decidedly bleak and negative view of mankind in general, and nothing to offer.<br>
There are no Christian missionaries around the world caring for the poor and feeding the hungry, as the Bible commands.<br>
Religious charity and social brotherhood doesn't exist in religion. Religion is never a calming affirmative value whatsoever.<br>
Jesus is a disease instead of one of the world's greatest moral philosophers. He probably never existed at all.<br>
<br>
Having no belief is not good enough for these folks. They have all the answers, a handful of nothing.<br>
It's not good for them, that their lives have no meaning whatsoever, just happenstance and nothing. They have to insult people, as if that is some kind of argument.<br>
It's prideful and arrogant bullshit in my book.<br>

Maybe they will see the value someday, though i don't really care.<br>

Gawd, u remember nothing do u, we had this argument, its pretty fucking obvious that societies and language come BEFORE religion. And have other reasons to progress besides religion.

I guess science came from the idea of asking and answering questions, which is wat athiesm pretty much is, u could say in part that athiesm evolved out of religion.... Though who gives a fuck but yea ok. Athiesm is the inventor of nothing, thats a generalised statement about a complicated circumstance, and as such makes no sense wat so ever.<br>

Athiesm/science provides alot of answers, just doesnt pretend to have ALL the answers. As for comfort, believing in something for that reason is just plain irresponsible.<br>

you don't have to be religious to be be spiritual or have a deeper look into things to learn from them. or even believe in higher powers like god, angels and so on. religion is, to me, more of a sect than a spiritual path. the main religions do not teach you it's all in you. they don't tell you you don't NEED anyone to show you the road and that all you will ever need is inside. they do quite the opposite - they teach you you're bad from birth and that if you don't do this or that you'll go to hell. they present god as the human character ever. as if a supreme being who basically created the entire universe can get angry, feel jealousy, vindication or remorse, order the death of others and act quite insecure in regards to the existence of other spiritual teachings other than his. ho hum...sounds more like a fucking politician more than anything remotely related to spirit or quest. sounds like governing and controlling more than guiding and loving. religion will be a positive thing in my view the day they STOP asking people for money, tell them they're sinners and kill in the name of Allah, Jehova or Jesus.<br>
religion could not exist were it not for man's dullness and the fact our society is not based on education but on achievements. <br>
<br>
when my kid comes home from the kindergarten crying cus another kid hit her i'd hold her and let her feel good about how she feels and then talk about what happened and why she thinks the other kid hit her. other parents may tell their kid they should be strong, not cry and not ever let nobody hit them and that they should hit back. <br>
<br>
my kid will grow up and not fall into addictions (drugs, food, sex) when she faces failure, loneliness or fear - she will face her fears and move on while the other kid will probably attack and then meet the consequences: if they fail a test at school they'll most probably attack the teacher, a fellow student or give up on education altogether. when their heart gets broken for the first time they'll most probably resign from love and the opposite sex, deeming them inferior (feminism, chauvinism), have bad relationships and generally not look after themselves.<br>
guess which one of the two is the easier to ensnare in religion or cults.<br>
guess who has the stronger backbone.<br>
<br>
our society thrives on our fears. True spirituality empowers and nurtures you. this begets True Communities as which the main religions fear.<br>

I dont know dude. I think organized religion has been more destructive then anything in our existence. If people wanna believe in some magical man then so be it, it's there choice to do so. I personally dont buy into any of that stuff. I just live my life to it's fullest with enough self esteem to not worry about such things. It's quite possible that we didnt originate from this planet to begin with. I think that there are to many people in this world that really need to realize just how big the universe is and that our existence on this Earth has not been long enough to amount to dick. Science is always advancing and as science advances, religion falls. For example, go back just a few hundred years ago and there were people that thought the Earth was the center of the universe. I really hope Im around when we discover intelligent life on another planet so I can witness the outcome of such a discovery and the effect it will have on organized religion. Should make for an interesting time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The fact that u think ur making a point still is obsurd though, u dont make points, because u dont make an argument.<br>
Stating the same things over and over again doesnt make them true.<br>
<br>
Religion wasnt behind the truly horrendous losses? Really? Even after the argument we had in that other thread i remember, u still think that hitler and the ppl under his rule were athiest?<br>
Sorry but that was, once again, a religious deal. Religion was used to persecute another sect of religious ppl.<br>
<br>
As for charity exisiting, err?<br>
Sure, it would exist without religion, because ppl do have motives and morals outside of religion, fur fuck sake.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You short change the value a belief system represents. Even worse, you present a bogus Religion OR Science argument which is nonsense. Even the notion that religion has been at the root of the worse slaughters in human history is false. Patently false.<br>
<br>
Extreme atheism, replacing religious belief with science, banning religion, or the restriction of religious belief is far more destructive. The Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, North Korea, North Vietnam are examples of replacing religion with the state and have FAILED utterly to lead to successful civil societies.<br>
6 million Jews perished in pursuit of Nazism, a state religion substitute. Evidently you and others believe Hitler was a Christian or something.<br>
Pern hasn't told us what religion Hitler was following that allowed him to murder millions. Why? Because he CANNOT!<br>
<br>
As far as Science is concerned, there is no either/or argument. This argument is shallow, ignorant, and false. Great scientific leaps have happened simultaneously with religion. Only in a few minor exceptions does one find science eschewed in the name of religion.<br>
The Catholic Church, Judaism, even Islam has been instrumental in discoveries and the preservation of science.<br>
<br>
I folks want to say others have a mental disease, they should be ready for a withering counter-argument.<br>
If you claim that there is no place for religion, religion is harmful, or religion precludes science, then YOU HAVE an argument to present. I don't see one.<br>

Isn't that story really only for someone who totally believes in God and Christianity?  Like I said "I don't go around believing all that shit in it exists."  My point is that there are lots of stories in the Bible that one can learn a lot from without believing in it.  Look at Jesus' teachings of nonviolence, for instance; I'm pretty sure a certain black pastor used those in the 1960s to unite and forward the civil rights movement.

Err, man, ur so bad. Maybe u should go back through that other thread. Firstly i told u he was brought up in a roman catholic family, secondly there are quotes of hitler i used to get my point across, and thirdly i did mention that Hitlers beliefs shifted throughout his life, wether or not he actually beleived in his religion of choice or used it doesnt matter.

Even the deaths occurring in clashes between Jews and Muslims is relatively small compared to the massacres elsewhere. <br>

	<div class="content">Religion plays a role more often then u think there.<br>
<br>
I'll use vietnam as an example.<br>
<br>
"In the 17th Century, French missionaries arrived in Vietnam. The Catholic priests received a friendly welcome from the Vietnamese people and they were allowed to live and work in the country. However, the Vietnamese authorities became concerned when the missionaries began to recruit the local people to Roman Catholicism. The converted Catholics were told to abandon their religious customs including that of taking several wives. The missionaries also instructed their followers to give their loyalty to God rather than to their Emperor. Hostility towards the Christian missionaries grew and over the years there were several cases of priests being murdered."<br>
<br>
"President Diem, an elite Vietnamese Catholic, was a widely unpopular ruler, despised for his ruthless policies and his religious bigotry. In a country dominated by small farmers, peasants, and Buddhists (roughly 85% of the population), Diem unapologetically favored the Catholic minority and the landlord class.71 He granted public services, land grants, and tax exemptions to these groups, and freed all Catholics from corvée work—unpaid, state-enforced labor. His government forbade non-Catholics from carrying weapons; officers in Diem's Army of the Republic of Vietnam were pressured to convert to Catholicism lest they lose their ranking or be denied firearms. And in villages throughout the countryside, the military forcefully—and often violently—converted non-Catholic civilians.<br>
<br>
But Vietnamese citizens could do little to challenge his regime. The South Vietnamese government—a political system supported and in many ways created by the United States—was democratic in name, but not in practice. With each year, Diem stiffened punishment for dissent, and imposed bans on all forms of expression perceived as subversive, rebellious, or incendiary, including the display of any flag other than the national flag of South Vietnam."<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>THE MEDICAL VIEW ON A.A.<br>
<br>
Since Dr. Silkworth’s first endorsement of Alcoholics Anonymous, medical societies and physicians throughout the world have set their approval upon us. Following are excerpts from the comments of doctors present at the annual meeting* of the Medical Society of the State of New York where a paper on A.A. was read:<br>
<br>
Dr. Foster Kennedy, neurologist: “This organization of Alcoholics Anonymous calls on two of the greatest reservoirs of power known to man, religion and that instinct for association with one’s fellows . . . the ‘herd instinct.’ I think our profession must take appreciative cognizance of this great therapeutic weapon. If we do not do so, we shall stand convicted of emotional sterility and of having lost the faith that moves mountains, without which medicine can do little.”<br>
<br>
Dr. G. Kirby Collier, psychiatrist: “I have felt that A.A. is a group unto themselves and their best results can be had under their own guidance, as a result of their philosophy. Any therapeutic or philosophic procedure which can prove a recovery rate of 50% to 60% must merit our consideration.”<br>
<br>
Dr. Harry M. Tiebout, psychiatrist: “As a psychiatrist, I have thought a great deal about the relationship of my specialty to A.A. and I have come to the conclusion that our particular function can very often lie in preparing the way for the patient to accept any sort of treatment or outside help. I now conceive the psychiatrist’s job to be the task of breaking down the patient’s inner resistance so that which is inside him will flower, as under the activity of the A.A. program.”<br>
<br>
Dr. W. W. Bauer, broadcasting under the auspices of The American Medical Association in 1946, over the NBC network, said, in part: “Alcoholics Anonymous are no crusaders; not a temperance society. They know that they must never drink. They help others with similar problems . . . In this atmosphere the alcoholic often overcomes his excessive concentration upon himself. Learning to depend upon a higher power and absorb himself in his work with other alcoholics, he remains sober day by day. The days add up into weeks, the weeks into months and years.”<br>
<br>
Dr. John F. Stouffer, Chief Psychiatrist, Philadelphia General Hospital, citing his experience with A.A., said: “The alcoholics we get here at Philadelphia General are mostly those who cannot afford private treatment, and A.A. is by far the greatest thing we have been able to offer them. Even among those who occasionally land back in here again, we observe a profound change in personality. You would hardly recognize them.”<br>
<br>
The American Psychiatric Association requested, in 1949, that a paper be prepared by one of the older members of Alcoholics Anonymous to be read at the Association’s annual meeting of that year. This was done, and the paper was printed in the American Journal of Psychiatry for November 1949.<br>
<br>
(This address is now available in pamphlet form at nominal cost through most A.A. groups or from Box 459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163, under the title “Three Talks to Medical Societies by Bill W.”—formerly called “Bill on Alcoholism” and earlier “Alcoholism the Illness.”)<br>

It is not true that there is a strong either/or Science vs Religion argument.<br>

I am not trying to preach, only to argue that a lot of what Atheists think is nonsense, even if they have some valid points to make. I don't care if one believes or not, only that they are challenged by a strong realistic argument.<br>

I have not seen any good argument that religion is a mental disease.<br>
I don't see a winning case that religion causes massive slaughter or has no or little value.<br>

Yeah there are plenty of Muslims that are like a lot of Christians that pick and choose what to follow when it comes to their good book (the Qur'an in this case) and are not extremists and just wanna live their lives. Those that follow its teachings to the letter are the ones that are the issue. The book is not peaceful in nature. For example:<br>
<br>
Mohamed must have been high the day he wrote this : <br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Prophet! Make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal sternly with them. Hell shall be their home, evil their fate.<br>
<br>
On unbelievers is the curse of Allah.<br>
<br>
Slay them wherever ye find them and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter.<br>
<br>
Fight against them until idolatry is no more and Allah's religion reigns supreme. Fight them until there is no persecution and the religion is God's entirely<br>
<br>
Fighting is obligatory for you, much as you dislike it.<br>
<br>
But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever you find them.<br>
<br>
O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends; they are friends of each other. Those of you who make them his friends is one of them. God does not guide an unjust people.<br>
<br>
Make war on them until idolatry is no more and Allah's religion reigns supreme<br>
<br>
O Prophet! Exhort the believers to fight. If there are 20 steadfast men among you, they shall vanquish 200; and if there are a hundred, they shall rout a thousand unbelievers, for they are devoid of understanding.</em><br>

There u go again, at the hands of atheism. ........????<br>
Wen a group atheists is responsible for something like war/torture u cant actually generalise and say that atheism on the whole was responsible for it, for the simple reason that atheism has no set of guidelines or rules that lead ppl to do any particular thing. Theres no atheist bible or anything, every individual has there own motives and reasoning.<br>
So how are there 10's of millions of ppl dead at the hands of atheism. <br>
Secondly, all religions have caused/been responsible/a part of war/violence/etc Even budhism. But there are so many more reasons to hate religion.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>The Argumentalizer wrote:</cite>Or claiming belief in a creator is a mental illness.</div></blockquote>

Beleiving whole heartedly in something and disregarding all other possibilities because it provides comfort generally requires some fault in ones personality.<br>
And to be perfectly honest strongly suggests weakness.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>The Argumentalizer wrote:</cite>Or the thought that Atheism has anything positive to offer.</div></blockquote>

I dont get that statement or why u keep saying it. U will beleive in something because it has something to offer u, even if theres a good chance, thats its pure bullshit?<br>
Also, i dont care for labels, i dont beleive in religion, i dont beleive it is a good thing, i beleive that the universe/multiverse(who knows).. is extremly complex, anything or anyone who claims to have all the answers is fucked as far as im concerned.

I am talking about religion in general. Only reason Im bringing up Islam is because of the current events in the world. If we were having this discussion during the time of the Crusades, I'd be using it as an example. The belief people have in a higher being is their own business as far as Im concerned, it's the organized religion that bothers me as I've stated in previous posts. As for the rest of your points:<br>
- Pern covered your 10's of millions of dead at the hands of Atheism pretty much. Just because someone like Stalin was Atheist, doesnt mean he slaughtered in the name of it. Many wars have been based strictly off religion. You wont find many wars caused solely because of Atheism.<br>
- You are right, religion has played a very big role in History. I simply believe that it's role has been more negative then positive.<br>
- Belief in a creator isnt a mental illness. Belief in some guy watching over our every move or belief that if we do something very bad we go to hell is a mental illness though. <br>
- Being an Atheist has nothing to do with if someone is going to lead a negative or positive life. How can it? An Atheist doesnt have to worry about some all mighty being striking them down in his name if they dont do what they are preached to do.<br>
- I think it is<br>
- Science and Religion can coexist, they are coexisting right now. I just feel that as science advances, religion falls back. There is plenty of historical evidence of this just within the past 100 years.<br>
- I think you bring up a good argument, but you arent making very good points to support it lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

utter bullshit and i cant believe you're ignorant enough to believe, let alone perpetuate such fallacies.<br>
<br>
bush went to church, a christian voted for him, he became president, then started a war... hence its a religious war?<br>
<br>
an atheist soldier in a moment of self doubt prays, if you exist God let me live through this... hence its a religious war?<br>
<br>
any volunteer military force anywhere in the world has a handful of rabbi's, priest, clergy, clerics.... hence its a religious war?<br>
<br>
15 million christians die in soviet prison camps... hence its a "religious" revolution?<br>
<br>
did the bolsheviks choose their victims because they were christians, or dissidents, or middle class, or just in the way?  five times as many teachers and professors, and more than seven times as many physicians, died at the hands of the bolsheviks than did priests.<br>
<br>
gtfo.<br>
<br>
what creates an "us vs them" mentality is ANY method of dehumanizing the enemy.  dehumanization has been directed against perceived racial or ethnic groups, nationalities, religious groups, genders, minorities of various sexual orientations, disabled people as a class, economic and social classes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol if you are gonna use this as excuse to say religion caused every war.  You could also say that science caused the war since people used science to create the tools used in every war.<br>

do you guys honestly think that there would be no or less wars without religion?  Wars are started for resources and power.  Look in the animal kingdom,  plently of social animals go to battle over resources without religion HOW COULD THAT BE GOD DIDN"T TELL DEM ZOMG<br>

Sure Stalin didn't murder in the name of Atheist but he did in the name of keeping and or gaining power.  The same for most mass murders or wars despite the use of relegion as a tool to get it started..<br>

	<div class="content">Here's a plausible death toll for three of the 'possibly' worst tyrants:<br>
<br>
TYRANT DEATHS <br>
Mao 40Million <br>
Hitler 34M <br>
Stalin 20M <br>
<br>
well, that certainly looks like Mao is our man, but wait. Mao's largest crime is the Great Leap Forward, a bungled attempt to restructure the economy of China which created a famine that killed some 30M. If we confine our indictment to deliberate killings, we get this:<br>
<br>
TYRANT KILLINGS <br>
Hitler 34M <br>
Stalin 20M <br>
Mao 10M <br>
<br>
So it's Hitler, right? Except that most of the deaths on his head were caused by the Second World War. Sure, he started it, but our society does not blanketly condemn the starting of wars (after all, we reserve the right to do it ourselves in a just cause), and we certainly don't consider killing armed enemy soldiers in a fair fight to be a crime against humanity. If we therefore confine ourselves to the cold-blooded murder of unarmed non-combatants, our table rearranges itself again:<br>
<br>
TYRANT MURDERS <br>
Stalin 20M <br>
Hitler 15M <br>
Mao 10M <br>
<br>
This brings Stalin floating to the top. So it look like once you reduce their crimes to the unjustifiably lowest common denominator, then Stalin is worst; however, you might want to argue that dead is dead so it really doesn't matter if you give your victims a chance to fight back. Fighting an unjust or reckless war is certainly a crime against humanity, so our numbers should go back to:<br>
<br>
TYRANT KILLINGS <br>
Hitler 34M <br>
Stalin 20M <br>
Mao 10M <br>
<br>
... and these are just the problems we'll encounter if we accept these numbers without debate. If we want to use the estimates of other scholars, we can pin up to 50 million murders on Stalin, enough to push him to the top of the list regardless of definition. Or we can whittle him down to 10 million murders if we use the low end of the margin of error, and scrounge several more tens of millions for Mao, or away from him.<br>
<br>
So, the answer to the question of "Who is roasting on the hottest fires in Hell?" is "Well, that depends..."<br>
<br>

Here are a few of the century's rulers who could easily be indicted for causing hundreds of thousands of unnatural deaths. Although some might be acquitted due to inadequate evidence or mitigating circumstances, it might be a good idea to not build statues to them: <br>
<br>

Ion Antonescu (Romania: 1940-44) <br>
Ataturk (Turkey: 1920-38) <br>

Yakubu Gowon (Nigeria: 1966-76) <br>
Radovan Karadzic (Serbian Bosnia: 1991-96) <br>
Babrac Kemal (Afghanistan: 1979-87) <br>
Le Duan (Vietnam: 1976-86) <br>
Haile Mengistu (Ethiopia: 1974-91) <br>
Benito Mussolini (Italy: 1922-43) <br>
Ante Pavelic (Croatia: 1941-45) <br>
Antonio de Salazar (Portugal: 1932-68) <br>
Hadji Suharto (Indonesia: 1967-97) <br>

So it's Hitler, right? Except that most of the deaths on his head were caused by the Second World War.

If we therefore confine ourselves to the cold-blooded murder of unarmed non-combatants, our table rearranges itself again:<br>

wait WTF??? WW2 was started unprovoked. for no end whatsoever but for the Narcissistic fantasies of Adolf Hitler. Hitler took on the world with the agenda to 1) Occupy Europe and then 2) the entire world! this was known and publicized.<br>
his agenda included REMOVAL of all none-pure blooded Aryans - including Jews, Homosexual and ALL colored races from the face of the earth. this is not just cause in any book or logic.<br>
<br>
honest, all this talk about religion started all the wars on earth is a tree we should climb down off lol, and who is the biggest asshole in the history of man is just derailing the thread. it's nothing to do with Religion per Se.<br>
The "Religion" we're talking about here is the formulated one. the institutionalized one (pun intended).<br>
i'm saying that type of Religion is the biggest negative force not because it kills people but because it deflates the spirit and weakens the mind.<br>
i'm saying those who think they're being empowered by religion are actually being empowered by spirituality and not the religious SYSTEM. Empowerment is Joy. It isn't Evangelic Amok or Black Magic Trance and it sure as hell not Giving your Money to Jesus.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

come on lead, perns got joan of arc in the 100 years war!  <br>
<br>
lets see... she entered the fray around year 78?  lasted maybe 1.5 years before her capture, trial and death?<br>
<br>
that paints the entire war as a religious war by God...er, by Pern!<br>
<br>
u know pern... clothing is in the background of every country and culture.  in fact uniforms and flags and banners are pretty common in warfare.  im pretty sure some gang bangers somewhere in the world have been murdered for wearing the wrong clothing.  that some people somewhere in the world have been murdered by those coveting the brand of clothing someone is wearing or owns.  that somewhere in the world burning a flag is a tool for inspiring hatred.  therefore... i conclude textiles are a root cause of conflict and we should all just run around naked.  this is my solution for world peace.<br>

If u look closer, u will see that from the start my purpose was to troll the argumentaliser.<br>
And once again i was saying that religion is a tool, not that  it "paints the entire war as a religious war by God". But ill just assume ur playing around there considering how many times ive repeated that.<br>
As for a solution to world peice, i would never presume to know or bother trying to figure that out. After all, i dont have a time machine and an army of super intelligent robots.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
My account has been hacked this morning...<br>

<br>
If you were in my steamfriends, you may have been deleted (this idiot deleted lots of my friends..)<br>
<br>
If oyu want me to re-add you when I'll get my account back, leave a message here.<br>
<br>

If you do get VAC banned maybe they'll unban you if they know you've been hacked? I hope so...but I also hope you haven't been banned.<br>
<br>
If I've been deleted, I'd like to be re-added  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
The account doesn't seem to be banned, I played 1 min on a server VAC Protected. <br>
<br>
I hope VAC ban automatically when the player cheats 'cause if it banns the player few days later, I'll have a bad surprise and lots of game to buy again.. :/<br>
<br>
Thanks for you dvices all.<br>

If a hacker takes your account, cheates on a VAC server, and you then get it back and you found it was banned, Valve doesn't unban the account.<br>
Once the account has been banned, it is NEVER  unbanned.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

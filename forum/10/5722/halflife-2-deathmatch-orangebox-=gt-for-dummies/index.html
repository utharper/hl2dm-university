	<div class="content">Chances are, dear reader, that you have been referred to this thread because you were pubbing along in Vavle-broken/nerf'd hl2dm when someone - who likes the REAL game - asked for a scrim in the mod to which you replied "I don't know how."  <br>
We shall now fuck such ignorance in the ass. <br>
Hard. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Step 1.</strong> Download </span><br>
Download this shit right-hurr, right-quick: <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?53x52vm5sa35kga" class="postlink">http://www.mediafire.com/?53x52vm5sa35kga</a> <br>
It is a .rar archive, so you should NOT have any issues extracting it when it is downloaded. <br>
If you do "have issues" go here: <a href="http://www.7zip.org" class="postlink">http://www.7zip.org</a> and that free and no-BS software will help you out. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Step 2.</strong> Extract </span><br>
For 64-bit windows users, extract the recently acquired archive here : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\sourcemods <br>
Or, simply find your steamapps folder and extract to (or create, then extract to) the sourcemods folder within it. <br>
This may be different for Mac users, but if you are dumb enough to play hl2dm on a mac then you are prolly too stupid to read this thread to begin with. <br>
That includes you, Grainy-Poo - ...Yeah ...I said it - What now butt-chin twat-monger? <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Step 3.</strong> Restart </span><br>
If you had steam open upon extraction, you will need to restart it. This is so your Steam can see the mod and place the short-cut within your steam-library of games. <br>
Even if you did not have steam open, I would recommend restarting steam so that you have to re-enter your login information and "re-validate" your steam user ID ticket. <br>
Some first time users have complained about being booted from Mod Servers with the "Invalid Steam User-ID Ticket" error bullshit. <br>
This is because Vavle, a company that was basically founded over a pair of Mods, has some shit in steam to protect against piracy and crap aimed at the modding community. <br>
It may "think" that the mod is some pirated version of a game that uses the source-engine, but I don't know the technical shit; I just know re-entering login info fixes the error. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Step 4.</strong> Grab the Engine</span><br>
After the mod shows up in your library, but Before doing anything else, I recommended you right-click on the mod's short-cut and goto "properties," then click on "set launch options." <br>
Add " -novid " (without the mother-fucking quotes) to the parameter line or "text-field" that appears. This removes the intro video crap that has caused people like blast to have a flickering screen.<br>
The rest of this step will be covered AUTOMATICALLY by the mod when you try to launch it for the first time.<br>
In the Steam-Library, look for the drag down menu that rests on "ALL GAMES" by default, drag it down and goto the "Tools" section, you need the source 2006 and source 2007 SDK base files for the mod to run. <br>
Again, the Mod will start this download automatically, but I list this for redundancy. <br>
How quickly you download the engine files will depend on how "gay" the steam servers are that day. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Step 5.</strong> Port your Shit. </span><br>
If you don't know how to put your config.cfg into an autoexec.cfg, you're prolly dumber than a Mac-using Hl2dm-player. <br>
For your cfg, get your autoexec.cfg from "steamapps/hl2mp/cfg" and place it in your "sourcemods/hl2mpob/cfg" folder. <br>
For your Xhair, get your HALFLIFE2.ttf (and ONLY the HALFLIFE2.ttf) from "steamapps/hl2mp/resource" and place it in your "sourcemods/hl2mpob/resource" folder (overwriting James' stock file). <br>
As for changing the Xhair color and/or giving it an outline, I recommend you use my clientscheme.res that is set to have an outline and cyan color then edit it to how you choose. <br>
You can find that shit <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B3VdirAFg_BVMjBlNTgwOGMtY2RhMC00NGY5LThjYTMtMzA0ZDIxZmU4MWY1&amp;hl=en" class="postlink">HERE</a></span></strong>, and there is a HuD script that gets rid of the gay-ass excessive HuD blood crap which will be stock in next mod release. Take it or leave it. <br>
Look at the Second Post in this Thread to see my example of an autoexec.cfg for the Mod. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">Step 6.</strong> Play the Mod. </span><br>
This engine does not have the raw mouse input crap, so disable mouse acceleration in windows/your mouse's software for the same exact mouse movement across games. <br>
The latest steam-update seems to have resolved the "sound-defamation" issue, so only read the next line if the Mod seems "fucking quiet." <br>
So just in case, goto the communications tab under recording devices within windows and set it to "do nothing" when windows detects that you are transmitting your voice. <br>
This is only relevant with windows 7/Vista users.  <br>
When you hit snd_restart in the Mod, you only need to open the Options Menu to get Voice-Comm back; whereas in nerf'd DM, you have to re-enter the server. <br>
<br>
You may now "glhf" 'till your dick falls off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

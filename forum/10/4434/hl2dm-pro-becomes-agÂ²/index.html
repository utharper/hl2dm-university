And remove one of the only effective weapons you actually have at spawn.    No more being able to grav nade at spawn plus the fact that, except as a finish weapon,  the SMG without SMG nades (have to pick them up) is like a fart in the wind.  This pretty much leaves just your crowbar/stun stick unless there is a prop handy right near spawn.  This to me means that unless they give you something else at spawn to replace the nades, you are going to die a lot at spawn and pretty much have nothing you can do about it.  No thanks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Hand nades are offensive at spawn, and in free for all ie 3+ players, they become ass spam, u spawn, hear ppl fighting nearby and pull out ur nade, shoot it into their ass and it becomes a bit much. And even if its not in the ass, dying from a nade is usually disapointing, and in no other game do u start off with so much power. The player should have to pick them up like all else, there are more kills overall in everygame(ffa) with hand nades then with weapons that are actually suposed to be control weapons like rpg etc.<br>
<br>
Hand nades in spawn inventory for 1 vs 1 is probably fine i dont know or care.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Plus the argument of not having it because hldm didn't is inconclusive since that's an entire different game all together plus it had no grav gun.   <br>

The only thing I fear and I believe many feel the same is getting hit by a grav nad from someone that spawns. You remove that then its going to be easy spawn fest . You are simply dumbing down a game that is fast past by its very nature.<br>

<br>
Dear HL2DM community, I just love the way you complain about the game being broken but then as soon as somebody tries to do anything about it they get about as much support as a wet tissue.<br>
<br>
To all the people whining about nades, rockets etc: <br>
<br>
That is for <span style="text-decoration:line-through">DM Pro</span> AG2 Mode only. <strong class="text-strong">AG2 mode is not HL2DM, it's closer to the original HLDM.</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">If you want HL2DM you play it in HL2DM mode</strong> which aims to be just like regular HL2DM but without the bugs and also benefits from the additional match / gameplay features of AG2. It's all tweakable - if you don't like something just turn it off.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Nutri-Grain wrote:</cite>Also, if all the bugs of hl2dm are actually going to be nonexistant (hitboxes fixed, props being retarted, etc...) everyone should play AGSQURRED, instead of regular hl2dm.  If the bugs/hitreg in this game are fixed, there may be a chance to revive this dying game, and to get back into the league scene.</div></blockquote>

I've been saying this for about 18 months now and always hit the same arguments:<br>
<br>
1) But I have to download a mod.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Valve isnt going to fix this game for us so we have to do it ourselves. If it's not a mod how else are the community supposed to fix it?</em><br>
<br>
2) But HL2DM mode is not exactly like normal HL2DM<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Then bug report the broken stuff until it IS. J@nek and RATICIDE are what's known in layman's terms as "totally awesome dudes" but they're not mind readers. They need YOUR help.</em><br>
<br>
3) Omg more choices. This will split the community.<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">Yes it will. Into those that want a stable game for competitive play and those that couldn't care less. Giving the competitive players a solid platform to play their matches on is a bad thing is it? Good ol HL2DM isn't going anywhere.</em><br>
<br>
4) I don't like the gauss / longjump / walljump / game modes etc. This isn't HL2DM!<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">No, it isn't. Now leave us old HLDMers to enjoy it and go play Regular HL2DM mode <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></em><br>
<br>
I love HL2DM. I love <span style="text-decoration:line-through">DM Pro</span> AG2. I love HLDM/AG. I love having a game that's not broken. This is an opportunity to bring all of that together in one tidy package. Don't blow it.<br>

Hi all,<br>
<br>
First of all, please note that I don't want to maintain any polemic. You have your opinion that I respect and I have no concern about that. It 's your liberty, it 's our liberty, let's preserve it.<br>
<br>
Now I just would like to come back to this post about handgrenade which generates a big amount of posts but on a misunderstanding. I think that this sentence "removing hand grenades before starting a round" is coming from our readme.txt related to version 1.9.3. It has nothing to see with spawning behaviour. In fact, when playing Last Team Standing or Arena game mod, it was reported that when a round was finished, if an alive player was launching a handgrenade to a spawnpoint 2 seconds before starting the next round, you could kill a player which was spawning in this spawnpoint. It was very annoying and the community asked us to prevent it. So I decided to remove all hand grenades in the battlefield (not the one you have when you spawn) before starting a new round. <br>
<br>
Last thing, you must all understand that in our mod, you have 2 standard gameplay : one is the regular hl2dm gameplay (the one you know when playing vanilla, it has exactly the same behaviour, same weapons when spawning, same quantity of ammo...) and the other is called pro and is including different feature (gauss, bunny hopping...). But there is also a built-in "gameplay sdk" if you want to create your own gameplay by choosing weapons you want to allow, weapons you want on spawn, damage per weapon, ammo per weapon, push impact, speed of players, speed of missile, speed of bolt...many many parameters. There can have many gameplay in additional to the 2 basic ones.<br>
<br>
I hope it clarifies. <br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Grav Gun is a one hit kill at spawn IF you have something to throw with it.  SMG at 2-4 sec kill if the person has no suit and most likely has less than 100 HP.   Against weapons such as the shotty which is less than a 1 sec kill SMG is useless.  Body damage is 5, head damage is 15.  Thats 6 headshots against someone with 100 HP that is jumping and running around...good luck doing that in 2-4 sec, while they blast you with a shotty that can do 100+ damage in one shot.   At least with the nade you have a chance at collateral damage and maybe a kill.<br>
<br>
People are trying to "fix" the game but they are also trying to change it to something other than it is (ie removing nades from spawn), therefore it is a different game, perhaps close, but different nonetheless.  How about someone just fix the damn game as it is instead of trying to remove the things they personally hate and make it into whatever it is they personally like and hope that others agree?<br>
<br>
Edit: If what Janek says is in fact true then I agree with Nutri (divide by zero):<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If this mod stays true to the original hl2dm, but erases the bugs, I will strongly encourage all the server owners to switch over to this mod. Without the bugs, this game can shimmy it's way out of the shadows and back into the light of COMPETITION. If that happens, there may be a bright future for HL2DM.<br>

If the weapon happens to be there at the time you spawn.  Most of the time the engine spawns you very near where you die and you dont have time to "jump" 10 feet to pick up a weapon and turn to confront someone right on you as you spawn.  At least a nade gives you half a chance against the guy flying around the corner with a shotty aiming for your spawn.  So its also a defensive weapon because it can be effective.  <br>
<br>
Overwatch...pppfftt....  You can RPG any spawn point from the top of the building.  The weapons are also so sparse that SMG spray is sometimes the only way to get a kill, particularly in FFA.  It however is a bit balanced out by the lack of health and suit options.  The map is shit IMO. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Pernicious wrote:</cite>And i get smg kills all the time in free for all at spawn, smg is very handy indeed. </div></blockquote>

In servers with noobs that dont know any better sure, but try that in a scrim against people that do know better and are toting a shotty with 100  health and 30 suit.  Not very effective then.<br>
<br>
Plain and simple, I will not switch to a mod that handicaps me even further at spawn just so people wont get killed by a nade in an attempt to defend myself against a  one shot kill.<br>
<br>
If they preserve the game as is and fix the known glitches, I'll give it a try, but I reserve the right to be skeptical.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hand nades are offensive at spawn, and in free for all ie 3+ players, they become ass spam, u spawn, hear ppl fighting nearby and pull out ur nade, shoot it into their ass and it becomes a bit much. And even if its not in the ass, dying from a nade is usually disapointing, and in no other game do u start off with so much power. The player should have to pick them up like all else, there are more kills overall in everygame(ffa) with hand nades then with weapons that are actually suposed to be control weapons like rpg etc.<br>

Comparing AG2 mode to HL2DM = comparing apples to oranges. AG2 mode is not for everybody, some like it some don't and thats fair enough.<br>
<br>
We should focus on Regular HL2DM mode and report any bugs we find. We have the chance here to work with talented developers who are able to do for us what Valve won't. <br>
<br>
Not forgetting that some fixes will also apply to both modes so thats a win/win.<br>
<br>
Also, don't forget the next version that's just around the corner is on the Orange Box engine. This will likely fix some existing bugs and introduce a a few more. I'm eager to try it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

Agreed, but it also applies to Reg mode too which is probably a bad thing :S Would like to see it voteable ideally. <br>

Its a nice change from the slower-paced HL2DM, but I can definitely enjoy both games equally. Having them both in the same package is nice <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It is like not all of you understand that there is different gameplay in promod. By default I set it to my preferred gameplay but it can be changed bya vote, by server admin in server.cfg, it can even be locked by server admin to prevent any vote to turn to an ohter gameplay. All these things also apply to any gamemods (you can specify which gamemods to allow : tdm/ffa only for example or more). There are plenty of options.<br>
<br>
According to Vanilla, if you want to know which are the settings which are applying to hit, hit F11 (admin panek), then click on "Gameplay SDK" button, ensure that "Original hl2mp" is selected in top list box and look at settings in "general panel" and "weapons panels". Here is an example for "general panel" <img src="http://www.adrenalinegamer2.com/temp/vanilla_gameplay.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
As you can see, combine ball killing launcher is not set in vanilla.<br>
<br>
NB: I can see many comments realted to feeling and specific area were there is absolutely no change between code of hl2dm and mine. Don't forget that I started coding on the code used by reg hl2dm. You're speaking of feeling of things which have the original code and say it is different.<br>

So, if I understand correctly when you choose 'xxx' gameplay it's voted for on the server.  or is it just for you?<br>
<br>
would be neat to mesh different styles of gameplay all at once.<br>
<br>
@paradox please try the game before posting again.  <br>
<br>
@anyone who plays .....  hit me up for games please.<br>
<br>
ftw - i've been spamming this game/site at all forums I frequent.  I am throughly impressed by your commitment and willingness to please everyone.  Hopefully when I become a more solid coder I could help out as well.  After awhile it 'gets' to a guy having people do all that work and you just play it and critize (sp) and demand more...  or have never even tried it and you try to sway peoples minds with 'hear say' that u can't even vouch for.

	<div class="content">for the record, my post was on the private synergy forums in an ongoing thread titled "another game".  that thread represents synergy's informal search for potential other games that the clan may branch into playing.  many other games are mentioned in that thread.  just wanted to provide some context.<br>
<br>
i was aware that ag2 is NOT hl2dm.  i had a basic understanding of the various modes of play and sampled them.  what i experienced was frustrating gameplay, for me.  im sure that was mostly due to my skill level and technical difficulties.  for example, my very slow dsl speed has always been a problem when switching weaps in a heated battle (lag).  clearly some ag2 modes are geared towards weapon combo's rather than one shot kills.  thats fine for some people.  but i found it really frustrating to go from rpg to shotty to AR to shotty and wind up dead.  i understand i can vote, so can others on the server.  with the endless possibilities of mode choices, it seems unlikely im going to find a group of people that prefer the same modes that i do.  but hey, i'll wait for the next version to come out and give that a try too.  for now, its not for me.  that in no way minimizes the huge committment the developers have put in creating this mod.  im sure its been a major pita for them.  and even if its not to my liking atm, i can certainly appreciate their efforts on behalf of the gaming community.  thanks!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">1) im not sure where u r going with the "gameplay" thing janek.  but your links say:<br>
<br>
"What is a Gameplay ?<br>
A Gameplay is a set of parameters which does influence the game in terms of :<br>
- weapons : damage, missile/bolt speed, clip size, allowed weapons, ...<br>
- movement : speed, bunny hop or not, wall jump or not, ...<br>
- specific features : hitsound, bright/regular models, longjump module, ..."<br>
<br>
my frustration was with weapons damage and missile/bolt speed (requiring more weapon combos' vs one shot kills)... so am i somehow misusing "gameplay"?<br>
<br>
your links also state:<br>
<br>
"You must be an administrator to be able to create a new gameplay."  im not an adminsitrator.<br>

	<div class="content">Here is my terminology:<br>
- gameplay : set of rules dealing speed, damage bla bla bla<br>
- game mod : ffa, tdm, arena using features of the gameplay <br>
<br>
In pro gameplay, damage are different than in vanilla gameplay but not that much. It is really significative for .357 which is lower and xbow which is higher. For the bolt speed in "vanilla" gameplay it is the same as the one you know, in "pro" gameplay it is faster. There are differences of course.<br>
There is a gamemod called "instantgib" which is killing you with one bullet but your set of weapons are restricted to few aim weapons. Here is the list of gamemods available in AG2 : <a href="http://adrenalinegamer2.com/index.php?site=articles&amp;action=show&amp;articlesID=10" class="postlink">http://adrenalinegamer2.com/index.php?s ... iclesID=10</a> &lt;--- look at section called "Mode: Gameplay Mode Options" (I just discovered there is missing Last Man Standing game mod in this description).<br>
<br>
And yes, in "pro" gameplay we usually switch to few weapons in a row, doing a gauss jump, firing a bolt during the first part of the jump, switching to shotgun, launching a smg1 nade... in the same jump. It is true, but it is going really very very fast. It is really based on masterizing movements tricks. I'm trying to find a movie showing that.<br>
<br>
To come back to the fact you're not admin and can't create your gameplay. You can at least create it on your listen server and test it. If yo have a friend hosting a server you can upload your gameplay in his server so that everybody can test it (gameplay settings are sent to all clients who's connecting to the server).<br>
<br>
EDIT: very old movie of movement tricks by Jatman. There had chanes from this movie but it shows most of the spirit. Unfortunately, bad quality movie ;-(. I don't succeed to find those from s0cke and d0nut. I should contact them : <a href="http://adrenalinegamer2.com/index.php?site=files&amp;file=36" class="postlink">http://adrenalinegamer2.com/index.php?s ... es&amp;file=36</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

AG2 is hl2dm and it's not, different modes.   It adds a bunch of non game changing features to vanilla.  And the Pro version has about 1000 options.  You can as a server owner customize each style of gameplay to your liking.  So each server is gonna be different.  You can go and change the weapon damages pretty much everything.<br>
<br>
It is defiantly worth trying.  Even if you just go and play regular hl2dm on it.  But like I said go and do it with some friends alone first.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not gona change my mind and make me install what has been admitted to as a beta.<br>

Its not bad vibes.  I am glad to see someone doing something, however it would be nice to see something to replace DM thats not a glitchy product, buggier than the original and is somewhat close to the original, not some other game in disguise.   Also if it makes an already hard game that much harder, its not going to attract new blood which we desperately need.<br>
<br>
One concern, I have to say is that the sheer variety of choice, while nice and shows forethought on the part of the developer, may end up causing the same situation we have now: not enough people for any one set of parameters to make any one of them viable.<br>

@para you really need to give this mod a chance and experiment with it a bit on your own, don't always believe everything someone else has to say. You know Ive been playing hl2dm 4-5 years and I have always liked this mod, and can APPRECIATE the work the Janek and Ratcide + the pro community have put into developing this constant work in progress (which I dont think I need to say is way more than VAlve has ever done for us.) I play both modes and I find them both very well done. Also any map can be used but if your going to play pro mode then your map should be edited for that mode to include certain things not in regular mode.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">As already said, AG2 is based on the source HL2DM code meaning that it is 100% compliant with vanilla map but in fact with many more maps as it is also compliant with maps coming from many other mods like css, hidden... As AG2 is under OB engine, it is also able to load maps from TF2 and all OB engine based mods like DODS... <br>
According to editing maps, you must understand that it is not mandatory. There are thousands of dm maps, we can't edit them all. Due to this fact, we develop an algorythm which is dynamically analyzing the map to add specific item in the map when needed. For example, for "pro" gameplay we are adding gauss gun and long jump which are key items in this gameplay (of course, it won't be visible in "vanilla" gameplay). In the same idea, if you want to plat CTF in lockdown or any other maps which does not include any flag zone, it will analyze the map to add these flags in the "best" location for both teams. No need to edit maps.<br>
<br>
We tried to make it as easier as possible to prevent any players from having to use their brain too much on anything else than fragging <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
@Paradox: I can fully understand your point of view and I can also understand you taking of your teammates's opinion. It is quite logical. Anyway, if you want to waste the least amount of time in trying to understand what hl2dmpro/AG2 is, maybe just had a look at this trailer showing main features : <a href="http://www.adrenalinegamer2.com/index.php?site=files&amp;file=58" class="postlink">http://www.adrenalinegamer2.com/index.p ... es&amp;file=58</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">One thing I'd like to point out for mappers is that AG2 has a rather smart entity : <strong class="text-strong">trigger_pushinstant</strong><br>
<br>
It's the same as a trigger_push but without the annoying delay and need to jump to get good height - on top of that it can be tested and tweaked <em class="text-italics">from inside the game</em> until you have it setup exactly how you want it.<br>
<br>
It's nice  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

My guess is that since it was a "feature" in hl2sp, it got ported over with the rest of the code and no one thought to remove it- and this is the case for plenty of crap from sp, much of which doesnt actually work in mp at all, or causes odd bugs instead. Airboats trying to use ammo from hl2sp (and failing), or the sp ents in the lockdown vmf that glitch out the vent plug etc come to mind as similar examples.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
My concern is that if suit damage is changed then people simply wont play it as they "do less damage than normal in this mod". We're a fussy bunch in HL2DM and anything that deviates from the accepted norm causes mass tantrums.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Rocket does 200 on a direct or &lt;64 units hit (not to mention its massive splash radius), hardly not worth getting even with the bug fixed considering how easy it is to aim.<br>
<br>
Also, what is a promod for if not to fix the shortcomings of the original game and make it more skill intensive? Being able to herp~derp with 2x smgnades that miss by 10 feet each and kill someone with 100/100 etc is part of why so many maps are just mindless spamfests, and also why spam is generally overpowered and has to be so limited on each map. Fix the bug and hitscan=explosives for the most part.<br>
<br>
Itd also be nice to see all the dicerolls removed, ie random spin on props, random cone on shotgun, random spreads on every other hitscan except mag, and replaced with some other non-random mitigating factor (damage falloff over distance for hitscan as example) to prevent any of the above listed from becoming op.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You didn't hear this from  me but that is fixed in the latest test patch along with the magnum snap back to origin when playing with high ping and the shotgun pump.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

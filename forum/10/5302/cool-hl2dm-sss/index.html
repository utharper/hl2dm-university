	<div class="content">I'd like to get together a bunch of cool pic's showing off hl2dm.  Maybe even have community contest for ss's?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also I know there is that trailer that carnage made...but it is really more of a quick overview of what hl2dm.  Not a game trailer which just shows some cool in-game stuff or tricks.  I think hl2dm could use a 1-2 minute trailer.  What should it have?   I was thinking just an epic GG battle maybe some clips of ppl jumping the lockdown control gap (not from 1st person)  any other ideas?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">How about xbow bank shots? A lot of people are surprised that the xbow can do that when I explain it to them. Mayybe the difference between the standard moving speed and the speeds achievable by bhopping.<br>
<br>
Also for the epic GG battle it would be an awesome finish to show nade cooking or something along those lines.<br>
<br>
As for the SS, first person or 3rd person?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Xbow bank shots for sure,  those and pinning people to the wall are some of the sickest kills in hl2dm.<br>
<br>
I don't think explaining that bhopping you can move faster is the target audience we are looking for, what fps player doesn't know this?  maybe bf or mw players?  Although i have seen some old cod videos of bhopping.  But same thing as the 'trailer' that we have, you don't explain the game in a trailer you just show it off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 <br>
Which is why my idea was better!<br>
<br>
Epic Gravity Gun fight<br>
<br>
After a bit player A pulls out the AR2 and shoots an orb<br>
<br>
Player B throws a grenade and begins to cook it.<br>
<br>
Before either of them gets a kill a rocket comes out of NOWHERE and kills both of them. <br>
<br>
Orb gets the RPG holder.<br>
<br>
<br>
This feels a lot more epic in my head.. Slo-mo and all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Mike was rushed to the ER last, he had pain in his legs, back, &amp; stomach. His main Aorta of his heart was ripped, he underwent a 10 hour surgery to repair it and is now in stable condition. I am requesting prayers &amp; positive thoughts for him please, there is a chance he may be paralyzed from the waist down. He is only 38 years old. Thank-you!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He's tough and we all expect him to pull through, and I'm sure he'll be back to sniping me with the xbow in no time.<br>

Yes so true. I guess he was fine all day and this just came on at around 6:30 that night. He started getting pains in his legs,then a little later got pains in his stomach and back and started sweating. So he sat on the couch and told his mother he wanted to go to the hospital. When the ambulance got there he couldn't move his legs. Anything can happpen anytime you never know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I did some research on ripped aortas and it looks like it mainly happens due to a spike in blood pressure, usually from weight lifting or intense workout!  This is how John Ritter died.  He was trying to lose weight and was working out like crazy, he started feeling sick then the chest pains came.  Doctors ruled it food poisoning when it turned out to be his aorta.  This is freightening to hear, usually when I have time I will try to lift weights at home and I usually push myself until I almost have to drop them on the floor!!  Was Mike into weight lifting?  It's possible he may have been lifting something heavy at home that could have caused it as well.  Very sad whatever it was. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

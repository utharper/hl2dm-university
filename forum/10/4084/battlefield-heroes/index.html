	<div class="content">Not sure if any of you have chked this game out.  Its in beta stage atm, its free, and the game will be free when fully released, which is soon I hear.  <br>
<br>
Different style of play, reminds me of TF2 with the kid like soundtrack and graphics.  Only like 4 maps atm, fly, tanks, artillery, jeeps, all that shit, 2 teams - Nationals and the Royals.  You can only make 3 or 4 people atm and cannot delete them yet (cuz its beta and they dont want that I guess, so I was told) so choose wisely.  But you can buy wepons and u gain skill points to upgrade your army guy.  Some small RPG elements in it for your character.  Fun game to play occasionally, atm.<br>
<br>
Setup like Quake Live, double login shit and wut not threw web browser.  Here is all the info you need to get your free beta key, and keep the beta key info, cuz that will be your key when the full version is released.  Seems to be rather popular, I heard there were like close to 100,000 beta testers and then another 10,000 of them are in a final beta of the beta or some shit.  Always people playing, smooth servers and a decent hit reg(dont forget to lead a bit as gunner, u are not accurate).<br>

	<div class="content">for what it is worth. I felt the same when I went to the site...should I or shouldn't I click that link...<br>
<br>
But it came from a trusted source, owner of InfamyGaming, so I went ahead, and got a free game.  Your loss, not mine.  I'm sure there are other ways to get free beta keys, this is the one I know.  That is all.  When it first came around it cost like 5 bucks to get a key, but I think they are all free now.  Just gotta find em.<br>

	<div class="content">ive always been a fan of battlefield despite their clunky engine, hopefully this will be more refined.  it's always been pretty fun despite the glitchy bugs though, could defintely see myself spending a few hundred hours playing this!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

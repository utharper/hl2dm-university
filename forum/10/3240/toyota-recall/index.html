No it wasn't a safety issue at all, but if you bought a brand new car and the paint peeled off of the roof and trunk and hood right after the warranty expired, then drive down the street noticing everyone has this problem you would lose a lot of respect for that maker, it's up to them to what choice they make reflecting their image and their choice was simply "we don't give a shit".Toyota would have recalled their vehicles had they experienced this same problem<br>
<br>
As far as the scene here goes that was the tip of the iceberg, Chrysler Chevrolet and Ford all purposefully made shitty cars through that period of time and knew exactly what they were doing, making a cheap thrown together poor excuse of a vehicle (4 different models made from the same parts including body panels) shit drivetrains, shit sensors, shit suspension components and less importantly they were ugly as hell.Poor mixtures of clearcoat sealant being used on the manufacturing line was just a fraction of the neglect and poor design, many motors went from being designed by wise mechanics to being designed by science teams who never used a wrench in their life and that also brought hell to mechanics both professional and at home do it yourselfers.<br>
<br>
When I was around 10 starting to learn about auto repair my father (a Ford man) took me to the cars at his repair garage and showed me the difference in parts between American domestic and Japanese built models, even a kid my age could notice without him there that the brake, steering, ignition,transmission even the fuel delivery system were far superior on the Japanese model, hell he even measured the gaps between the body panels and the Japanese model matched perfect front to back, not the case with the domestic model, and yet the Japanese car was a cheaper Mitsubishi Galant model considered to be an economic family sedan nothing special about it.The domestic model was a Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham (when the Fleetwood was first produced it was considered to be one of the finest auto's ever made and was for many years to come).<br>
<br>
Much of the time upgrading our domestics to performance spec, is spent getting the car to a level of many standard foreign autos costing buckets of cash, and the big three automakers wondered why they needed a bailout they expected people to keep buying these mass produced lemons and it didn't work, I would appreciate their recent effort to make cars with better drivetrains and handling systems and more style but they are grossly overpriced and their reliability is still questionable only time will tell.<br>
<br>
Although there have always been well made, good looking well built American cars, ever since the early to mid 80's they have been put on a pedestal and jacked up in price to the point most of them were at least twice the average Americans yearly income, taking the name Cadillac and nearly ruining it by producing vehicles no where near the Cadillac standard and even taking some general domestic Chevy's slapping a Caddy' emblem on it and adding a leather interior (Cadillac Cimmaron).The "big three" have a lot of work to do to become what they once were but I don't see how they can do it with things like Chrysler buying a $250.000 newspaper ad in the NY Times just to thank us Americans for the bailout they got.<br>
<br>
Back in my dad's time if you couldn't afford a Corvette or Boss Mustang or Charger RT, you had a sea of lower priced models offering similar performance, reliability and still looked pretty bad ass, these days it's not the same with exceptions like the Dodge srt-4 and GM redline line, lot's of European and Japanese models have had these performance and style options the entire time of production and the big three were late.<br>

My 4runner refuses to go down. It's getting on 19 years old ( 1990 ) , how many American models of the same age do you see on the road? A fair sight less than these I'll warrant. There was even a SSC on this truck last year. 19 years later!<br>
<br>
i was having a convo with a workmate last year, he was buying a new f150, his rationale was "cheap parts" and "supporting a job in North America". I countered saying you'll need less parts with a Toy, a look at how fucked the union is ( $75 an hour ?? ), and the fact that a large percentage of the taxes the big 3 actually have to pay after fudging the numbers was destined for the bogus war effort.<br>

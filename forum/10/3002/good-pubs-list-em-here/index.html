	<div class="content">OK so we all know the pub scene in HL2DM is in a pretty sorry state these days, what with puzzle, coop, and superlowgravityonehitsmgkills servers being way too prevalent, and many of the other servers that don't suffer from the preceding maladies running bad maps, being crapped up with unnessecary plugins or just badly configured in general.  however, there ARE still good pubs out there.  <br>
<br>
and this is the thread to list em in.  all of the pubs I'm listing are IMO the best quality this game's pub scene has to offer right now, configured well, running smoothly, running good maps and good settings (if not standard/CAL then something close/passable), etc.  feel free to list any that you like that I left out.<br>
<br>
EE Killboxes and Small Maps<br>
Frank's Hangout<br>
DSR 24/7 HL2DM (has bots but is still good, mostly runs Lockdown)<br>
Khaos' pub<br>
Pomp's Rumpus Room<br>
BOSS server<br>
TSGK servers<br>
That Porn Server<br>
STK's pub<br>
FF Servers<br>
Raymer's Ass Whipping Academy<br>
Radioactive Clan (standard grav server running CAL maps, great server)<br>
TSF #8 The Terror Dome<br>
mkiller's house<br>
Edge's House<br>
Vad's HL2DM Holdouts<br>
Ground Zero (Elite)<br>
DGC Murder Fest<br>
GGG Arnold's Pizza Shop<br>
HCC Stock Grav Advanced<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
EYE servers<br>
BMX Battle Grounds<br>
GOTG servers (Guardian's Lair, and 24/7 Spookface, both also have bots but good maps and good settings)<br>
AOS Welcome To The Cage<br>
$TP$ Guts For Glory (I like the settings on this server even though they're very different, its faster and alot like Pro Mod)<br>
DH Server (has bots and infinite sprint but good other than that)<br>
Brand New For 1979 (LOTS of plugins but good maps and gravity)<br>
Loki's Slaugterhouse is good except for the one-hit xbow kills, not a big fan of that, but a good server other than that<br>
HCC Low Grav Killbox = best lowgrav pub<br>
<br>
will edit if I think of any other good ones.  some of these servers are more active than others.  the ones that aren't as active, well we should remedy that by playing on them cause they're good servers.  all of them are easily findable on the server list, but if people really want IP's that bad I'll try to find em all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote><div><cite>badinfluence wrote:</cite>I find that the good pubs are the ones that good players play on.</div></blockquote>

that goes without saying.  and a good number of them (Radioactive Clan, Porn Server, Ground Zero, Edge's House, mkiller's etc.) have good players playing on them on a regular basis.  I was also judging by which servers were better than the rest in terms of settings, configuration, and maps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Right now, we are running a mix of CAL maps and a few favorite maps in Deathmatch mode with map selection by vote, however, we are thinking about switching it back to Team Deathmatch for certain days to run ctf and older maps we have played over the last four years...<br>
<br>
We have been actively seeking new players as most of our clan has moved on to TF2 as their primary game, so we like having people stop by the server.  BUT, we do not appreciate the constant rudeness of people looking for scrims... if you want to scrim, and we do not want to, please dont be an ass, just play a few minutes and leave ... <br>
<br>
So we welcome all levels of friendly players... personally i dont mind being totally destroyed as long as someone is friendly about it!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

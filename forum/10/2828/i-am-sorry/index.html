Is this what this forum is for?<br>
Isn’t there an unmistakable difference between the harmless ingame ss / youtube / i lol’d threads in the cafeteria and these?<br>
<br>
To board members – in case you’re pondering about the “heavy hand” issue – venting is good. Venting should be kept going in here and that is not and never has been a problem. If someone wishes to vent then WE should trust that person to be mature enough to do only that. Venting is not flaming. Flaming is nothing short of a contagious disease in these forums.<br>
Those who are immature will flamme anything and any topic. So no “heavy hand” is in question as I see it. A “mature hand” is how I’d call it.<br>

If I start tightening up, one section of the community starts crying about egotistical mods deleting everything they post. If I let things go too much, another section starts pming me telling me the site is going downhill.<br>
<br>
My philosophy is this: give everyone a long rope. The undesirable elements typically hang themselves pretty quickly. There will always be people in the community that rub you the wrong way, but it is the stirrers I am looking to get rid of, not the people that contribute 95% of the time, and then mess up the other 5% of the time.<br>

If I thought it was a problem I would have put a stop to it. You seem to think you have done something here?</div></blockquote>

i just think ive shown how people spend more time on posts to bash people than on posts to make the community better. and ive shown how some people have no sense of humor and how others cant detect sarcasm. and i have gotten many luls from all this along with several others.</div></blockquote>

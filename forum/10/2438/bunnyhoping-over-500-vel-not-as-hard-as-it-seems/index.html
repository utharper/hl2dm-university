	<div class="content">So, I was looking at some tutorials for bhoping in CSS, and they gave me some tips on server settings that would help a little. they said that having a tick rate of 100 and setting sv_maxupdaterate 100 would improve your bhop. Now all I did was start a tickrate 100 server and started up a bunnyhoping practice flat map, that's basically a big box I made. ( you can have the map if you want just pm me. ) and I did not bother to change the maxupdaterate.<br>
<br>
I used mousewheelup and down for jump, and mouse5 for crouch ( because my finger got tired of switching from shift to ctrl all the time )<br>
<br>
after almost an hour of bhopen around I got used to the amount of air control needed to gain speed at a high vel. eventually ( after about 30 hops) I was able to pull off around 640 vel with all default settings before I fucked up a jump and came to a stop. ( AND YES ON DEMO! ) and if you don't feel like downloading the demo and map you will see it in my movement vid that's gana show up in the next week or so...<br>
<br>
So if anyone is interested you can pm me, and I will upload the demo + map for ya.<br>
<br>
now before you call H4X! I seriously encourage you to try for yourself. And remember it will take a wile but you will get it. <br>
<br>
remember: SLOW SMOOTH MOUSE MOVEMENTS!<br>
<br>
<br>
and even if you don't make it, this will improve your movement greatly, I can now ( on good days ) bhop at 500 vel on any server without even thinking just because of the mouse movement practiced.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Regular servers: 66<br>
<br>
Dedicated servers: 33<br>
<br>
OBE Dedicated servers: 66<br>
<br>
To set it to 100 you need to set -tickrate 100 and +set fps_max 600</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its true though. Other people and myself have mentioned that. If nothing else, your maps feel smoother, but it has to be the settings or something...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Having updaterate of 100 on a 66tick server should make no difference you still only receive 66 updates per second.  Its probably jsut good maintainance of the server liek regular restarts, cleaning out unwanted files and it not being overloaded.<br>
I find certain maps are "faster" than others meaning its easier to pickup and maintain that speed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

to me:<br>

When someone sees it for the first time, it looks like the ugly unpopular hardcore shooter, gross and morbid, with horrible community swearing in the servers.<br>
when someone sees it for the first time (after playing Half Life 2 story mode); It's the best FPS out there to have fun with the Ggun and joking around, the community is great and people are nice.<br>

who the hell wants to hide on a mountain side surrounded by trees and shrubs you cant see through, waiting 10 minutes for some ass to come by to you can shoot him in the head and be done with it? oh wait. this is a dm thread. i will save the bashing for the CrysisNeedsMorePlayers.com forum.<br>

What I do hate is trying to help people in this game.  No one seems to have the patience.  Seriously, if you ask me "omg, how do you move so fast" or "omg, how do you switch your guns so fast" and I take the time, my time, to help you, and all you can do is say; ya, ok, um, i gotta go after listening for a few minutes, dont ask. <br>
oh, and did you know all bunnyhoppers use macros' (spelling) whatever the f that is.  some ding dong on an FF server said that the other day. Not an FF guy mind you, and he wouldnt explain what is was when I asked also, just kept saying "You Know"<br>

I get called a cheater many many many times when I get to servers where not even reasonably good players ever go, like he one with the map Junkcity. Then when I tell them I don't cheat they just repeat it "cheater". Just cuz I bhop fast (and I escape their rpgs) and have a tremendous aim with x-bow (or, most likely, cuz they are sitting ducks) I get that a lot.<br>
<br>
But that's what I loooove about this game, movement techniques. <br>
<br>
But also, you don't need to be fast like hell to be a good player, and that is the killer part. I've seen some tremendously consistent players that don't speedskate. You can have your own style of gameplay. Most games give you that freedom aswell, but I think there's more in this game.<br>
<br>
And many many other things. Oh Valve... Half Life 2 Deathmatch still lives.......</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have thought alot about this thread lately.  I have to say that in many ways my view of this game has changed since I began to play it, but also many of my views have stayed the same.  <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">The things about this game that make me love it are:</span><br>
It is challenging, and it never gets boring.<br>
There is always something new to learn or someone to continue to challenge me.<br>
Every new map is a new world to explore and learn<br>
I am proud when I finally learn and prefect advanced techniques to the point where I can get them to work under pressure in game.<br>
My clan <br>
The friends I have made and the fun we have had<br>
The good people in this community that feel the same way I do and work to help each other and keep this damn game alive despite the things working against it.<br>
The people that have taken the time and interest to help me with various things, including getting better at this game.<br>
The people that play together (whether it be in pubs or in scrims) for the fun of the game  without caring about the outcome.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">The things about this game that make me sad, angry and frustrated:</span><br>
DRAMA, DRAMA and MOAR DRAMA - Just when I think things have calmed down and I begin to really enjoy DM again, more fucking drama raises its ugly head.<br>
The friends I have lost over this stupid game<br>
Wishing I was better at this game<br>
The people in this community whose only apparent purpose is to ruin it for the rest of us.<br>
The people that put others down because they are not as good as them.<br>
People being brainwashed that strafe jumping, bunny hopping, toggle_zoom and grav gun nading are hax and refusing to believe otherwise<br>
People labeling rpg, smg nade, orbs and nades, spawn killing and reverse spawn killing as cheap or dishonorable kills instead of learning to counter them.<br>
The attitude that some people have that pub players are nothing but noobs to be scorned and ridiculed and that you cant have fun unless you are scrimming all the time.<br>
The attitude that CAL/DMU people are nothing but assholes and that you cant have fun playing in leagues.<br>
Times when people simply write off others as jerks without really giving them a chance <br>
(I have had my first impressions proved wrong on many occasions).<br>
The lack of new people in the game to teach and learn<br>
That people seem to be afraid to play each other because they are too worried about the outcome.<br>
Trying my damnedest to get things done so that we can move forward, only to continually hit a brick wall along the way.<br>
The glitches and bugs that never get fixed<br>
The lack of support from Valve for what is probably the best DM game ever invented.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the latter seems to be happening more than the former these days.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If I'm not mistaking that label for something else, it's one of the dumbest rules I've ever ran into.  I was in some server one day and I spawned behind a guy in drift revised, he was on that ledge where the mag spawns, camping there waiting for someone to enter the hall.  I put a nade into the back of his head and was quickly told that was against the rules.  I was like "????".  So he explains that on their server, you can't spawn and just kill someone.  The exact same scenario happened about 5 min later, this time just stood there for a while, wondering exactly what I should do.  I mean, since I can't kill him, I have to just run away, and I'm sure he's just gonna ignore me and let me out, right?  In the end, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to nade him in the head again and was promptly kicked from the server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I run into very few hardcore people that won't call me a hacker or whine and complain that I won't slow down so they can keep up with what I'm doing. I play the game in the most effecient way possible. KILL everyone. I use everything and anything I can get my hands on to do just that and fly around launching sinks and chairs at people...there are no "RULES". Its DEATHMATCH. That's why I love it. <br>

Those are the most annoying to me. But there's one particularity about explosives that annoyes me much. In CTF there's players (many aren't noobs) that seem to NOT fire bullets at all. They just right-click with SMG 3 times, then left-click with RPG 3 more times, then head back to the ammo room to get 6 more explosives, then go back to the begining of the cycle for 30 minutes after 30 minutes, since I first seen them. Ppl call that being a spammer, I agree.<br>
But I believe that it's not their fault. The CTF maps are too unbalanced. You can get any weapon you want when you spawn, if it's not there go to the other ammo room. But when you need a mag and the two existing are already taken you wait for about 15 seconds or more. When you need more nades or RPG ammo, they respawn every 3 or 4 seconds (1/3 the time needed to return to the cycle I told).<br>
<br>
What reeeeeeaaally annoyes me are noobs (or not so noobs) that camp with RPG 24/7.<br>

(...)</div></blockquote>
Those are the most annoying to me. But there's one particularity about explosives that annoyes me much. In CTF there's players (many aren't noobs) that seem to NOT fire bullets at all. They just right-click with SMG 3 times, then left-click with RPG 3 more times, then head back to the ammo room to get 6 more explosives, then go back to the begining of the cycle for 30 minutes after 30 minutes, since I first seen them. Ppl call that being a spammer, I agree.<br>
But I believe that it's not their fault. The CTF maps are too unbalanced. You can get any weapon you want when you spawn, if it's not there go to the other ammo room. But when you need a mag and the two existing are already taken you wait for about 15 seconds or more. When you need more nades or RPG ammo, they respawn every 3 or 4 seconds (1/3 the time needed to return to the cycle I told).<br>
<br>
What reeeeeeaaally annoyes me are noobs (or not so noobs) that camp with RPG 24/7.<br>
Especially in Overwatch.</div></blockquote>

ESPECIALLY in overwatch the RPG can be countered with well placed NADES. I do it all the time. Also I throw objects at the rocket and destroy it before it gets to me...not so easy at close range but I'm getting better at it. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> And of course I spawn kill.

	<div class="content">LOL I grew up on ctf so when I was a nub all I did was nad and shotgun my way across the bridge then bring out the mag and crossbow when im near the ammo room. Then get the flag drop it and get a raditor and kill everyone coming down ramp with each time picking up the flag and bring it further up then drop and doo the whole thing again untill im on top and i can do a quick run (did not know bhop then) into the water under the bridge good times.<br>
<br>
Now i still have fun more so than dm match like I just love fright my tro a whole team to just get in thier base and steal their flag. But now in pubs well as soon as peeps see clan tag they camp in the basement with orb and rpg but that does not stop me  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil">. <br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">so here a quick sum that I like </span><br>
speed of the game <br>
varity of ways to kill you can get creative <br>
my clan m8s (with out them i probley would of quti some time ago)<br>
shear coolness reaction from people new to the game when the see other play in a frag movie<br>
the ceiling for skill in this game i very high<br>
makes other games look slow as hell I laught at css<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">what i don't like</span><br>
attuide of some players one of the main things that puts me off<br>
valve does not care<br>
No updates leaving the game exposed to hacks and expoits<br>
cheap tactics (well i use them as well but no fun when your on the other end)<br>
some peeps don't give a damn about the community and end up driving others away<br>

Yea that map, and all maps in CTF too. They're too unbalanced. It's so easy to have explosives full time. Makes matches so boring. No fights at all, just RPG "sniping" or ragdoll festivals.<br>
It's only good if you spectate from top-down view, that's hilarious.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">but its good for training if you can get thro 10 players that are to the teeth for every weapon in the game and get across that bridge and beat the hell out of them and take there flag means that you more than ready to play in a dm scrim because you will have less heath and you will not allways have a every weapon at your disposal only weapons you have with limited ammo means you will get less of a chance to practice with weapons. <br>
<br>
I remember I used to just use the mag to improve aim but also learn to use one nad with a combination with a other weapon to save ammo and try not to over use the powerfull weapons. CTF only unbalnced if you don't learn to adapt. Been in a few ctf scrims actauly and have come across teams that just camp and whore but really you just need to adapt get some rpgs your self and some orbs and work out away to the base.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">But the problem is not my adptation, which is pretty well going, the problem is exactly that the maps induce explosives over-usage (or abusive usage, mostly (spam)). I get to kill ppl (or die trying) that waste all the nades, rockets and orbs they have, and then they run away because they feel helpless without them.<br>
<br>
It actually makes me sad to see ppl induced to easy kills (allegedly) and/or bad gameplay. Lots of players, especialy noobs (in the true, not offending, meaning of the word) just waste everything away with one person or two, when they could kill and army with it, even though they are slow and don't know what they're doing. They don't need to worry about wasting them, they know they have 3 more of each in just 10 seconds of waiting in the ammo room.<br>
<br>
When I was a complete noob I learned that it didn't compensate to gather for orbs all the time, not only I would loose loads of time going down there and back, but I also would die most of the times before I unleashed the orb(s). But the only thing that made me prioritize bullets as a method of facing enemies was my back experience with other games alike (Quake, Unreal). I knew I should look for the right times to waste such powerfull weapons. Plus, I like to do things the better way and be as good as I can at them. If it wasn't for all that I'd stay just like "everyone" else...<br>

Perhaps I should create a topic on this... (it's offtopic-ing the post a bit)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

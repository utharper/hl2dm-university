	<div class="content">For those wondering who i am, its Ace. Yea...back from the dead riencarnated. Anyways for any of you interested in learning about Linux there are many free operating systems out there just waiting to be played with.  Currently (at least in my opinion ) Ubuntu is the most friendly with linux beginners. In no way am i an advanced linux user, i understand bits of programming and how things work.   There is a program called Ubuntu Software Center that makes it extremely easy to grab apps and other nice things. It also has a program called PlayOnLinux which allows you to run native Microsoft games. However,  Playonlinux and Directx functionality are not there just yet.  I do not recommend using Linux for gaming.    With that being said learning Linux can be FUN, and should not be afraid of experiencing. I do everything on Linux and use Microsoft for my gaming needs.  Not sure how many of you have tried to learn visual basics on Microsft but i quote<br>

 Currently using Ubuntu 10.10 , There are many things you can do with it that makes at least in my opinion more visual stimulating than windows 7. <br>

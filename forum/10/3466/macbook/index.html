	<div class="content">Macs are purely just for show.  The user interface is better, but good luck if you have a hardware failure.  I would expect as the economy gets worse and/or stabilizes over the next year, Apple is going to take a big hit in their computer division.  Companies that might have splurged for one of these puppies in the past will now go with the much cheaper alternative.  There is no advantage over the PC when it comes to the hardware.  Hands down, PCs have Mac's beat.  As far as stability, I don't think you can beat XP in the PC side.<br>
<br>
As for me, I'm leaning more and more towards linux.  I have tried many distros, they even work on old old hardware that I had sitting around the house.  With the memory and the hard drive size, linux runs much faster than the windows ever did on those machines.  It's stable, and all the office/e-mail programs are free and open source.  So not only am i starting to use this software, but I'm starting to get involved in tweaking/writing new parts to the software.  <br>
<br>
In the end, I think Linux will take enough of a share of the market that Apple and Microsoft will have to seriously rethink their business strategies.  I know they have already, as Microsoft is starting to experiment with the open source side of things, and all the foundation for all Mac OS releases these days are Unix based.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, get a good Laptop for less money and a large hard drive.  Get XP downgrade, and then install a Linux distro.  I bet you'll find you use Linux for most of your day to day things.  And you'll have XP for any gaming you might want to do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dont get how they're better if the hardware needed for rendering/fast apps costs 3 times PC's hardware. I wouldn't dare imagine how much i wouldve paid for having my hardware in a mac. Premiere needs shitload of ram, CS4 now uses GPU to accelerate rendering etc... I totally understand that someone can prefer OSX to anything avaiable for PC, but to say its better for design and whatnot is, as far as 2009 goes, not true anymore.<br>

That the thing. All the macs here are not running any CS4. I only use them because I have no option in the lab I take class in. <br>

The only place where it seems that you NEED to use a mac is for visual effects where you use a program called Shake that only runs on mac.<br>

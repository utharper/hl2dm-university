	<div class="content">my only question is, why is this grain's responsiblilty?  deathwish called out billy.....i've never had a problem with billy, we have always got along fine, but grain is like my little brother.  so why does grain have to step in and fight your battles billy?  i love how you come on here and talk shit all the time and call yourself master of the universe but then when somebody wants to play you, you sit back in the shadows and let grain take the heat.  then you come on and say something like......"less talk, more 1v1ing us."  he's given you  more than enough chances to play him, he's only talking still cause you're not playing.  i understand that DW runs his mouth a lot, but so do you.  i honestly could care less who wins this match, but im sick of seeing this all come down on grain cause you're being a little bitch and letting it happen.  put your money where your fucking mouth is and play him already.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">im still waiting on the answer to this issue.  how can you get a nuke at level 7 or 8 when your first killstreak unlock isnt until level 10?  the 3 default killstreaks are uav, care package, and pred. missle(and we cant get a nuke from a care package).  you dont even have the option to unlock the nuke until level 10.   sooooo, basically there is absolutely no way you could have "Almost got my first tactical nuke!"  at the level you are at in the pics you posted, unless you are hacking. my guess is you are hacking and didnt bother to do a little research before posting this. if you arent hacking then this post is a complete oxymoron, and you just made yourself look unintelligent<br>

That res is designed to be run at a completely different refresh rate since its a widescreen resolution. My monitor doesn't even support that resolution thats how shit that resolution is. My monitor does however support 2048x1536, do your lcd monitors support that?<br>

You are freakishly upset about this to the point I have to wonder if you will even play with any legitimacy, who's to say you haven't dropped 50 on a private cheat because you seem to know what's going to go down regardless of the fact that you know none of us, barely played any of us.<br>
<br>
You fit the description of a heated child willing to do whats necessary to win. I don't think you would beat pincus (in a real match fuck your dusty ss's) let alone beat anyone outside of your homeland.<br>

lawl, i has predicted players like vortex were going to cheat, b4 they cheated, and he had a similar attitude to dw, only much worse. I dont think he would cheat, but if he did it would be in some small way that would give him an advantage that couldnt be disputed.<br>
<br>
As for deathwish vs pincus, they are playing 2 different games, deathwish is doing wateva it takes to win, playing it safe, pincus is more of a risk taker who goes for mag headshots most the time. And he plays with an old shitbox, the fat gay.<br>

Nutri and PB has nothing to prove to themselves, while DW seems to have this urge of feeling the power of his hl2dm skill accomplishment and wants confirmation that his dedication , in fact, paid well by beating everyone.

For the record deathwish, I do recall you beating me the last time we played when you asked me for a 1v1 and I said I'd be worthless but I'll play for fun anyway. You tried your utmost hardest to win, then later posted a screen boasting of your win. However, you've never beaten me by heaps outside of that that I can recall. I do recall beating you by heaps on aim arena when I was playing on a regular basis as well as other maps. Specifically when I was in flaS and later in VDuS.<br>

I googled hollywood onion and found an OLD deviant art account under his name and he just hapend to have a picture of HIMSELF on there.  On top of the picture I was able to track down some other forums and gaming profiles that he's used in the last 2 years. I used to be in socal daily until I was banned recently for posting some shit about onion in the forums at socal. I might have mentioned if he could beat me in the game I might spare his life...apparently they don't have a sense of HUMOR. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> He thought he could hide behind his computer forever and talk shit to everyone and try and destroy everyone elses GOOD time in the game for his own personal amusement as WELL as any forum he touches. Anyway...I just plain don't like him. I've got a picture I just need a name... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">it's pretty sad they would ban you and not him, I bet theres many people who dont play on that server because of him.<br>
Maybe he is part of socal in some way admin or otherwise.<br>
I watched him abuse several player on the server one night so I made it a personal point everytime I see him ingame to soley concentrate on killing him, I dont even look at other players. Atleast 5 times I have sent him into a rage and he has quti. Now if he sees me join he usually quits before I have the chance to start raping him and ignoring all his chat spam. Once I told everyone in the server how to disable sprays and chat so they wouldnt be bothered by nonsense, he really liked that one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

SAME here. He would get pissed when his specing didnt work and call me a hacker. *sigh OH WELL. At least if I was banned I got onion in the process.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

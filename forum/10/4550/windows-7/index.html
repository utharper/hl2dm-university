	<div class="content">I have been using Windows 7 64bit RC (the release candidate) for 5-6 months.  I absolutely love it.  It sees all 8 GB of my RAM.<br>
<br>
Games (well at least HL2DM and World of Goo) run smooth with no issues.<br>
<br>
I routinely have Handbrake compressing a movie (x264) while I use a VPC (which is assigned 2GB of memory) for work, watch a movie, and have Lightroom (64 bit) and Photoshop (64 bit) open so I can edit photos all at the same time.  Win7 just chugs along happy to manage it all smoothly.  <br>
<br>
I love the new taskbar (it reminds me of the one in mac osx but better).  The boot from VHD feature absolutely rocks.<br>
<br>
Win7 is, IMO, the best OS Microsoft has ever turned out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Burn the iso to a disk.  They sometimes have the option of ordering a disk to have for backup for about $10-15 more.  I got one of those with Office just in case.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/170342/upgrading_to_windows_7_why_bother.html" class="postlink">http://www.pcworld.com/article/170342/u ... other.html</a><br>
<br>
Let me open up by saying though that if you're using Vista-you poor, poor person-yes, you should migrate to Windows 7. After all, Windows 7 is really just Vista without the warts. Otherwise, no, I don't see any compelling reason to switch.<br>
<br>
I say this as someone who's also been running Windows 7 since the late betas and I'm currently running the RTM (release to manufacturing) version. I like Windows 7, but if you were to ask me what the big feature, the 'wow' that would make you want to go to the trouble of moving to Windows 7, I'd be left without anything to say. Heck, look at Gralla list, number one on the list is the new taskbar. Microsoft wants me to spend big bucks for a new taskbar!?<br>
<br>
OK, on with the list.<br>
<br>
1) Windows 7 still has all the security of a drunken teenager in a sports car. From Windows for Workgroups and NT 3 until today, Windows is a security joke. It used to be that running Windows just put your head into the noose. Now, millions of lazy Windows users are the reason why the Internet is a mess. If you already do all the right things to keep XP running safely, you're not going to get any safer by buying Windows 7.<br>
<br>
2) Windows 7, no matter how you buy it, is expensive. Does your budget have the extra cash to buy a new and improved taskbar!?<br>
<br>
3) Upgrading from XP to Windows 7 will require that you do a clean install. That means everything on your hard disk gets vaporized during the 'upgrade." Vista users have it easier. So long as they're moving from equivalent version to equivalent version or to Windows 7 Ultimate they can update without needing to rebuild their systems.<br>
<br>
There are lots of ways, like Microsoft's own Windows Easy Transfer and I'm sure there will be many more, to migrate your data from your old system to your new one, but all of them take work. If you have a business with dozens to tens-of-thousands of Windows PCs you can count on a honking, huge upgrade bill.<br>
<br>
4) Did you notice what I didn't say above? I didn't mention transferring your old programs and device drivers from XP to Windows 7. For that, Easy Transfer and most of the first generation of migration programs are of no help at all. You'll need to reinstall your old programs and device drivers. Then, you'll need to update all those programs and drivers. Doesn't that sound like fun? Doesn't that sound like hour after hour per PC of migration work?<br>
<br>
5) XP already works. I can tell you chapter and verse on why you'd be better off running desktop Linux or put a Mac on your desk. Most of you though are happy running XP. If that's you, I'll be darned if I can think of a single, significant change that you'll get from running Windows 7 instead of XP.<br>
<br>
6) If you're an XP user you'll need to learn a new user interface. Parri Munsell, Microsoft's Director of Consumer Product Management for Windows, has been fond of saying, "Our goal was to make the UI (user interface) in Windows 7 much easier to navigate." OK, I'd agree. It is a bit better.<br>
<br>
But, I'm someone who switches operating system interfaces as often as most of you go out to get a pizza. I asked some friends who were XP stalwarts what they thought about the interface. They all thought it was pretty, but, they also all found it annoying to work with since they had to re-learn how to do XP basics. Vista users will have it easier, but XP users can expect to have a learning curve with the new UI.<br>
<br>
And, once more, I find myself asking, "Is there anything here that's really a solid improvement on XP?" Or, to get brass tacks, if I'm a CFO or CIO, I want to know what I'm going to get out of re-training people to the new interface and I'm left thinking there's really nothing game-changing about the Windows 7 UI.<br>
<br>
7) Finally, if you have an older PC, forget about it. I know there are people who swear that Windows 7 will run on low-powered PCs. Yeah, right. I've used Windows 7 on netbooks. It wasn't pretty. Windows 7 Starter Edition? Microsoft won't sell it to you.<br>
<br>
Bottom line. If you want something that's really better than XP, and you're willing to go to the trouble and expense of moving from one platform to another, you'll get real improvements like better security and low up-front costs, from a desktop Linux like SLED (SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop) 11 or Ubuntu 9.04. Windows 7 is certainly better than Vista, but XP... not so much.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">my retail copy of win 7 pro arrived on monday. finally finished its install and have most apps reinstalled now. <br>
<br>
im using the 64bit version and upgraded from xp pro 32but and its a lot faster. not had chance to game on it yet but im sure dx 11 will be rather nice once games come out. <br>
<br>
glad i built a new powerhouse pc last month for its impending arrival. <br>
<br>
still seems strange i receive my copy before the official release date. must have been posted early due to royal mail striking in the uk this week. <br>
<br>
i really like win 7, i tried the rc and straight away decided to order one of the pre release specials as im not a student i could not get it uber cheap but it was still a saving of around 140 gbp.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

In what possible way could that be true? how can formatting your HDD and installing win7 on it be better than installing it on an upgraded piece of kit?<br>
<br>
And as DC states a clean install can be a pita, ideally what you want to do is install win7 on a separate/new HDD and use your old HDD as a slave until you've transferred all your porn over on to your new HDD, then format you old HDD and use it as a backup drive or something....... unless you've already backed everything up on an external drive, then a clean install isn't too bad.</div></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/170342/upgrading_to_windows_7_why_bother.html" class="postlink">http://www.pcworld.com/article/170342/u ... other.html</a><br>
<br>
Let me open up by saying though that if you're using Vista-you poor, poor person-yes, you should migrate to Windows 7. After all, Windows 7 is really just Vista without the warts. Otherwise, no, I don't see any compelling reason to switch.<br>
<br>
I say this as someone who's also been running Windows 7 since the late betas and I'm currently running the RTM (release to manufacturing) version. I like Windows 7, but if you were to ask me what the big feature, the 'wow' that would make you want to go to the trouble of moving to Windows 7, I'd be left without anything to say. Heck, look at Gralla list, number one on the list is the new taskbar. Microsoft wants me to spend big bucks for a new taskbar!?<br>
<br>
OK, on with the list.<br>
<br>
1) Windows 7 still has all the security of a drunken teenager in a sports car. From Windows for Workgroups and NT 3 until today, Windows is a security joke. It used to be that running Windows just put your head into the noose. Now, millions of lazy Windows users are the reason why the Internet is a mess. If you already do all the right things to keep XP running safely, you're not going to get any safer by buying Windows 7.<br>
<br>
2) Windows 7, no matter how you buy it, is expensive. Does your budget have the extra cash to buy a new and improved taskbar!?<br>
<br>
3) Upgrading from XP to Windows 7 will require that you do a clean install. That means everything on your hard disk gets vaporized during the 'upgrade." Vista users have it easier. So long as they're moving from equivalent version to equivalent version or to Windows 7 Ultimate they can update without needing to rebuild their systems.<br>
<br>
There are lots of ways, like Microsoft's own Windows Easy Transfer and I'm sure there will be many more, to migrate your data from your old system to your new one, but all of them take work. If you have a business with dozens to tens-of-thousands of Windows PCs you can count on a honking, huge upgrade bill.<br>
<br>
4) Did you notice what I didn't say above? I didn't mention transferring your old programs and device drivers from XP to Windows 7. For that, Easy Transfer and most of the first generation of migration programs are of no help at all. You'll need to reinstall your old programs and device drivers. Then, you'll need to update all those programs and drivers. Doesn't that sound like fun? Doesn't that sound like hour after hour per PC of migration work?<br>
<br>
5) XP already works. I can tell you chapter and verse on why you'd be better off running desktop Linux or put a Mac on your desk. Most of you though are happy running XP. If that's you, I'll be darned if I can think of a single, significant change that you'll get from running Windows 7 instead of XP.<br>
<br>
6) If you're an XP user you'll need to learn a new user interface. Parri Munsell, Microsoft's Director of Consumer Product Management for Windows, has been fond of saying, "Our goal was to make the UI (user interface) in Windows 7 much easier to navigate." OK, I'd agree. It is a bit better.<br>
<br>
But, I'm someone who switches operating system interfaces as often as most of you go out to get a pizza. I asked some friends who were XP stalwarts what they thought about the interface. They all thought it was pretty, but, they also all found it annoying to work with since they had to re-learn how to do XP basics. Vista users will have it easier, but XP users can expect to have a learning curve with the new UI.<br>
<br>
And, once more, I find myself asking, "Is there anything here that's really a solid improvement on XP?" Or, to get brass tacks, if I'm a CFO or CIO, I want to know what I'm going to get out of re-training people to the new interface and I'm left thinking there's really nothing game-changing about the Windows 7 UI.<br>
<br>
7) Finally, if you have an older PC, forget about it. I know there are people who swear that Windows 7 will run on low-powered PCs. Yeah, right. I've used Windows 7 on netbooks. It wasn't pretty. Windows 7 Starter Edition? Microsoft won't sell it to you.<br>
<br>
Bottom line. If you want something that's really better than XP, and you're willing to go to the trouble and expense of moving from one platform to another, you'll get real improvements like better security and low up-front costs, from a desktop Linux like SLED (SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop) 11 or Ubuntu 9.04. Windows 7 is certainly better than Vista, but XP... not so much.</div></blockquote>
mmm.... w7 is certainly faster than vista imho and i used a skinny version of w7 on my lappy and um pretty sure the fixes that microsoft released last week sorted a few issues you have noted.. yeah i love linux too (mandriva) but its not 4 everyone...lastly 1 day it may look like this hopefully <a href="https://vimeo.com/4186558" class="postlink">http://vimeo.com/4186558</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Good discussion here.  My response to several points:<br>
<br>
Clean install is better because you don't get a lot of left over baggage from the previous OS.  You also redo your registry, which no matter how many registry cleaners you use, always eventually gets bogged up with useless shit from uninstalled programs, etc.<br>
<br>
Yes it can be a PITA, but  have installed/reinstalled an OS enough times now that I am pretty much aware of all the little tricks Microshit throws at you during the process.  I've beaten it every time so far so I am not afraid it a little OS and I like the challenge.  I am pretty good at learning new things and I am ok with learning a new OS.<br>
<br>
You can buy an OEM version of Win7 ultimate for $200 instead of $300 for the retail version.  $400 to upgrade 2 computers doesn't seem expensive or unreasonable to me, its just the cost of having an up to date computer.  I am fortunate that I have a well paying, stable job which I realize not everyone is so fortunate to be in that position atm.<br>
<br>
Security may be crap for an Win OS, that's true, but anyone that relies on an OS alone for security is an idiot.  I purchase a very good security program (no its not POS Norton or Mcafee) for my computers and I have never had a problem.  I see it as an inexpensive investment/insuance policy when compared to the cost/investment that the computer itself is.<br>
<br>
Im doing this because I have a Vista laptop and I hate Vista.  I would like both computers to have the same OS just for the sake of simplicity.  My desktop is XP (DX9 technology) and since I do plan on playing DX10 (there are a few current games) and 11 games, I would like to take full advantage of the current technology for the purty graphics.<br>
<br>
I plan on doing the laptop first and there is really nothing on there that needs backing up as its all on my desktop as well.  As for the desktop, I back up my important files regularly anyway, including driver/program downloads to an external drive anyway.  Ill already have many of them on the laptop, which is normally set<br>
up near the desktop.  I can use the laptop to download something if I missed it.  For the desktop, the plan is to install Win7 on a brand new HD because the OS drive I have now is 2 years old and the other drive I have just like it/same age died this summer.  I can even play a game on the LT in between pogram installs on the DT.  Finally, Im going to do the desktop around Christmas when I have a few days off.  Ill just crank up the music and work on the computer, which if you hadn't noticed, I enjoy doing.  My computers are one of my hobbies.  What else would I do anyway?  Watch soap operas?.....ppfftt.....NOT!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, digital river and windows fucked shit up. If you bought 64bit windows, and you have 32bit windows already. It won't unpack the package that you downloaded.

<br>
If you have vista its probably not needed to upgrade, if you have XP you are really riding an old OS you still do not need to upgrade if your computer does everything but many people are reporting Windows 7 is running faster then XP on the same hardware. If you are a computer nut though this OS is good and if you are going to buy it sooner or later then sooner is better to get the most for your money. If you build your own machines like many gamers you upgrade anytime you like. Also there are so many kicking deals for windows 7 now. For me I will be upgrading all my windows XP machines to windows 7 except maybe 1 which has a tv tuner that is about 7 years old which I cannot find new drivers for. I may test the XP VM on it in Windows 7 though. I will do it in a couple weeks when the dust settles and I actually get the item shipped right away. I do have 1 copy preordered though so maybe that will come soon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It would take way to much text and time to explain why win7 is better then xp. Google can surely help you find all the things that win7 does that xp does not. I always liked xp and I would consider Vista better then xp had it not indexed shit for hours on end slowing things to a crawl, but everything is just easier to deal with in win7 when it comes to doing things within the operating system.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Here is the easiest way I can explain it. There are 2 soda cans. 1 is within arms reach (win7's can) and the other is 200 feet away. Both are in the same place but it takes you 200 feet to get the same can in xp. For example, click the start button in win7 and all your programs are right there. Click it in xp and you scroll to the programs button then it opens another window set and then perhaps another. Xp is like that all over the place whereas win7 has a much smarter setup. There are tons of little features as well that just makes life better. Would I pay what Microsoft is charging for Win7? Hell no. But there are tons of ways to get it cheap or for free. And yes, After the first service pack for Vista, it was better then xp imo.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Even for a secretary the faster rig is better why should they sit around waiting for programs to load, after all they will use the computer more then most during a work day. <br>
<br>
As said the start menu in windows vista/7 is worlds faster then XP and it does not require you to configure anything the programs you use most just start showing up in the list. If you cant find something or need it faster just hit the windows key then start typing the name or any part of the name of a program. I no longer go to control panel I just type mouse or programs in the start menu most of the time that is the first item and I hit enter. <br>
<br>
Office 2007 was the same way old people complain new people adapt M$ makes some mistakes but they get more right then they get wrong and they spend tons of money actually measuring how fast people get tasks done this is what separates them from most other companies. This is why when it is important to make people productive as in the work place where it costs money to waste time most computers run M$ products. <br>
<br>
Also one other thing to think about is that the fact that so many people sit around saying you do not need a more powerful computer for X or Y also hurts us more programs would take advantage of automated features and rendering if the majority of computers bought had at least an ATI or nVidia graphics solution instead of intel garbage.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I found that there is one less click and a can is 200 feet away so far.<br>
And that it has a pretty dock/taskbar thingy.<br>
And it looks cool.<br>
And it burns an ISO, which i have apps already that do that.<br>
Also, you can put 25 or 30 apps on the Start Menu. Who the **** even uses all that?!?!<br>
It WOULD be an inductive bias malfunction if i received powerful reasons and then rejected them.<br>

<br>
Windows 7 will also do more than previous operating systems with graphics--and here, DirectX 11 stands out as the most highly anticipated technology. A recent AMD blog describes a "beast called the tessellator...which enables games developers to create smoother, less blocky and more organic looking objects in games." The blog discusses how DirectX has been redesigned "to ensure that it is much more efficient" at using multicore processors, such as the AMD Opteron chip.<br>
<br>
Beyond games, Windows 7 has the potential to turn a graphics processing unit (GPU) from AMD or Nvidia into a general-purpose compute engine, used to accelerate everyday computing tasks like a CPU. Specifically, "the compute shader" can be used to speed up more common computing tasks. The buzz word used to describe this technology is a mouthful: GPGPU or general-purpose graphics processing unit.<br>
<br>
In an April interview, Sumit Gupta, product manager for Nvidia's Tesla products, described GPGPU in some detail. "What that essentially means to consumers is, if your laptop has an Nvidia GPU or ATI GPU, it will run the operating system faster because the operating system will essentially see two processors in the system. For the first time, the operating system is going to see the GPU both as a graphics chip and as a compute engine," he said.<br>
<br>
Ive also heard and read that win7 utilises multi core processors and hyperthreading better etc, and even read certain things on the nvidia website about win7. In any case, its just good, allright.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">None of the OS versions are the same with respect to the way they manage memory. If you were to imagine windows xp as being the baseline windows vista used alot more ram, tons more but it also loaded programs much faster because it was using superfetch to load programs you were predicted to use into memory ahead of time. I think all operating systems do this to some extent it is just vista took it to the next level. Personally I love it what is the point of having ram if you are not going to use it? Alot of stupid people considered this a bad thing they just think an OS which uses lots of ram sucks. Windows 7 still uses superfetch but has altered the way it does it to now use less ram total and M$ believes it is better or more accurate. People are certainly finding with laptops that windows 7 increases battery life. Also because windows 7 alters the way it uses super fetch it tends to boot faster. Like I said no OS utilizes ram the same when you buy the latest OS you are taking advantage of the latest and most intelligent approach to allocating and preloading ram that a particular company has to offer. In an effort to get you to upgrade they will not extend this to older operating systems. <br>
<br>
That is only one example with hundreds of other little things the same is true. The question is not if you will upgrade but rather when and how far behind you want to be when you do it? Alot of people were able to skip vista because of the short time frame between its release and windows 7. Much like many could skip an OS during the 98,me,2000 days but xp was left in the pipe so long almost no one could skip it. The way I see it if you are still on XP you probably cannot wait till windows 8 to upgrade in which case if you build your own computers then you might as well buy windows 7 while it is cheap and get the most useful years out of it. Maybe you could skip from 7 to 9 depending on how tight M$ keeps their release schedule. If you buy prebuilt computers then they will most likely come with an OS in which case you may want to save money and just wait. But for me and other people who value time even a fill 100$ price is worth the time saving the new user interface offers. A few less clicks here and there add up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not magically, it is a matter of structure and architecture.<br>

Is it magically that HL1 Source gives you a lot more fps with modern computers than HL1 GoldSource? <br>

Not magically, it is a matter of structure and architecture.<br>

Is it magically that HL1 Source gives you a lot more fps with modern computers than HL1 GoldSource? <br>

Because what you are saying is such a vague statement and you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Fearsome was talking about how the OS manages memory. That is very true.

You dont seem to get it. Im well aware x64 can handle larger amounts of memory to be used. What you dont seem to get is that x64 on Win7 is no different then x64 on XP with how it works. They both do the same fucking thing. 64 bit refers to the way a computer's PROCESSOR handles information. As I already said, your statement was vague. Fearsome was actually discussing how each Operating System managed memory. Which btw, Win7 manages memory better in 32 bit and 64 bit. Also, why would I buy parts at Newegg?

You are a fucking idiot and you dont know what you are talking about because you also said this "x64 CPU with 4GB of RAM or more". Which doesnt make any sense when Vista and XP x64 do the same damn thing. So your dumb statement about Win7 giving you 40 bonus fps just because you can run 4GB of RAM or more makes me feel you dont know what you are talking about. Run the same hardware on XP x64 and you will get the same fps, more the likely better fps, compared to Win7.

No, why would I do that? I would never go back to XP. I preferred Vista and prefer Win7 over XP. I also dont remember Soiz saying anything about the 40 bonus fps being related to the game being dx10 or dx9 so that really doesnt have anything to do with my argument with him. Im pretty sure that Win7 can run dx9 games just fine though if a comparison was needed <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
This isnt about right or wrong Bad Influence. First off this whole thing started because Pernicious said "Argumentaliser, win7 makes better use of new hardware, that is the only reason u need to use it." and then I replied "I dont even understand what that means. Im not aware of any hardware that win7 can make better use of more then XP or Vista for that matter. Please explain what you mean." Pernicious then replied about DX 10 and 11 and that was pretty much the end of it as I didnt understand what he was actually referring to as his statement was a bit vague. <br>
<br>
Then Soiz piped up and said "x64 CPU with 4GB of RAM or more." My reply was "Um XP and Vista are the same as Win7 in this regard. Try again." because anyone with a brain knows that XP and Vista can take advantage of 4GB of RAM or more as well. Obviously Soiz was unaware of this phenomenon. Then he pipes up with this comment "Yeah right, that's why you get a bonus of 40fps+ when using Vista SP1 x64 or W7 x64 instead of XP." Really?? And that is all because you can use 4GB of RAM or more in x64 Win7??? Sorry. It has to do with a lot more then that since XP can do the same damn thing. Then Soiz had to start being dickish because he felt his e-peen was being trampled on. QQ<br>
<br>
Anyways, here are a couple of posts I grabbed from a quick search relating to Win7 x64 vs XP x64. Not that it really matters since Soiz will say his comments were related to modern hardware. Which ofcourse my whole argument with him in the first place was related to his first 2 stupid comments that say nothing about that...<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I currently dual-boot a quad-core system with both XP Pro x64 &amp; Win7 RC x64. I can not find any difference in performance between the two in the games and applications I use. I think that performance is determined more by the hardware, than either operating system. That said, I found that some of my old favourite 16-bit applications will not install or run (e.g. ActivePorts) on either 64-bit OS.</div></blockquote>

I'm not taking it seriously either. I just felt the need to tell Soiz that his 2 posts relating to x64 were misleading and made him look like he didnt know wtf he was talking about.

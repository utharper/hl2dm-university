	<div class="content">Hey fellas, I don't expect to have a start a fight. Just for curiosity, what do you think about the Malvinas/Falklands conflict? Not 1982, nowadays.<br>
<br>
I personally don't hate the UK citizens. But some assholes do. And some assholes hate all Argentinians for it.<br>
<br>
So, if you do have a stand, which is it? And what are your reasons?<br>
<br>
I never heard the British arguments of why do these islands belong to you, I know that the Kelpers are actually British, but Miami is also poblated with Cubans, Mexicans, etc etc and they belong to the US, not else. And the Argentine Constitution says that inmigrants are welcome to stay in our country as long as they want. So they could live and own lands in the islands without being nationalized. So for now I don't think that's a valid argument. What do you think?<br>
<br>
Please don't fight and start insulting me or my nation.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Uruguay is like one province of Argentina, their military presence is insignificant. I bet the UK is sending warships and submarines because Chavez said that they have our back. And so did the rest of South America. <br>
<br>
Anyway, there's a null chance that we will attack first. Our military missions are pacific only. Haiti, Chile, etc. In 1982 it was a Military Joint (not a democratic government) who decided to invade the Islands because their popularity among The People was falling. And losing the war turned out to be worst that not making one in the first place, lol.<br>

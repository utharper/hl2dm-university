	<div class="content">So here's my problem...i got people messaging and inviting me to this fucking side show event ran by this transvestite we call kigha.  Now any rational and logical human being would see that this is a sham.  He has already shown to be a shady individual.....as seen with the exposing of the lukegt/kigha relationship and other shady dealings.....<br>
<br>
 I see red flags everywhere.  The amount of you guys going bonkers over the possibility of winning 2 grand is beyond me. Does logic not come into play or does the pursuit of monies blind that.<br>

 Don't be a sucker!<br>

One day, she approached the local electrician Dave and accused him of being an alcoholic.<br>

Dave looked at her without saying a word, turned, and left.<br>

One day, he approached the local aristocrat Ace and accused him of being a jerk that lacked the intelligence to ever see the truth of god and politics.<br>
   "Hey you ignorant jerk, you are too young to even begin to understand what i know! jesus loves me and gives me the power to <em class="text-italics">touch</em> little boys hearts" <br>

   Ace took it all in , looked at his bearded picture and wondered why this man would be interested in touching so many...<br>

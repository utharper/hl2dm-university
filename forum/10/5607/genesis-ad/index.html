	<div class="content">you guys should check this game out.  i started playing the "first step" missions just to see what it was like. i believe it just was released from beta a little while ago.  after about 3 or 4 games i was fucking hooked.  its one of those free to play games that you dont have a clue why you're playing it, but you cant stop.  works off a credit system, where you buy weapons for a certain amount of days.   they give you a lot of credits to start with so you can sample most of the weapons.  plus you can buy different suits, back packs, helmets etc.  there are some cool jumping moves, like jumping off walls and dodge jumps.  its not as fast as quake or hl2dm, but its fast enough to keep my attention.  the weapons sound really nice.  the maps are very similar to hl2dm/quake maps and there are a few different modes.  like i said, its free to play, so if you have a chance DL it and try it out.  hit me up if you like it and hopefully we can get a few of us together.  most of the players arent very good, but once and a while you will see somebody with some pretty good skill.<br>

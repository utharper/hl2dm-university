	<div class="content">In game name of course. I'll start since I stole the idea lol. Tell the origin, what it means and all of that good stuff.<br>
<br>
I was actually talking with a friend of mine [GoTg] Blood about getting HL2 and I was trying to think of a name for yahoo messenger and when I would play the game. We went through all these names and I thought hey I wanted Cybercrash (computer geek and what not). Well someone took Cybercrash so I changed it to Cyberclash and Blood said he liked it. Since then I tried to take every game name since. My first steam ID wasn't Cyberclash so I went back to go get it, and IT WAS TAKEN!!  So it went from (STK) Cyberclash to (STK)Cyb3rclash. So my Steam ID is cyb3rclash.<br>
<br>
So I'm not really sure what it means because it's kind of made up? But it's kind of become my online persona.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well my boss at work was telling me about how he liked to play HL1, TFC and CS. I decided to give it a try and because he was mostly playing CS1.6, that was my first real online mp game. <br>
<br>
I joined a server and got slaughtered over and over. I really felt like I had a giant target painted on my chest, like the deer from that Gary Larson cartoon "Bummer of a birthmark HAL". So I changed my name to Walking Target although initially it was something silly like W4lk1ng T4rg3t.  <br>
<br>
It just stuck, even though I got better I never bothered to change it. My spray was the "Bummer of a birthmark" cartoon, which I still use on occasion, except I photoshopped some HL2 weapons into it when I started playing HL2DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My parents decided to give me and my brother royalty names, Charles and Phillip respectively. They were about to name my sister (who is the first born) Elizabeth, but they stuck with something else. Why they gave us royalty names, I do not know.<br>
<br>
[BMC] HeadJob. I used to alias as [HL]Headcrab when this game was rather new. My favorite critters of the Half-Life series were Snarks, but due to their absence in HL2, I named myself after my second favorite Xen alien, the Headcrab. I was killing people left and right, especially with my magnum. One day, I saw a server hosting ctf_2fort. Knowing of 2fort in TFC, I decided to join and show everyone what's up. However, things didn't go as expected. I was getting sniped back and forth on the battlements by two particular players: Sadistical and 56k Holiday (Skippy). This infuriated me, but also put me back in reality; I am not the best player in the game. Deciding to perhaps attempt to join this [BMC] clan, I then regularly played on there server, introducing me a few of HL2DM's counterparts of [once] popular TFC maps such as 2fort, well, avanti, and warpath (no ctf_rock2, push, dustbowl, etc. back then). A player named Durden (who you now may know as Corrosive) saw my skill as I was regularly scoring kills in Avanti with the Magnum and bunny hopping (not many people knew it late 2004-mid 2005, even though the map made players spawn with RPGs. Fortunately, Durden told about me to the rest of the BMC gang, allowing me to have a tryout despite Skippy and Sadistical's doubts about me. I can STILL remember how the tryouts went. We would 1v1 random people in the middle bridge of 2fort, and although we did not openly forbid it, neither of us ever used the SMG nades or other explosives. We stuck to Magnums, seldom Shotgun shots, and a rare XBow. That, or we sniped through the battlements. Having bested one of their best (albeit cocky, since he didn't return to his base to recover ammo or health after killing me) players aka Killer, Sadistical decided to snipe me 1v1. I did fairly well, maybe even beat him, although I do not remember that far. Impressed by my playing, Sadistical officially let me in the Blood Moon Cult. Now, he wasn't too fond of my name either. Headcrab. How silly did that sound? I suggested some Starcraft hero names like Zeratul, Fenix, or Tassadar, but he didn't like them either. Finally, he suggested to me "HeadJob" because it sounded hilarious but also represented my ability to score headshots with the Magnum and my liking for Headcrabs. And so, I reluctantly took the name and gradually grew into it.<br>
<br>
[Cartel] Renegade Police/Smokin' Lamarr: People began to dislike Sadistical being the leader of BMC for different reasons. Some felt he was too young (he was FIFTEEN at the time, wow that was long ago), others didn't like his attitude (Sadistical, I will admit you used to get way too angry at this game long ago  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> ). Whatever the reason, BMC split into two main groups, HAX and Cartel. The rest went off to GU, or a combination. HAX and Cartel at first had a friendly rivalry, hoping to have weekly scrims. However, things went downhill. I don't remember the true reason, but I do know that Cartel lost or tied with HAX in all the CTF maps except for Warpath. I remember it was especially a scrim in Rock2 that made things heat up. Infuriated with their own RPG spamming while we at Cartel tried our best to stick with Magnum and "skill weapons", we eventually succumbed into using RPGs ourselves. Whatever offensive tactics we tried, HAX would squish due to Rock2's defense bias. However, one of their members snuck into our base and capped our key into our gas chambers. After that, it became a turtlefest. Our next map, Warpath, ended up in Durden and Christian trading words. I do remember Durden saying these exact words to him. "Blow me." I laughed a bit, but Sadistical thought Durden was being unusually more hostile than his normally calm self. This started the big rivalry.<br>
<br>
As times pass by (I'm not sure this is in chronological order), Christian recruited a girl named Boardingrl (who was about my age, maybe slightly older, I remember we were about 13 at the time though). She was a rather good sniper, but Sadistical suspected that she was recruited for other reasons. Christian spent an unusual lot of time with her, teaching her every single trick he knew and playing tons of game hours with her. Eventually, Boardingrl was recruited to nearly the same rank as Christian as co-leader. This infuriated Sadistical, who believed that if he didn't deserve leadership, then at least someone else like HeadJob should've gotten it. Sadistical left Cartel and went off to HAX, who forgave him for his acts and let him in. However, the people at Cartel thought he was having a major power loss trip, thus fueling up heat between Cartel and HAX even moreso. This is where things went plain ugly. I will admit that I sometimes left sarcastic remarks and started arguments directed towards Durden and Sadistical in their forums, almost to the point where I got banned. They also mocked me because at one point, I left Cartel and rejoined them. The rest of HAX just brushed me off as "childish" and didn't care too much for me or Cartel. Ever since then, the CTF scrimming scene has went downhill.<br>
<br>
We eventually started to play CTF mod (I believe this was before Sadistical was out of Cartel) and many of our needs were met there. Faster speed, balanced weapons, more advanced movement, cool runes, non-buggy flags, and of course, ctf_canal. What more could we ask for? CTF mod servers also had cool stats and gave daily awards to players for doing things such as getting the most kills in a day with a certain weapon. One such title was "Renegade Police" for achieving the most stunstick kills in a day. I grew rather fond of that name and adopted it later on.<br>
<br>
One fun thing we did was to alias as either [TSS]. [TLS]. and other silly names, then go scrim noob clans and whatnot. I kind a brought this tradition to other clans I have joined, heh. Sorry, I'm guilty of aliasing. Seeing as how I know and have met FOUR people who have my exact first and last name in real life, I have some identity confusion sometimes. Some names I used at this time (and at late-BMC) include: Ms. Nana, Vivid, Vivian, The Human Isotope, Smokin' Lamarr, Hedy Lamarr, etc.<br>
<br>
[GU] Unzerstorbar: I began to dislike the direction Cartel was going towards. We haven't scrimmed in forever. Christian seemed to be biased towards Boardingrl. Bluebird was quitting HL2DM for BF2 and ultimately left Cartel to join GU and start his own BF2 clan. All the other original Cartel members (such as hbrohi) have been going AWOL and whatnot. I regret disappointing Sadistical, Durden, and the rest of HAX, especially since they were the ones who even opened up my mind to the world of HL2DMCTF. I later apologized to them, and to my surprise, they took it. I didn't really want to join HAX (as some of their members have asked and tried to tempt me to do so) due to it having me appear as a disloyal traitor and hypocrite by joining HAX the moment after angering them. Sadistical and Durden told me of another team to scrim CTF with, and that was GU. So I went to join GU and became one of their unofficial HL2DM scrim leaders. All while Christian was prompting me to join Cartel again after I went AFK for a while and some HAX members asking me to join them. I wanted to stay neutral. That's a characteristic of me.<br>
<br>
To my dismay, we at the GU CTF team were rather badly coordinated, and some of the members were really disruptive in teamwork or hopeless in individual skill. I believe we played one ILDM match after "beating" VDuS in a pre-season or practice match (they let us cap once to boost our self esteem) and promptly quti after losing to [GGG] by a landslide, who we have dominated in CTF before the actual season started. With GU not being a clan and rather a "community", I lost hope for a while in being able to participate in HL2DMCTF scrims. I was locked in their roster, so I decided to go AWOL.<br>
<br>
(Unemployed) Charles: I started to play without the GU tag due to my disappointments with our performance. My opinion on GU is that they have deteriorated a bit after Blueberry recruited and kept in some "less than respectable" players. I still love ya old members ( in case you're reading this), but some of the newer ones, meh. I started to alias in all kinds of weird ways, still frequenting HAX's CTF servers and trying to avoid contact with Cartel members so that they won't bug me into joining them a third time (HAX didn't pressure me as much).<br>
<br>
I eventually started talking to Scar and became friends with him, all while keeping in touch with Sadi and Durden and some others. We sometimes grouped up to pub all together or play with some VDuS members if we were able to find them. Sometimes, Scar and I tagged up, picked up a few other guys, and anonymously scrimmed clans. I believe this is what gave some of VDuS and former-BMC members a bad reputation with pDs (not all of pDs, VDuS, or BMC, though.<br>
<br>
I created LBC as a semi-serious clan, standing for "Low Budget Clan".  Scar, Sadistical, Tuna, and Con joined rather quickly, while I picked up a few members such as Chang (who I found bunnyhopping and pwning in HAX's server named as 'player', dead serious. People asked me for weeks who he really was, and I told them that I don't know. Turns out he wasn't really aliasing, but that he was a veteran HL1DM player) and Bike for CAL when they announced their CTF league. Of course, CAL CTF kinda signified that HL2DMCTF's scrim scene was dead, and once TF2 came out, it died out in pubs completely. However, LBC proved a formidable team for even VDu$W in HL2DMCTF (I believe we beat them in warpath_b4 pre-season), so Seagull and the rest of the VDuS gang decided to let me in.<br>
<br>
And today, staying as [VDuS] Charles: I had my doubts at first because I personally felt that they did not test me enough. I didn't know if Yard_Guy and some of the other older members felt that I belonged, so I would seldomly play without the tag.<br>
<br>
I started to get better and better in vanilla DM, and one day, Yard said "Why don't you put your tag on?" This made me happy. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

	<div class="content">I used to play CS heavily back in the day.  I picked up the game when it was in its first few beta releases, thought it blew and so went on to try other HL1 mods.  CS grew to be a little bit bigger, and I came back to it, mostly because of friends who wanted to play it.  We started a clan called [MGS], which is an acronym for Metal Gear Solid, I was Liquid Snake, a friend of mine was Solid Snake.  I played CS...old-school CS...addictively.  Me and my friend ended up being friends with a guy we played with named "Hated."  At my friends suggestion to mess around, he changed his name to "Outcast" and I changed mine to "Rejected."  I didn't like lower case so I went all caps.  So off and on I've occasionally used it for my names.  I just happened to play with that name in HL2DM when I first started, and actually wanted to change it.  But as I started to play with others more, I didn't want to change my name up on them or they wouldn't know who I was.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have a lot of other 'main' names I use in other various types of games, and 'REJECTED' has no reflection on my real life.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well lets see...  Ive had the Z3R0 name for a while... And my first online game was hl2dm So that was the one I used since I used the same name in forums at the time. Shortly thereafter I had been more into the music and becoming a DJ so there it was. DJ Z3R0 And thats pretty much how its stayed for all other games. Now for the Crowbar Ninja part. <br>
<br>
Back in my MfYa days on our server there was this one map.. i think it was called fullhouse, and one night we all just basically went 'fuck it' and did the whole map crowbars only. After some time we had the full lengh benny hill song and made it a sort of rule in the server that it was only melee when that song came up.  <br>
<br>
So, anyway, On one of the many times we were in fullhouse I think it was Bloo Roo who started the Crowbar Ninja thing. So it kind of stuck with me, plus i seemed to always dominate those rounds. It seemed appropiate.<br>
<br>
So there it is.  Crowbar Ninja DJ Z3R0.<br>
<br>
By the way I'm actually a DJ at this point in time and my name is not the same only similar and more.. normal.    ZerO   And my aliases are just sillyness for those who have seen them. xD</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@DJ Zero what music do you spin? please tell me you've got records and are not a cd-dj...just a personal gripe of mine. i hate cd-dj's. <br>
i have a couple crates and tech12's/vestax06&amp;rane54/shure m447 i'm a scratch nerd if you will. <br>

i'm in the market for a loop pedal, but work&amp;school&amp;wife= limited time. PM if you're interested in cd-r trades. all that z-share/rapid share shit i'm not up on.<br>
<br>
my name in CS used to be URN8P2 (you are an ape too)<br>
played 1.something 3 or 5 the one before steam without the galil or famas. i was a fucking crack head for that game. there was a cyber cafe across the street from my job in SF, and man did go there every mofucking day to play. i got decent and joined a local clan of  highschool kids. it was comical. didn't even have intenet at my apartment so it was a weekday thing like it is here, now with the ocasional allnight drink and yell obscenities into the mic.<br>
<br>
my name now is old time no.7 as it relates to the sweet smokey tennesee sour mash bourbon which used to flow down my gullet a lot more than it does these days.<br>
The real name of jack daniels is "old no.7 brand"...but the word brand just kinda makes it sound not as good. so there is a line from an MF doom song, nasty like that old time no.7, just stuck in my head and well it's been there ever since.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I am 10 years older than you with a kid tho.</div></blockquote>

Still playing the game with people with kids (and grandkids) still feel makes me like a kid. ^^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@DJ Zero what music do you spin? please tell me you've got records and are not a cd-dj...just a personal gripe of mine. i hate cd-dj's. <br>
i have a couple crates and tech12's/vestax06&amp;rane54/shure m447 i'm a scratch nerd if you will. <br>
i have crates of old soul/hip hop/dnb/lots of comedy records-rudy raymore and lenny bruce especially. what do you listen to play? do you play out anywhere? <br>
i'm in the market for a loop pedal, but work&amp;school&amp;wife= limited time. PM if you're interested in cd-r trades. all that z-share/rapid share shit i'm not up on.<br>

</div></blockquote>

Oh yea, I used to not like CD DJ's either but I 've grown to accept it, since transporting x hours woth of music is easier in cd than in vinyl. <br>
Buut!!  <br>
Originally I started with vinyl and still love to play whatever vinyls I have, I have vinyls in house, trance and rave music, which I should expand to hip hop If I want to play in more clubs or play longer...  The stuff that I have is old school tho. Two 1200's MK2's that are at least 10 years old and still work. an older mixer, The name it has on there is Atlanta 6, old amp and big ol' Technics Speakers.  I added a CD player recently as well. <br>
<br>
I have my own radio show in my college radio station. The station has 2 1200 MK5's and a dual Denon CD player all attatched to a Santon Mixer.  So thats basically all that I use <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sad thing was, I loved her and she loved me. I respected her and I think over a 3 month period we kissed once. I don't care who you are, I don't think there is really too young of an age to love. Story turns out happy though, we are back together! :)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">What would you like to see in the OB update for hl2dm?<br>
Game updates, Game modes, New maps? (dods's new map is a custom that valve took and made a bit better) Weapon updates.<br>
<br>
<br>
1) custom server list.  (listing that a server is a low grav server)<br>
2) Make RPG able to be shot down by bullet fire (see HL2 single player,  Maybe only using the ar2 or something) Or catchable,  Or like the pyro update where the grav gun could pulse it away.<br>
3) Make biohazard and lostarena stock<br>
4) Make a GUI for entering the server, joining teams, and a bind in options and default key to bring that menu up so people can join spectator.<br>
5) 1v1 game mode<br>
6) ready team command<br>
7) Take dm_caverns_r1 make it pretty and release it (with permission i guess)<br>
<img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> Global rank system<br>
9) take some ideas from pro The server admin gui was amazingly great<br>
10) Bring back multi pulse when facing 90 degrees down.<br>
11) Fix prop clipping<br>
12) Make the slams one a piece <br>
13) fix the jerky motion that hapens when you touch a wall and floor.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
all i can think of for now,  Let brain storm and then make a vote for a top 5 or 10.  So real free to repeat any that you like</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

true,  but that would likely be the way they would go.  Also would give a rise to stock servers...i would think.  As if you wanted low grav etc you'd have to goto custom section. which i would love,  Like last night i was trying to pub and went to like 5 different servers that had low grav on stock maps....before just giving up and joining the war room.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Come on dudes, you can't wish those things. Don't wish HL2DM updates because they WON'T do that kind of updates. They're just going to port HL2DM to Source2007, that means we might get servers working at 100tick, a new LagCompensation system, graphic engine update, Stats/Achievements, score showing up with avatars, Friends name system, zoom-in-at-killer when got killed, etc. I hope they fix props, 100tick, jumpcrouch glitch, auto-reloading when switching to other weapon, xbox in the ground with no more bows when it has some, multiple SLAMs when picking one only, third RPG rocket unguided, etc.<br>
<br>
If I wish something, it would be like nino said. Make GravGun able to reflect rockets and smg1_nades, or/and able to catch them. And make orbs able to kill their own thrower, or make a cvar enabling it. One-on-one mode, Spectator GUI (plus health updating and deathnotice self relocating), more multiplayer options in the actual one, dm_lockdown FAN-switch-activating kill recognizing and others.

I agree with onty whats up with people trying to turn this into quake. I rather like the lack of FOV and all that crap that just makes the difference between a config tweaker and a normal player. <br>
Also about including custom maps in the game why bother? I mean if you do that people will just get addicted to the stock ones then when we release a revision they will resist the change like lockdown. This game really has good acceptance for custom maps and vast majority of servers run them. So the good old including maps with the game really is not needed and may even hurt. <br>
<br>
Stick to bug fixes I say then at least valve will have some consensus as to what people want. I think 95% of the people can agree that impulse * should be cheat protected, and models should stop glitching during duck jump. But you start to dive into highly opinionated things like map choice and client side rendering and you tread into controversial waters. then all valve sees is a mixed bag of fighting factions and they aren't really sure what to work on. And when you want added fluff for server admins and so on you get into they are dedicating time to that rather then fixing the real core bugs that effect every single game every day we play. Given how little valve does we should be conservative in what we ask for.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yea maybe ar2 shoot it down, but not every weapon. xbow can explode a rocket, im sure you guys know that. and i think that if you could catch smg nade or rocket would be cool, but not needed (maybe pulse). they would change the game play way to much so then it would make every weapon obsolete except for the shotgun and i guess mag...other than that fix the crashes...<br>

I do agree with you though. It's good to hear people's opinion and stuff, but I think we should concentrate on the stuff most want or the game needs right now.

CPL|Chris was working with valve and I For updates and fixes for the Fios tournament <br>
Chris through valve requesting a bunch of demos of different things including Bhopping, multi-pulsing, nade cooking, fast shottie, Flying mode, and a bunch of other exploits or tricks in the game at the time.  Then when they made some fixes and updates,  He sent the code to me to test out and invite some other players to play around on the server.  Me and about 8 other players the were on my x-fire played for about 5 hours or so on and off.<br>
<br>
I still have the demo.... i'm sure it doesn't work, didn't try it with the demo-loader...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Most the stuff I would like to see has already been posted, but if there was one thing I would like to see It would be the addition of a func_ladder entity for mappers. The ladder system in dm is retardo and slow. Notice that I said an addition, not change. I dont want older maps to become unplayable so they would need to add it as another option for ladders and not a total rehaul.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Any way im happy with the rpg as it is but would be interesting may be if we could un guide it it will be shots like in quake with rpg mid air shots allot making it easyier since of with our one u have to keep the crosshair on target unlike shotting it like the xbow.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
id really like to see improved hit registration.<br>
<br>
we should be asked to send our dump files to valve for analysis and then valve could finally do something about the crashes. <br>
<br>
the number 1 cause of pausing a game is the looping sound bug. fix it! <br>
<br>
fix the scoreboard! a team should be punished for a team kill, not awarded! lol! <br>
<br>
fix the impulse bug!<br>
<br>
fix the rpg reload bug that causes the third rocket to fly in a straight line. <br>
<br>
when you join a server a gui should pop up asking you to choose a team (combine, rebel, spectator). this gui should also be made accessable at all times.<br>
<br>
fix the missing model animation (aka jesus pose)<br>
<br>
the in game options menu should have a wide range of crosshairs with differents shapes, sizes and colours.<br>
<br>
we want new maps. if you cant be arsed, at least put some of the popular custom maps in the game so more people get to play on em!<br>

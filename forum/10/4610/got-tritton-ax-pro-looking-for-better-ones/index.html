	<div class="content">Hi.<br>
So I just received these Tritton AX Pro 5.1 <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826235005&amp;cm_re=tritton_ax_pro-_-26-235-005-_-Product" class="postlink">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.a ... -_-Product</a> expecting them to have a good balance between sound positioning and music playback but... they are not what a i was looking for.<br>
First off, they are not that good at separating the front from the rear sounds, most of the times i can't tell if somebody is in front or behind me, although i can hear the sound of the footsteps, i might have to use them more time to get used to them but right off the box they are not good at that.<br>
The other problem i have is music, i think it was my mistake from the beginning though, since these are 8 speakers, 4 for each cup and they shouldn't be used for music since most of the music i have is in 2 channels as most people do, plus they are advertised as gaming hsets. <br>
But they aren't good while listening to movies either, even when they have 5.1 audio.<br>
<br>
Idk, they just sound like if you were inside of a can or something. Sound is not even crisp clear as some cheap old Nokia earbuds i have from a cellphone and they are not giving me the sensation of a surround sound like most home theaters do... so, i just have like 3 days with them and I'm already selling them. I've been thinking on keeping them and ordering some headphones for music but... I don't think they are worth the 150 dollars not even just for gaming.<br>
<br>
So now i need to find some other options, and i want to know if you guys have had good experiences with other headsets and what can you recommend to me.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
Btw, I'm thinking on trying these Sennheiser PC 350 Gaming Headset <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PC-350-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0012XFDWO/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=videogames&amp;qid=1258575723&amp;sr=8-3" class="postlink">http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PC-350 ... 723&amp;sr=8-3</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

From what I know it goes like this Sennheiser 350 &gt; Steelseries V2 &gt; Logitech G35. I have heard almost nothing but great things about all three but if you got the dough for the Senns I don't think you can go wrong there.

Yeah I was thinking on doing that too, I'm still testing the Trittons, turns out I haven't been able to get the 5.1 to work through the SPDIF, I was just listening to 2 channels, I read how the specification works and now i understand why but i still can't get it to work with the AC3Filter.<br>
I'm using the analog 5.1 cables right now and now I'm getting the 5.1 channels but I still need to get the optical connection to work properly, yesterday I played hl2dm and l4d2 with the analog cables plugged in and it sounded way better of course, still hard to tell if it is front or rear sounds I'm getting but now it does seem it's only a matter of getting used to them.<br>
<br>
I might get the Senns too, before selling these to compare them.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info guys, and i hope more people can comment on this <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I tried similar a long time ago with Zalman 5.1 gaming headphones- total trash, sound was tinny and hollow, no bass at all, surround was pretty much nonexistant. I eventually destroyed them for their magnets, which now adorn my fridge.<br>
<br>
After a year or so of making due with earbuds (which were again better than the Zalmans all round), i finally got round to buying a real set of phones; specifically these:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.akg.com/personal/K_701,pcatid,4,pid,1,_psmand,1.html" class="postlink">http://www.akg.com/personal/K_701,pcati ... and,1.html</a><br>
<br>
The current version is the K702, which apparently has pretty much identical sound, the only real differences being cosmetic.<br>
<br>
Sound for music is excellent, near perfect neutrality / lack of coloring across all genres, massive soundstage, very clean and solid sound overall. For gaming theyre just as good as the huge soundstage makes pinpointing sounds very precise (assuming a soundcard and surround decoder of relatively similar quality), and near silent noises off in the far distance can be reliably detected without earbleed volume levels.<br>
<br>
Of course hl2dms surround is kind of outdated and rather mushy compared to newer games, so the end effect isnt quite as spectacular, but its still worlds above gaming headphones and the like.<br>
<br>
Sennheiser, Audio Technica and a few others also make strong phones that work well for both gaming and music. Best to avoid companies that put more than 2 speakers in their phones or who only target the gaming market, as their stuff is almost always inferior or junk.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I forgot what they are called, I think some HL2:DM players have them though...<br>
<br>
Admittedly the look of the size of the Barracuda was intimidating at first because I thought Id have a weight on my head, but they are fairly comfortable and fine. I usually have my beanie on that goes over my ears and then the headset on over that and everything works well. <br>
<br>
Also there is a lower end 7.1 headset without the fancy onboard sound card and crap. Haven't really looked into the differences as I have a Fata1ty sound card And Id wonder if Id get any improvement with the Megaladon over the Carcharias, but who knows.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The sound is nice, but very bassy, need to turn it down almost all the way to hear in-game footsteps and stuff... They go from 7.1 to 2.1 with the click of a button...

Its nonsense that just distortion blows speakers.<br>

<br>
Within the last year he was having a hard time finding work, got a good job and lost it due to an accident.  He got hooked on painkillers of all sorts after that, god bless America's doctors and Prescription companys. <br>
<br>
With the financial issues and habit, he loss custody of his children and moved in with his parents not to long ago.  I recall him trying to re-download his games on dial-up <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":-(" title="Sad"><br>
<br>
We spoke not to long ago, but not for long.  I recall making up an excuse to leave the conversation because it was turning into quite the novel.  Something I won't forget or live down now.  I bailed on a friend.  <br>
<br>
May god have mercy on all our souls.  Blessed be P!ke.  <br>

Let's try not to get off topic here. This is honestly serious stuff. No need for arguments in this thread.</div></blockquote>
How is this off topic? He died with a needle in his arm according to edge. He has 2 daughters. I feel sorry that they are not going to grow up with their father. I find it very on topic. Im not saying he wasnt a nice guy, cause he was a very nice guy. Im simply saying my condolences go out to his family, especially his 2 girls.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Agreed, he will be missed by them and he was one of the nicest guys you'd meet in DM until you pissed him off haha. "Fuck you edge" -- Pike 2009 xD. but in all seriousness cool guy, i'm asking around more to see if I can't figure out exactly what happened, but I'm trying to not push any buttons. Well see.<br>
<br>
Edit -- It was a party he was at, some friends shot him up and then they chilled for the night. Friends went out for breakfast and he stayed behind, tried to do it himself and it didn't go so well =\.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I agree with you both.  I mean we all have people through the HL2DM who we don't get along with, but as much as we get pissed at people around here, I don't think any of us would want to see this tragedy.  I brought this up on our forums as well.  There's such a wide variety of personalities here, levels of maturity are all over the board, but seeing some of the posts in this thread leads me to believe several of us do have respect for other players in the game.  P!ke was a great guy with two beautiful little girls, things we sometimes don't realize in this game, is life away from it.  He will be missed greatly!!!   Grieving is done differently by all, so I hope all who are saddened by this, have a quick healing!<br>

sounds like a bad dose to me.  prolly was cut with some fucked up shit.  <br>
<br>
i didnt know him that well, but this is common with heroin users that get clean and then relapse.  they use as much as they were using b4 they got clean and their tolerance is no where near what it was, so they OD.  im sure it was one of those 2 that killed him.  FUCK.  ive known so many ppl that have had heroin issues, and a lot of them are no longer here.  its such a fucked up drug.  its a "chaser" drug.  you constantly chase that original high until you dont even use to get high, you use to not be dope sick.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
seems a lot of ppl talked to him that night.  you cant blame yourselves.  i talk to EE members daily.  if they say they have to go, i hardly, if ever, ask where they are going.  if they tell me, fine, if not, its really none of my business.  you guys and girls that were close to him shouldnt feel responsible.  i think we should take this as a valueable lesson that you never know what the future holds and that we should chearish everyday.  mostly never take for granted the friendships we have all made here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

In the deep dark hours in the UK when I couldnt sleep, i used to play Pikes Mid West Server and always had some good games with the guy. He always sounded wrecked on the Mic, but never failed to put a smile on my face.<br>

To his family, know that his company and unique personality was appreciated and enjoyed as far afield as europe via this game. The world seemingly looses another gamer and good guy, but more importantly, a father.

	<div class="content">He was a good friend on steam.... not just dm but basically if I logged on he was there... Tom, Rachkir, and myself for a long time all talked shit about each other... hated one another for a while and somehow managed to stay friends.<br>
I told him I'd be getting a computer to match his for COD6. I helped him spec that thing out over a 2 month span.... him calling me about this or that... sending me links. I just about wrang his neck during the 8 hours between 10pm and 6am we spent on the phone putting that thing together.<br>
If I had any regret it would be how I left the L4D team him and I created. It wasn't good enough for me. To play with friends and have fun wasn't good enough... I wanted to be lete. Pretty much only now I can see that he was a loyal friend. If I asked him for something... to do something... pretty much anything. He would have.<br>
As far as him having problems... yeah. I knew about all that. Hell I helped him build that pc and we talked everyday. This is when he was working. He talked about pills. I dunno. I could have said something...even if he told me to fuck myself and laughed he might have thought about it later. Pills scare me anyway... surprised me. My sister has drug problems. Her daughter keeps her in line... but only while she's around. I think this could be a big part of it too. Something that would have boiled over long ago had it not been for him having the kids with him.<br>
<br>
Anyway man, P!ke, you'll be in my friends list 100,000 days offline my friend. Just wish you were P!ke instead of US Beef. When I go I will have to make sure my steam name is in order.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
<br>
I have a friend in my friends list, Thomas R. Pike II aka P!ke, <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997137576" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997137576</a> . This past weekend Tom passed away unexpectedly and quite tragically. <a href="http://www.fox6now.com/news/witi-090803-waukesha-drugs,0,351826.story" class="postlink">http://www.fox6now.com/news/witi-090803 ... 1826.story</a><br>
<br>
What I'd like to ask, on behalf of his friends and community of gamers is 2 things if you can do this and/or pass it along.<br>
Firstly, if you could, change his steam name back to "P!ke", as it now reads US beef. He had that name in only a passing comedic gesture and we'd all like to see it returned back to what we know him by. Second, if you would allow his account to continue as is or in some locked state as a tribute. I am not aware of how long an account exists if inactive. I was surprised to find mine after 2 years of not playing.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to read this unorthodox request,<br>

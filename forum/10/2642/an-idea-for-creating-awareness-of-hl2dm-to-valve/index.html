	<div class="content">They are in business to make money from making games.  You dont make money by updating 10 year old games over and over.  You make money by making and selling new games which is where they will spend their time.  Unless they care to make a HL3DM, they have no way of making money on DM.  Most likely given the relatively small player base that is going to buy EP3 anyway, why would they waste their time.  <br>
<br>
As sad as it makes me to say it, I doubt HL2DM is going to get any major upgrades or new versions.  As much as we all love it, HL2DM is not a money maker.  Most people prefer noobish games that are easy to learn, not ones that have an extremely high learning curve that is only achievable by people who can play 60+ hours a week and are mosty between the ages of 15-24.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm not saying they are evil, bad, etc. They are just busy on making newer games... HL2DM was made only by a guy who added HL2SP a MP mode. With time, they added new maps and weapons, spectator mode, and fixed a few bugs. Now it's all gone.<br>

The only hope is to get HL2DM into Source2007. Maybe there's a chance there, lol.<br>

Valve already know they failed, they released the game for free.<br>

If you want to leave, just do so without crying the sky is falling to the people who still enjoy playing. There were people posting this exact same thing over 2 years ago when the first season of CAL ended. Fortunately not everyone listened to the naysayers.<br>
<br>
From our guidelines:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Additionally, please do not make threads or posts announcing that you are quitting the game. This is unnecessarily demoralizing to the community, and often ends with the quitter being found playing not long after making the announcement.</div></blockquote>

I have tried playing other games, and you know what? They interest me for about 2 months and then I come back to dm. When I find one that can hold my attention like hl2dm has (for the 3+ years I might add) maybe I will move on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

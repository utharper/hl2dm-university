There is no one willing to make #hl2dm an all inclusive  gaming chat room, so im encouraging all  who disagree with this nonsense, to  stay away from this  chat room.<br>

I dont care about backlash on this.  After  all this  the Internett!<br>

	<div class="content">That's a point Conflict.  But there are people trying to get more people in the channel not less.<br>
<br>
I understand Impalas being offended by some of the convos going on at times but the other 30 people in the room either think its funny, or they don't care.  I just go do something else, like play when I get bored of the converstion  or it holds no interest for me.<br>
<br>
I am not sure if we want the ops to have to start being policeman in the channel nd coming down with a hard fist on the "offenders".  I suppose we do to some extent though.  But we are not watching every minute to make sure everyone plays nice. Most of the people in there old enough to not act like children.  On the other hand I have never seen any dicussion on what is "correct" behavior/conversation in the channel other than the fact the Grape gets banned a lot.  I have also seen a lot of shit talk back and forth and no one gets banned for it.  Do they need to be?  I really am not sure.  <br>
<br>
In any case there probably should be an informal set of guidelines for ops to follow when people get out of line.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Does it really matter in the grand scheme of things?   He acts like that cause he can.  He doesnt want to have a filter, he feels that the "rules" (for lack of a better term) most of us live by dont apply to him.    The more you go against him the more he pushes back, its just the way he is.  W/E to each his own.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Try this - shoot an smg nade, and immediately change to gravity gun and primary fire. You will blow up your own smg grenade.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think a lot of this stuff is animation weirdness. Like, if you mag someone just as they orb. You here the sound and even see it.<br>
Same with rpg. They die just as it comes out. With some lag, someone could literally die inside the rpg as it comes out.<br>
Nihilus said he has shot an smg nade just as it came out.<br>
I think it is more of a glitch. The player died, the game couldn't easily decide what to do with the shot.<br>
As for shotgunning a nade in mid air, i have never seen it happen or done it.<br>
Maybe folks are just leet like that.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"><br>
And i never believed you could shoot an rpg. The rpg seems to fly and collide or time out and that is all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You are right in that these type of things tend to happen as soon as they "spawn", like shooting an smg nade as soon as it comes out. But I don't think it's because the player died and the game couldn't decide. A lot of the time, the majority actually, when an smg nade is shot down, it blows up in the person's face but it does not kill them.<br>
<br>
For RPG it seems to be different. As Edge said, we tested it with a really really slow rpg, we shot it with every weapon available, even thew a grenade at it, and it didn't blow up or even change course.<br>
<br>
Something interesting was discovered though. When Edge was directing the really slow RPG, we killed him. We thought that the RPG missile would then keep going as usual until it hit something and it blew up. Well, Edge came back and picked up the RPG he had dropped and regained control of the missile that was still in midair. Very interesting, though it has no use in a match at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So the rpg was assigned to him in some way. Even after he died, it looked for his control.<br>
Freaky. Really strange.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

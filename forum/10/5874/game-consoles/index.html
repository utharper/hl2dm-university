	<div class="content">Thinking about getting a game console for the kids and maybe for this big kid. What console do you guys use? What one is best for fps games? I really don't know much about them. I haven't had one for a long time. I heard that the ps3 and xbox 360 were the best. Not sure about the wii.  Any help would be great.   Thanks</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">360 still has the best online fps experience, but you're paying a monthly subscription fee. <br>
ps3 is a solid all around choice.<br>
With Nintendo games, either you love 'em of you hate 'em. If you're envisioning your whole family sitting on the couch playing together, get a Wii. That's what they're made for.<br>
<br>
<br>
With that said, just ask your kids!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">PS3 has more better exclusives than Xbox I would say, Uncharted, Killzone, God of War, infamous, Heavy Rain, Metal gear and more.<br>
<br>
The multiplat games are usually perform better on Xbox <br>
PSN is free so no need for fees but it shows but the paid service PSN+ is a joke they cant even make it so your game saves upload in  the back ground after exit the game nor sync your trophies (if thats your thing) as you earn them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've owned all three and I have to say Xbox has been the funnest, except I hate paying the xbox live subscription fee, but I also really enjoy the PS3 for some of the exclusive games, Resistance: Fall of Man was one of my favorites <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">   But the Xbox will come a lot cheaper than a PS3, but the Subscriptions can cost a lot, depending if you buy Year by year, month to month, or every 3 months.  Also the xbox can be exploited to play pirated games for free online 100% working, which is the main reason I still have it.  It's called "Xbox flashing" and I would look into it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree with cheese. The Xbox is really good for online fps games but the downer is the fee for xbox live. The ps3 is a multimedia monster, I have two, one to watch blu ray movies in the living room and the other in my room to play games plus theres no need to pay for the online service and it has good exclusives. The Wii is really fun for kids or a night with the family but it lacks some features and only has a few good exclusives like Mario galaxy, zelda and metroid. Personally I still prefer the ps3 because it offers the biggest bang for your buck and you cant go wrong with the build quality of sony products which is more than I can say for my xbox that died after the first year with it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

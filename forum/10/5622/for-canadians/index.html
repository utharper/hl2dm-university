Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are about to impose usage-based billing on YOU.<br>
<br>
This means we're looking at a future where ISPs will charge per byte, the way they do with smart phones. If we allow this to happen Canadians will have no choice but to pay MUCH more for less Internet. Big Telecom companies are obviously trying to gouge consumers, control the Internet market, and ensure that consumers continue to subscribe to their television services.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">What is this about?</strong><br>
<br>
When we log onto the Internet, we take a lot for granted. We assume we'll be able to access any Web site we want, whenever we want, at the fastest speed, whether it's a corporate or mom-and-pop site. We assume that we can use any service we like -- watching online video, listening to podcasts, sending instant messages -- anytime we choose. What makes all these assumptions possible is Net Neutrality.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Who wants to get rid of Net Neutrality?</strong><br>
<br>
The nation's largest telephone and cable companies -- including AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast and Time Warner Cable -- want to be Internet gatekeepers, deciding which Web sites go fast or slow and which won't load at all.<br>
<br>
They want to tax content providers to guarantee speedy delivery of their data. And they want to discriminate in favor of their own search engines, Internet phone services and streaming video -- while slowing down or blocking services offered by their competitors.<br>
<br>
These companies have a new vision for the Internet. Instead of a level playing field, they want to reserve express lanes for their own content and services -- or those of big corporations that can afford the steep tolls -- and leave the rest of us on a winding dirt road.<br>
<br>
The big phone and cable companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to gut Net Neutrality, putting the future of the Internet at risk.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's one of the things I admire about South American countries - shits not right, people raise hell until something happens.<br>
Here - people are too fucking busy playing around on Facebook, reading Twilight, and watching American fucking Idol to pay attention to the fact that they are getting royally fucked in the corn hole.  Net neutrality has been on the verge of being shit on for the last couple of years and I can guaran-goddamn-tee you 99.8% of Americans has no fucking clue what the issue is or how it will affect them in the long run.  All the while dipshit politicians, greedy fucking corporate lawyers and board members meet behind closed doors to decide which type of anal lube to use.

You know as a true moderate (I've tallied my voting as a dead-even 50/50 ticket to republican/democrat throughout my voting history) I have to say you're dead wrong here. This is truly a conglomerate of financially self-interested corporations (RIAA and partners) vs a still liberal minded (liberal in the classical sense which would mean republican today) government where government intervention would actually be good. Mind=blown? Go read up; oh wait you won't do it, fuck it then I quti.<br>
<br>
Problem is liberty has yet to come to hard drawn definitions in terms of the internet which has become liberty itself. Unfortunately you don't realize that financially minded corporations will censor and block their way to profit much like monarchies did. Then again your generation is the past and we are the future, and time has shown us the future generations win so I will not worry about progressive constitutions involving the rise of a legally stable free internet.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Maybe you could name me ONE business that isn't self interested? Maybe find that one and make sure it is not in the investment portfolio.<br>

I stand by my analysis that this issue is NONSENSE. That there IS no massive problem with slowdowns or stopping acces to anything.<br>
It is a lot of Leftist crap, designed to seize control over the Internet.<br>
<br>
My view is, everything is working just fine, maybe more competition is good.<br>
More Gubbmint in our internet is BAD.<br>
<br>
If anyone here would like to mount an argument that more Gubbmint in the Internet is a GOOD THING and argue that there IS A massive problem, i will hear that and dismantle that.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I guarandamntee you that wherever you find problems with crappy internet, there is probably a gubbmint monopoly there, for whatever reason.<br>
Get busy pushing to open up markets, to lower prices, to bundle better packages and DISABUSE Yourself of this notion business is charity, or should be concerned with liberty or any other nonsense.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have generally been against more government regulation and control of our lives but this net neutrality issue is likely one we need. The thing is many people don't understand it because it hasn't fully blown up yet, but it likely will in the near future without some protections put into place.<br>
 We all know that the big corporations are trying to do one thing and that is make billions more at our expense and looking forward what is the most likely needed thing that could generate those billions?, the internet and bandwidth.<br>
 Net neutrality goes farther than protecting us from internet rape though, it can also be looked at as a way of protecting our freedom.<br>
<br>
Below is a copy of a post from another board discussing the issue, from a person who is in favor of NN and why. People who are against NN but in favor of protecting their freedoms might want to read it as it explains it pretty well.<br>
<br>
Copy from Hard forums written by member Zarathustra[H]<br>
<br>
I should preface this with that I am very heavily in favor of net neutrality, and I feel like the FCC did not go far enough in this ruling, but I can see where some of the side effects may arise.<br>
<br>
It relies on political appointees to write rules for what traffic may be managed and what traffic may not be managed on backbone systems. If this is written incorrectly, it could hamper attempts to limit or block abuses of the network. Because of this, great care must be taken when the rules are written. I generally don't trust government enough to believe that they can write these things correctly, but IMHO even if they get it slightly wrong, the pros far outweigh the cons in this case.<br>
<br>
Some might also argue that the laws are superflous. In a way these FCC regulations are a new form of protection of free commerce and free markets and a limitation of monopolistic behaviors as regards the internet. Let's say Verizon blocks or lowers access speeds to the extent of unusability, or charges extra fees for access to Netflix, in order to protect their own pay per view system. I think we can all agree this would be bad for competition. You could - however - argue that we already have laws prohibiting monopolistic behaviors. <br>
<br>
The problem with these laws is that they are not specific enough to network traffic, and because of their broadness and vagueness often take years if not decades in court before they are resolved. (Take the Microsoft issue as an example) In the meantime, new ideas could be stifled in their tracks, and scared away to other markets where they have more network freedom, creating the next billion dollar google or facebook in Europe instead of here. Not to mention the harm it does to consumer choices. With more specific FCC rules violations of this sort could be dealt with more swiftly. That being said, there will likely be a lot of legal wrangling up front before we reach that state.<br>
<br>
Current monopoly laws also would not apply to political wrangling. For instance, if Verizon didn't like a certain political candidate, and feared they might vote for more ISP regulation, they could simply block their ads from getting through, or block their political webpages and emails, thus harming the political process, the very source of our freedom as a nation.<br>
<br>
There is precedent here. Current telecommunication laws prevent telephone companies from blocking access to, or discrimination against calling certain numbers (like political rivals, or market competitors), but it does not specifically apply to the internet.<br>
<br>
The biggest issue - IMHO - with the FCC rules right now is that they don't apply to mobile networks (and we all know which direction the market is going, at least for non-techie consumer use).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

For instance, if Verizon didn't like a certain political candidate, and feared they might vote for more ISP regulation, they could simply block their ads from getting through, or block their political webpages and emails, thus harming the political process, the very source of our freedom as a nation.<br>
<br>
There is precedent here. Current telecommunication laws prevent telephone companies from blocking access to, or discrimination against calling certain numbers (like political rivals, or market competitors), but it does not specifically apply to the internet.<br>
<br>
The biggest issue - IMHO - with the FCC rules right now is that they don't apply to mobile networks (and we all know which direction the market is going, at least for non-techie consumer use).</div></blockquote>

Citations and bibliography next time please. Nah, jk I actually read all the way through that and generally agree. The internet is the new freedom of the world and it needs a constitution of some sort, preferably not one drafted by a conglomerate of internet CEO's.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">First off, Canadians being charged by the byte and getting fucked or whatever has nothing to do with Net Neutrality.<br>
<br>
Right now, Internet providers set aside portions of bandwidth for large business users and charge them through the ass.<br>
The owners of the bandwidth reserve an amount for ENTERPRISE users, Companies, Hospitals...that have important business traffic. Maybe YOUR workload.<br>
<br>
So, here come ASSHOLES who LOVE Gubbmint to get all up in and FUCK UP everything, that want bandwidth used for DLing Music and Watching TV (Which was meant for the Cable traffic in the first place), is treated JUST LIKE Premier Enterprise users.<br>
<br>
As there will always a finite supply of anything except stupidity, folks are all pantywadded that 4Chan will be slowed down, access to certain sites cut off ...ALL THIS FUCKING NONSENSE that has never happened and never will as long as there is folks paying for bandwidth.<br>
<br>
Net Neutrality is Solution in search of a Problem.<br>
It's a Load of crap, made up. A Power grab by Gubbmint so THEY CAN control the internet.<br>
Always be careful of what you ask for.<br>
<br>
SO, HERE is one unintended consequence: Forced to apportion bandwidth the Soviet Way, ISPs will just refuse to carry large chunks of garbage, like 4 chan and Porn. Stop carrying Netflicks. <br>
<br>
Yep. If you seize control over the apportionment, a certain backlash will occur.<br>
The ISPs OWN these networks, not the Gubbmint.<br>
<br>
But go ahead. Bitch and Moan we need more Gubbmint like a bunch of fucking Pussies and see what you get.<br>
All your good intentions will probably fuck it all up for everybody because you have these false Marxist beliefs that the Internet is any different from any Good or Service.<br>
<br>
Frankly, you little gubbmint loving Leftist pantywaist fools make me sick.<br>
I'd like to punkslap every one of you faggots.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So in this hypothetical free country (none really exist to this day) business are allowed to turn a profit at the expense of censorship? Also a CSS bud of mine has his internet suspended for downloading a torrent and has to go back a "probationary period with monitoring" for a month or so to get back in full graces.

For one nothing can stop DDoS attacks, nothing if the person is ambitious enough. Not even the most elite corporations and government defenses are able to stop it. Secondly what happens as it often is if there is only at most two ISP's in the area you live, and all are beginning to practice site blocking? Who to go to anymore?<br>
<br>
Lastly I don't want to live in fucking China where government AND corporations get to block whatever sites they deem harmful to government face, and harmful to corporation profit. I'd rather die with my freedom or become a largely irrelavent free country like Sweden then become China. The reason I say this is because in China there has a developed a reciprocal relationship between ISP's and government, the Chinese government has allowed ISP's unlimited power to block whatever sites they choose as long as they "listen" to suggestions of sites the government wants blocked. <br>

<br>
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.<br>
You pay for levels of service or bandwidth. Working on lines is part of their budget and business plan.<br>
If bandwidth becomes scarce, supply and demand is still in effect, the gubbmint can do nothing at all to ensure X's service is treated like Ys service.<br>

The point of Net Neutrality is to treat unequally important demands equally, a constant leftist theme.<br>
In other words, PORN should be treated with the same priority as your Business website or a Hospitals bandwidth for medical recording.<br>
<br>
It's absurd. Leftists are absurd. Just the stupidest people on earth.<br>
And then there is the simple elegant demand that there be a real big problem before resorting to Gubbmint takeovers and the that argument is so weak as to be laughable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

EDIT: Ya know, I always figured that, with the way the internet has grown, 10 to 15 years from now it will be blazing fast and EVERYWHERE.  You'll be able to get internet anywhere, and it'll be ridiculously fast, wireless or wired.  Phones will be such processing brutes that you'll have a full version of windows on it and all other kinds of crazy shit.  I'm not sure, now, with how companies are, if that's going to happen or be delayed a long time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's MY word. I almost always use it instead of Government, because Government denotes some kind of governing going on, which we all know is bullshit. There are powerplays. There is no governing. That would mean passing balanced budgets, keeping an eye on lending standards, regulating in a reasonable manner, IE doing their limited duties.<br>
<br>
But, if you folks want to hand over incredible unlimited power to Gubbmint, than, i believe you are a fool.<br>
-------------------<br>
Verizon says REDUCE SPEEDS occasionally during peak hours to ensure everyone has access and bandwidth. Why does this sound perfectly reasonable to me but is the end of Internet "freedom" "Rights", whatever.<br>
I thought the argument was that sites were being BLOCKED, that it is a big problem, and Gubbmint needs to step in.<br>
That argument is lame in the first place and now seems to morph into "Reducing speeds occasionally if needed" ridiculousness.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

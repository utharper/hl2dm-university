We have actually been playing on ag2 a lot and prefer it to regular dm. The hitreg is really good and we have been doing our scrims there. So im not sure what you mean by that statement you made. I havent even gotten on regular dm since I downloaded Ag2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Even with OB fixes, it's still just DM with little match support.<br>

The other modes (fugitive)  and Pro mod, along with the browser and map/match/crosshair... options make it superior to Valve and OB in every way.<br>
<br>
Even if leagues and what not don't take off, i'd like to see more folks pubbing and Pro'ing in AG2.<br>
It's even easier to install than OB.<br>
<br>
What i hear are little things, sounds are different, the weapons feel different.<br>
It's QUITE different from DM, which i think is a big exaggeration.<br>
<br>
I know a lot of folks missed HLDM and Pro mod the first time around.<br>
If folks picked it up and endorsed it, that would breath some life in.<br>

Mag is THE weapon in AG2 as well. AG2 actually has better hitreg than OB, if you can believe it, which you probably can not.</div></blockquote>

Getting 5 fps in any way, shape, or form is a sign that you need to start delivering pizza's on the side and build a better PC. You silly-silly boy you.  <br>
Removing and/or modifying a decal or client file is illegal as a policy-wide standard. All FPS leagues function this way.
<blockquote><div><cite>eFPS Official Rules, Section 10, During the match wrote:</cite>4. Modified Files - Match servers must be running in sv_pure 1 mode with the whitelist from the config pack which forces all model sound texture skin and associated files to be loaded from the steam gcfs. The only modified files that will be allowed are those involving the resource folder (crosshairs / clientscheme) and the cfg folder (configs). Servers unable to run in sv_pure 1 mode for whatever reason are not acceptable for match play. Furthermore if a match is proven to have been held in non sv_pure 1 moden or dosen't have a whitelist the match is to be completely replayed. However this should not be a problem if playing on eFPS Servers.</div></blockquote> <br>
I had a HUDanimations.txt that went in the script folder of my hl2mp that was made to match an all-white-colored-HUD. <br>
As a side effect, it eliminated all pain-effects such has blood-shot or hazard whitewash. <br>
<br>
Even if I suggest and submit that file to Dallas, it is likely to still be illegal to use it for the simple reason that only a select few players will have the file and some entrants (now or in the future) will not. <br>
This creates a disparity among the player base which by definition is an unfair environment for competition. <br>
<br>
I will suggest this change to J@nek and if the modification is to become stock or "Mod-Wide" then, of course, it would be legal. <br>
<br>
That is the simple reason mods/edits like this have been illegal since STA and CAL. <br>
A matter of policy for fair and balanced standardization.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Getting 5 fps in any way, shape, or form is a sign that you need to start delivering pizza's on the side and build a better PC. You silly-silly boy you.  <br>
Removing and/or modifying a decal or client file is illegal as a policy-wide standard. All FPS leagues function this way.
<blockquote><div><cite>eFPS Official Rules, Section 10, During the match wrote:</cite>4. Modified Files - Match servers must be running in sv_pure 1 mode with the whitelist from the config pack which forces all model sound texture skin and associated files to be loaded from the steam gcfs. The only modified files that will be allowed are those involving the resource folder (crosshairs / clientscheme) and the cfg folder (configs). Servers unable to run in sv_pure 1 mode for whatever reason are not acceptable for match play. Furthermore if a match is proven to have been held in non sv_pure 1 moden or dosen't have a whitelist the match is to be completely replayed. However this should not be a problem if playing on eFPS Servers.</div></blockquote> <br>
I had a HUDanimations.txt that went in the script folder of my hl2mp that was made to match an all-white-colored-HUD. <br>
As a side effect, it eliminated all pain-effects such has blood-shot or hazard whitewash. <br>
<br>
Even if I suggest and submit that file to Dallas, it is likely to still be illegal to use it for the simple reason that only a select few players will have the file and some entrants (now or in the future) will not. <br>
This creates a disparity among the player base which by definition is an unfair environment for competition. <br>
<br>
I will suggest this change to J@nek and if the modification is to become stock or "Mod-Wide" then, of course, it would be legal. <br>
<br>
That is the simple reason mods/edits like this have been illegal since STK and CAL. <br>
A matter of policy for fair and balanced standardization.</div></blockquote>

Thanks to you, everybody is already using this. I've even talked to people who've told me it's ok for them to do, solely because you said so. <br>
I mean, I guess it's better than just ewr having it. <br>
So what are you talking about? It's not like people are going to remove it now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You got it all wrong, its not the red screen that lags me, its the BLOOD SPLASH when you shoot someone or getting shot. That kind of particle lags me like hell. Yes hit reg is better in ag2 and i am used to that, im not even using the shotty like i use it in normal DM. Trust me its that blood shit that kills my fps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I made that thread and told people it "could" be used well before I was made an admin of eFPS. All I was really doing was trying to not overstep my bounds and rewrite Dallas' rules. <br>
I don't agree with the rule limiting the editing of player resources to a select few .cfg and clientscheme files. <br>
The HUDanimations.txt I submitted to hl2dmU is like any other small (but useful) piece of knowledge in this community: only the ignorant are devoid of it. <br>
That is why I disclosed the file to begin with, for I hate ignorance.<br>
<br>
I do understand why Dallas wrote the rule as it is, and was explaining and defending the current stance on said rule so that people can just understand, play, and not bicker. <br>
I probably should have remembered what-the-fucking kind community I am in. Sorry about that. <br>
Dallas does not want to loosen anything up and allow wiggle room for unfair/dishonest play. Perhaps the file I submitted can be added to the "safe-list" if enough people petition for it.<br>
<br>
I have not experienced the pain-blood effect in ag2. I have only seen it in James' OB mod and stock hl2dm, but I know it can be there. <br>
For this particular file, there really is no room for enforcement. Much like if Dallas said "no using mouse wheel," there would be no way to properly enforce such a thing. <br>

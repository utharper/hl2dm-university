<br>
There have been numerous complaints about HL2DM crashing, I know this is a typical thing for DM but it seems more than usual.  Me and two other guys were playing on my server yesterday and one guy crashed repeatedly during a certain map whereas myself and the other guy had no problem.  I have crashed on my own server before and have crashed on other servers and this all started about a month ago.  Some individuals are complaining that it's a server problem being they crash on multiple servers but I would think just the opposite.  If it's happening on multiple servers then it would be client side...right?  So I'm just curious how the game has been running for the rest of the community and what you feel might be the problem.  If it's server side, then I would really like to get it taken care of!!<br>

go into your steam folder and delete the following files.<br>
<br>
<br>
steamclient.dll<br>
clientRegistry.blob<br>
steam.dll<br>
steamUI.dll<br>
<br>
open steam, it will start downloading these files.  its like a reboot of steam.  sometimes one of those files will get corrupted.  might help, might not, but give it a try.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hate to say i told you so....But i told you so. Would love to hear Billy's and Nutri's thoughts on this. Seeing that SM qualified and had a shot at winning the tournament. It's really shitty that they miss the opportunity to show that they could possibly win the whole tournament. (not sarcasm)  I watched them win a few games against top teams , and as  i said to Billy in Firefall. I'd love for former top half life players to go up and win against former top Quake players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nothing personal man, i don't have anyone on my list and haven't for a long time. I played tribes for awhile and now firefall which do not require steam. I was thinking of selling my steam account to a friend but changed at the last minute.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's decent, a few things they need to fix before esports hits. The 1 million dollar pay out is what gets me playing the amount i do.  There's already enough drama that hl2 sees in the competitive scene. you would feel right at home. I got a beta key if you need one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

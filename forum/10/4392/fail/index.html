No not sarcasm I  mean it, it seems society cares more about dogs and cats than children.

<br>
No Keefy, in my house, we dont treat our dogs like humans, because yes they are dogs.  However our idea of treating a dog like a dog is obviously different than your idea.  I dont neglect them and beat them and treat them like a piece of shit that doesnt have feelings.  They are living beings.  Yes talking to them in a sissy high pitched voice is not really the best thing to do because a high pitched voice shows weakness because it sounds like whining.  Yelling at them is just as bad as it shows instability.  Talking in a calm, authoritative voice is best, because it expresses control and authority.<br>
 <br>
Dogs do have personalities and science is finding out that they do have feelings.    The grieve at the loss of a pack member; they feel regret over doing something wrong; they feel joy when the pack is reunited after being separated.  They also have a vocabulary of over 200 words, more than a 3 or 4 year old human.  They also understand body language, more than any human ever will.  They understand more than you apparently give them credit for.<br>
<br>
 I also apparently understand dog behavior and psychology more than you do because I have taken the time to study it so I can provide for the needs of my dogs and also so we dont have crazy, out of control dogs like so many people do.  They are pack animals and are happiest in that type of environment with leadership and the correct type of discipline.  In my house, the humans take the role of pack leaders.  We give them socialization, excercise, training, and discipline so that they know how to behave in our "pack" of 2 dogs and 2 humans.  We also give them affection when it is appropriate to reward and reinforce behavior that we want.  Also, humans and dogs can form a "pack".  They have been doing it for 1000s of years.<br>
<br>
My dogs are very well behaved and they are healthy and well adjusted canines.  We go to the point of adopting dogs from shelters which often have issues stemming from bad owners.  Our vet has given us the highest reference to the shelter as good dog owners and we have carte blanche at the shelter to adopt pretty much any dog we wish.   We bring these dogs into our home and provide them with a stable life.  Its challenging at times, but its also very rewarding to watch an unstable dog become a happy one that enjoys life.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I can understand that for sure.  We have a fenced in back yard that our dogs do their buisness in.  They can do whatever they want in there such as dig holes, because its an area we designated for them.  We are lucky to have the space to do that.  I dont want them shitting on the front yard ruining the yard and I get pissed if my neighbors dogs go there.  And yea sometimes you got to clean up after them on a walk depending where the go.   If they go in the bushes then you get excused from cleanup that time, but they dont always cooperate with you that way.<br>
<br>
Do you have your own children yet?  If so then you already know this, if not then get ready to wipe someone elses shit up until they are old enough for toilet training.   About 2 + years for that to happen.<br>
<br>
Im not crying any tears over that dog.  Its not my dog.  I do think its a damn shame it happened and I feel bad that the dog suffered.  If it had been an infant, Id have thought how stupid whomever left it in the car was.   When we domesticate animals, they become almost completely dependant on us to do the right thing for them.  If it was something other than a horrible miscommunication/mistake then the person responsible deserves to be punished in some way, according to the animal cruelty laws we have here.  <br>
<br>
And yea if youve never owned one then we really cant expect you to understand how we feel about ours.  Dogs certainly arent a pet for everyone.  They are alot of work and responsibility.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is a serious warning and we suggest you take it. This message is in response to your threat posted here:<a href="http://twiaap.com/index.php/news/To%20the%20Hackers/" class="postlink">http://twiaap.com/index.php/news/To%20the%20Hackers/</a></div></blockquote>

The irony here is that you have orchestrated through your website/s to have my site hacked and spammed. Posting all sorts of racist rubbish on there. The fact that you are worried is an admission of guilt on your part. I have already lodged a complaint with your hosting/s provider and included screenshots, and logs of links coming directly from your website/s to then spam and ddos my website. As well you have broken several laws including allowing your website/s to be used to defame my character, cyber terrorism and spamming, not to mention posting the child porn and gay porn you placed on my website. <br>
My question to you is why? The site originally was intended as a joke, a bit of harmless humour, it was never intended to scam anyone out of money, it was merely done to get the controversy and then get the traffic up, there was also an added bonus, I would then collect the ip's of those spamming and deriding the site without reason, to compare against banlists, and also those players that demonstrate suspicious activites, with the thought 1 + 1 = 2. It was designed to draw the hackers out, and boy did it succeed.<br>
The response received far outweighed the intial idea, and the fact that your supposedly neutral forum dedicated to the betterment of the gaming community as a whole is laughable, you are allowing your forums to be used for illegal activities, ddosing and spamming are clear breaches of international law, the content of the images and links that were posted not only breached half a dozen laws it begs the question, your members have access to images and content,this is a truly horrific abuse of children, and what type of people are you associated with? The fact you allow Snipeit and Kbaxter1 to use your forums as a means to their ends, says that you are perhaps scared of the power they wield, that you may somehow be less successful without their input, but I don't think this is the case. The fact that they have been banned from so many different servers and forums speaks voluimes as to their character, but if you still wish to associate yourself with these people then by all means it is your business. I suggest that you remove every post that refers to this site, and also remove the suggestions in locked posts telling people to hack my details and to share my personal details around. I would also strongly suggest you ban such members that would advocate and participate in this type of behaviour, as well perhaps to try deleting the posts where certain members ask for sites to be hacked for their own ends, here I am not referring to my site but rather to posts contained within your forum.<br>
I understand that I will probably end up being banned from your website for posting this letter, and I am likely to be mocked and abused by many of your members, but I have had my say, please note that the Karma is a Bitch comment is intended to be just that, not a threat more of a cosmic fact, that which you give you shall receive threefold, It is not intended as a threat of doing anything to your site, some of which is quite good and has a relatively good intention...end rant</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

if someone did that shit to your site, tough shit but this site and its staff are not responsible for it just because these user may or may not participate in the community. This forum is a place for all people sharing either an interest in learning, or bettering the community, and we do this by educating, not banning like the communitys you affiliate with.<br>
<br>
Joke or not, that anti-cheat shit you had up was 100% fruadulant and only encouraged ignorance within the community. I hope you die, good day sir!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No attacks were ORCHESTRATED anywhere, especially from here at HL2DU. No attacks or even posts to your site, racist or  porny or not,  originate from this website. Several folks have TALKED about how to rid the world of yet another slimy scam, I.E. your 600 dollar bogus software.<br>
<br>
It is not lost on me that you post here as "the devil" and make threats, trying as you might, to intimidate with your empty and false allegations. Like -OOOOO we are so very scared of the internet foreign legion/police raiding this gaming community education site because of discussions concerning your pathetic con game.<br>
<br>
Maybe someone should report your false advertising to someone, like I.P. Rambo, who could open up on your creepy ass with clips full of wireless missives and provider complaints of your scam on the wider gaming community.<br>
<br>
No one has attacked you. Someone posted some stuff you don't like on your crap site. Well booohoo!<br>
Call Interpol, i am sure they will take your case.<br>
<br>
Folks who are members of clans like Evil Empire and Hell's Elite are not terribly impressed when the Devil posts here. He gets his ass whooped routinely by the players on this site and you aren't really even the Devil anyways.<br>

I was never selling any software...no money was ever taken it was impossible as the link was to a non-exsistent account!!!

	<div class="content">Ok here is your response. HL2DMU does not, nor has it ever condoned an attack on your website. If there is any specific post that you do not agree with being on here, you may report it and an admin (either myself or Keeper) will review it and if we agree we will remove said post. You did so with a previous post, and I removed it as you requested. <br>
<br>
I don't know who sent that letter to you, but it was not HL2DMU. Anyone can claim to be anyone on the internet, as you well know. Email addresses can be spoofed too. The fact that we are worried? We are not worried, we didn't even send that.<br>
<br>
I have stated this over and over, we are a PUBLIC forum and do not discriminate against specific individuals or clans. Not a single board member has said or posted anything against you. The fact is, a site requesting almost $600 for an anti-cheat is obviously gonna get talked about here, and people are going to want to find out who the scam artist is. <br>
<br>
When someone mentioned attacking your site, here was my response: <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Take it to PM guys, dmu doesn't support organized attacks on other sites as you guys know from past experience.</div></blockquote>

Does this mean by me saying take it to PM I am telling them to organize it in private? No. I am not responsible for the actions of ADULTS who use these boards to communicate. Their discussion could have been a joke for all I know, but I still let them know that this site DOES NOT ENDORSE an attack on another site.<br>
<br>
I do consider this thread to be a threat, and I do not appreciate it. Enjoy the ban you anticipated. Any further threads regarding this topic, the anti-cheat site, or anything related will be instantly deleted.<br>
<br>
Individuals in the community may have been involved, but HL2DMU and it's owners has and had nothing to do with any attacks on your site.<br>
<br>
Topic closed permanently.<br>

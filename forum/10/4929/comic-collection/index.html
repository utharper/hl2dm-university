	<div class="content">Hello Univeristy Forum Contributors;<br>
<br>
I am in the process of selling off a rather extensive comic collection from my youth.  I didn't do a complete count, however I would estimate it's around 500 or so, on the safe side.  I have already sold some to local shops and figured this place might house a closet comic nerd besides myself.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in these I can email you an Excell spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Most of it is from early 90's to 2000, a few large runs from 70's and 80's and many independant publishers.  Some of which are quite popular today and were made into kid shows, which is extremely odd considering the source material is rather raunchy and had mature ratings.  i.e. fairy godmother (didnt even know i had it, just read it, and I went WTF?)<br>
<br>
I could talk forever about comics, the media, and pop culture and how it's related to what we see on tv today (cartoon wise), but I won't for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
Good day.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm not interested however you probably will have more luck selling some by going on the forums for webcomics - if you don't read any here's some:<br>
Ctr-Alt_del, slightly damned, PvP, xkcd, penny arcade, sinfest, looking for group.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i have an extensive collection of "Garbage Pail Kids". few of you are old enough to remember these gems and the feeling of walking into that 7-11 and spending all of your allowance on them.  they even came with that rock solid stick of gum.  good times. they looked something like these.  you had to have each cards "counter part" too.  <br>

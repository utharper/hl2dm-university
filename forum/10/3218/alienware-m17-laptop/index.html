Alienware a good buy for a $2100 purchase in general? Still have time to cancel the order and I am absolutely tech illiterate, but this looks to be some of the most bang for the buck as far as gaming laptops have come to see. God my classmates in college will think I'm a douche unloading a 17inch screen and basically lighting up the half of the lecture hall I sit in.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Yeah that's what I think too, however I'm a tech nub and have no idea about Alienware reliability. Otherwise I'd say save up and go for it, to me the Alienware M15x is more practicle for college(battery life, size, etc) but how can a guy pass up on a 17inch 1920x1250 Clearview HD screen, honestly? Also to me the M15x is ugly design wise and the M17x is overkill unless you buy the latest games that come out every week and hope to run them on full settings, which is not my intent.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">First of all Alienware is now owned by DELL.<br>
<br>
When I purchased mine about 6 months ago, I was able to get a DELL with better specs for the same price as an Alienware, so make sure its compatible.<br>
<br>
I ended up with a XPS 1730 because I wanted one that I could play hl2Dm and Crysiswars without having it melt down because of it.   Its only drawback is that its freaking huge and heavy.  Its thicker and wider than most 17 inch laptops.  I think because of the wider screen and the fans they put in it for cooling.   It wont fit in a standard bag for a 17 inch and I had to buy the bag that Dell makes for it.<br>
<br>
Even played a scrim with it against $W from a hotel in upstate NY (wired connection) and it worked fine.  I also played DM and Crysiswars when I was in Philly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I am trying to give information to someone asking about a laptop.<br>
My point was to show that it can work as a gaming laptop, valuable info if thats what they are looking for. <br>
I have been pretty impressed with it so far, considering its a laptop.<br>
Most laptops fail miserably in that regard because they usually overheat pretty fast.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Id go with a nice 15 inch asus or something. There are plenty of laptops out there with a decent video card like a 96-9800 Nvidia card which will play just about anything.<br>
What your looking at is overkill.<br>
And as for DELL, they are known for their tech failures. I wouldn't go that route either.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Dude it's a DELL! After nearly picking up the phone and changing the order I realised this, I'm typing this on a 4 year old laptop, a Sony Vaio 17inch AX series. After all these years the overblown technology that this was labeled to be at it's launch has aged nicely, it still runs perfect after all these years and keeps up with todays standards. In most cases, you get what you pay for and I think the M17 will last a long time and keep up with the times. GG</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">thing is it a laptop what you want is one that is small light that packs a punch in performance. Looking at the alienware laptop it look arfully big and bulky and would be a pain to carry around campus nore one i would be seen using. <br>
<br>
As said before dell does nice xps laptop is very small and got good performance not sure how the dell service is down your end when i got mine have not had any problems with it still good till today but allot of thing can change. I say go for a asus they really making some good laptop that will fit well into daily life. <br>

but that said its personnel preference if you want to carrry a heavy brick with you for a desktop replacement go a ahead.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ive had to fix quite a few of these. Ended up having to part laptops out because of how they build them and how a said part cant be replaced or they arrange it to make the computer fail.<br>
Then again you may have had a lucky time with them, but Ive had to fix quite a few desktops and laptops from DELL. I also think Compaq is shit too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"><a href="http://www.ufos-aliens.co.uk/cosmicapollo.html" class="postlink">http://www.ufos-aliens.co.uk/cosmicapollo.html</a>    It's a conspiracy! I read a few articles on this several years ago, kind of interesting if you're the skeptical type...back then it was all about "American pride' and beating the Russians...we got off to a terrible start after Kennedy's promise of landing on the moon by the end of the 60's. Our first vehicle designed to get there resulted in 3 astronauts dying in a fire on Apollo 1 in a test facility. So a few people think to live up to Kennedy's promise and to justify all the money spent on NASA that we faked it. It <em class="text-italics">is</em> kind of strange to me that with all the vast improvements in technology that we haven't been back in over 30 years, but then again there's nothing there but rocks and dust. I think I read that the Apollo command module's on board computer is equivalent to a modern day cell phone lol. Pretty impressive if they did manage to do that with so little back then. And no I don't get my info on this just from UFO sites, I'm an astronomy nut  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm going to lean towards a no, they did not.  It was a race after all...let communist russia beat us? ha, never.  But I do think it happened shortly there after.  I say we induce Armstrong with some truth serum and find the real can of beans. Unless the government brain washed him, so the real truth never comes out...then its just a waste of time.  <br>
<br>
Now, Im all for space exploration, what Im not sure of is why don't they stop spending billions on pointless missions like gathering samples on planets we know will never be habitable or have no real use to us.  At least for a year, then we could shit those billions into the economy, into assistance programs, etc... at the moment it seems to be a waste. I feel one year of studying pointless rocks on a pointless planet will not set back the scientific study of the universe (in respects to those studies) by 20 years or something....not like we're every really going to do anything productive in space for a long while anyways....maybe in the year 3000 there may be some headway in technology to make space a profitable enterprise. <br>
<br>
There are studies going on that are worth it...I'm just saying cut the stupid ones that wanna-be scientist are doing so they can live off the federal grants and have something to do.  For a little while at least.  It will be interesting seeing Obama bin Ladens, whoops, Im mean Barack Obama's budget plan.  I have no idea on his stand point for the space programs.  All I know his he's trying to turn us into Canada, kind of.  Then we will just have to invade ourselves.  Because we all know Canada will soon be ours. <br>

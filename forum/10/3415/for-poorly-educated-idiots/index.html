	<div class="content">Canada is a vast country of different peoples. There is Quebec and Prince Edward Island (i have 50 or more cousin i have never met there)  filled with French Speaking frog-like faggot ass HABS and the rest of the country.<br>
The normal part of the country is the really big consumer of Labatts and about as useless as a cotton dildo.<br>
They are, despite being wastoid fans of old Dating Game reruns, more Americanoid and, although totally worthless industrially or militarily, not completely useless frog-like leftist Franco-dildoes.<br>
<br>
And do not broach the subject of Acid rain with these twits. They will do their best Lawrence Welk cum TreeHugger imposturization and bore you to death.<br>
<br>
Also. never offer a Canadian a beer. Thats all they do, drink beer and bitch about America. They will drink ALL your beer and whine a lot, and then puke on your Afghan woven Rug.<br>
<br>
So, the folks you should really hate are in Quebec and several small concerns.<br>
The rest of Canada, Americans should just disdain.<br>
Act like you like them so they don't start that hi pitched whiny ass voice of theirs.<br>

<br>
    * You bring a portable TV on a camping trip so that you don't miss Hockey Night.<br>
    * You can repeat the entire Molson's Canadian 'The Rant'.<br>
    * You know all the words to "If I had a million dollars" by The Barenaked Ladies, including the inter-stanza banter between Steven and Ed.<br>
    * You dismiss all beers under 6% as "for children and the elderly."<br>
    * You hum David Foster's '88 Calgary Olympics theme in the shower. <br>
    * You know that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) don't always look like that.<br>

    * You watch MuchMusic constantly, in the hopes of occasional fleeting glimpses of The Tragically Hip. <br>

    * Your backpack has more than one Canadian flag iron-on (and you always have room for more).<br>
    * You know the names of all the guys in Sloan.<br>
    * You have been on Speaker's Corner. Bonus points if they edited out your carefully prepared rant against the Harris government. <br>
    * You know the French equivalents of "free", "prize" and "no sugar added", thanks to your extensive education in bilingual cereal packaging. <br>
    * You still haven't taken down your "NON" posters from the 95 Referendum.<br>
    * You know more than 3 guys named Gordon. <br>
    * You think Ashley MacIssac isn't Celtic enough. <br>

    * You know that a "Premier" isn't a baby born a few months early.<br>
    * You actually watch The Gemini Awards, The Genie Awards, and The Juno Awards. You wonder why Stompin' Tom doesn't get his own category in all three. You scream passionately at the television when your favourite Canadian performers are overlooked by their respective academies. <br>

    * You substitute beer for water when cooking. <br>
    * You carry empty beer cans from your camping trips home with you in your backpack so you can recycle them when you reach civilization. <br>

    * You prefer Elvis Stojko when he has 'hockey hair' - a.k.a. 'the mullet' or 'the shorty-longback'. <br>
    * You brag about the sweet herb in BC.<br>
    * You know the chorus of "The Log Driver's Waltz" and are particularly fond of the 'burling down and down' bit. <br>
    * You steal stationery from your Government of Canada co-operative education placement because you figure you can find lots of uses for paper with 'Human Resources Development Canada/Développement des Ressources Humaines Canada' written at the top.<br>
    * You have daydreams that film-maker Don McKellar, and Hugh Dillon from The Headstones, skinned and ate Regis Philbin.<br>
    * You recognize: CPP, RSP, and CCM. <br>

    * You refuse to consume chocolate that doesn't come in either Smarties, Coffee Crisp, or Laura Secord format.<br>
    * You die a little inside if you can't get your Tim's double-double every morning. <br>
    * You know the difference between real snow and "television" snow -- the white stuff that passes for snow on tv and in films. You scream, "For Christsake! That should be sticking to their pants!" and "Lookit, it's not melting! That's *so* not snow!" when watching 'Winter' scenes.<br>
    * Someone accidently stepped on your foot. You apologize. <br>
    * You stepped on someone's foot. You apologize, then apologize for making them apologize. <br>
    * You know Casey and Finnegan are NOT a Celtic rock band or imported beer. <br>
    * You know who Foster Hewitt is. <br>
    * You can spot MEC from a kilometre away, even if the little white tag is hidden.<br>
    * You're either out to bingo or getting stinko (and you think no more of Inco) on a Sudbury Saturday night.<br>
    * You've actually said, "Stay where yer at, 'till I gets where yer to."<br>
    * You pity people who haven't tasted a "beavertail".<br>
    * Complete the phrase: "The good old ____ game is the best ____ you can ____."<br>
    * You've got some rocks and you've got to leave an important message -- Lucky you know how to build an innukshuk!<br>
    * You have at least one ROOTS sweatshirt that always smells like cigarettes and beer.<br>
    * You find it difficult to explain "milk in a bag" to non-Canadians, and even more difficult to describe the "snippy-thing" used on bag corners. (Bonus points if your collected snippy-things are stuck to your fridge.)<br>
    * You're pretty sure you can see Alex Trebek smirking when Jeopardy contestants get the "Canada questions" wrong. Even if you weren't sure of the answer yourself, you consider yourself a hundred times smarter than the idiots who always guess, "What is .. uh, Toronto?"<br>
    * Your Saturday nights in the Atlantic provinces include eating beans and brown bread as you watch Hockey Night in Canada.<br>
    * You know that the Canadian Alliance is just the Reform Party with better hair.<br>
    * You know that, contrary to general belief, the Inuit have about the same amount of words for snow as do English speakers. Your favourite Inuit word for 'snow' is "navcaq" (snow formation about to collapse).<br>
    * Your local zoo is mainly flamingoes, giraffes and sad elephants freezing their asses off against a backdrop of pine trees, grey skies, and precambrian shield formations.<br>
    * You wonder why squirrels and seagulls somehow manage to get in every zoo exhibit (including the parking lot and squirrel and seagull exhibits).<br>
    * You live in a "beach town" and have to eat your brothers and sisters to stay alive during the winter months.<br>
    * You wonder why Esther Canadas has been blessed with both beauty and the coolest name on the planet -- although Canuck cutie Shalom Harlow could wipe the floor with her.<br>

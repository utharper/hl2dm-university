	<div class="content">So I started a petition and have gotten a lot of support so far to end HL2DM:OB once and for all the mod is shit only thing it has going for it is the fixed bonnyhooping.<br>
<br>
CONS:<br>
- It sounds like shit; the g-gun and xbow sounds are amplified like 500% over all other sounds<br>
- New models are uselessly shitty<br>
- Has a permanent gray box in the bottom center of your screen for some dumb fucking reason. <br>
- The orbs are about the size of The New Guy's balls IRL. <br>
- No one fucking plays it and it doesn't have a 24/7 DM_KILLBOX_KBH_2P LIKE WARFARE ARENA 2<br>
- The New Guy promotes it and has to be the gayest HL2:DM player who has ever lived. <br>
- Ummm that's all so far<br>
<br>
But ya support my cause guys Ive already got written signatures from various people like suspected cheater Phantom, long time dm and pill-popping expert Blastphemy Squad, 1v1 whore and Acapulco gold junkie Bahlk, and 1-hit kill shotgun pro, dirt bike enthusiast, and nickname buff vap0riZeR. <br>

	<div class="content">Why don't we simply open a steam group for fixing that small bit of code in dm thats causing the bhop issue and i could have Valve know about it.<br>
You need to understand Valve is not going to FULLY support the game however we might get just this small bit fixes if they see its triggering enogh interest within the community.<br>
To answer obvious arguments; Save HL2DM and its kind were basically calling for renewed support which will never happen. This is different since the group will only focus on one thing only.<br>

You can't end Hl2dm:OB once and for all, it will continue to exist as James updates it (which Valve doesn't do) and better people will continue to play it.<br>
<br>
Also, four people isn't "a lot of support" despite how good they are, not that Bahlk or Phantom seem to be in support of removing OB anymore, leaving two.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

1) Sounds seem fine to me.<br>
2) Don't use them.<br>
3) I don't even notice the minuscule box since my net_graph 1 is there, and how often do you look down at the very bottom of the screen? Idiot.<br>
4) Orbs are exactly the same--open your eyes.<br>
5) People will be playing it in eFPS, so I guess that counts for something.<br>
6) He's better than you.<br>
<br>
We all know that you're only complaining about OB mod because you can't shoot people who have good movement and you can't bunny hop at all.<br>
And if all those people supported this petition, how come all of them supported OB mod to be used in eFPS over regular DM? I have personally talked to blas, bahlk, phantom, and vaporizer and they are all in favour of OB mod. Maybe you could sign that petition 100 times over and see what happens. Switch up the colour of your pens too, and then fax it to Valve and Fearsome's designated HL2DM fax machine. That will probably work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

1. Will be fixed next release, turn your sound down a tad if it bothers you.<br>
2. New models won't be used.<br>
3. I have no gray box on my screen, never have. You must have copied over some hud from broken dm.<br>
4. Orbs exactly the same.<br>
5. I just happened to put up a 24/7 dm_killbox_kbh2_2p server a few days ago, glad you wanted one.<br>
6. New guy is funny and has done a hell of a lot more than you for hl2dm.<br>
<br>
I personally think people who complain about obmod, only do so because there opponents don't come to a complete standstill every few seconds thus making kills harder to come by.<br>
I'm sure you prefer the sitting duck version that regular dm is because its easy to get stationary kills, but hey regular dm had obmod movement for like 6 years before the update<br>
and most people prefer the "real" movement. I more or less quti playing regular dm because the update broke the very reason I played the game in the first place, the movement.<br>
<br>
And to panic I've played tons of hours of obmod and I have never seen a dropped frame, dunno what you are talking about.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Now we have a guy that is putting in lots of work to fix all the bugs and the like in hl2dm and you cry and mock him?   Guess I did the same in 05 cal when it was a vote to switch to pro.  But at least pro had some game breaking bugs at the time.  Guess what it wasn't a big deal for the entire competitive community to download a mod to play.  And ppro to a lot longer to download.<br>
<br>
Ob has no game breaking bugs atm (if it does let me know)<br>
while hl2dm does have a game breaking bug.  And valve will not fix it anytime soon.  Maybe when they do switch back.  But I don’t see why ppl would want to come back and play a broken version of hl2dm</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The hl2 community seems less reluctant in general to download and install mods for competition, it might be the way they are handled i.e we have to source them amnually then install to a specific folder burried insider other folders whereas Quake/doom/.. basically idtech mods can be downloaded from the game upon jopining the server via fast downloads.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I once thought as you did right after Valve updated dm. Unfortunately, it isnt going to happen. The OB mod is the best route to take as there is a developer on hand to fix things if need be and to improve things for leagues. It has been obvious for YEARS that Valve does not care about hl2dm, otherwise they would actually update it on occasion. The update to OB doesnt count as an update because they wouldnt had done it if not for them moving stuff to Mac. This community has been crying out to Valve forever with zero results.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The at most 500 people who still care about this game/aren't noobs who prefer people to be slower won't grab Valve's attention to tend to a dead game from over five years ago.<br>
<br>
Also Dallas already decided that eFPS would be played in OB and there is therefore no reason to continue arguing about it.<br>

It really doesnt matter though when its a league. League play is a select group of players that will get whatever is needed to play in the league if they wanna play. If you go the mod route and stick to it the outcome will probably be better then going the default route imo. You gotta remember that it makes a big difference when there is a developer handy to fix anything that is needed. Now getting random noobs to download and play a mod for pubbing is a whole different animal. Most people dont even know where to download mods or even that they exist. When HL2:CTF made steam news back in the day (5 yrs ago lol) it gained 500 players because of it. So, some mods can do well under the right situations. Efps is going to run a hl2ctf tourny after we get the thing released, so its not like the OB mod would be the only mod efps would be dealing with <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Efps is going to run a hl2ctf tourny after we get the thing released, so its not like the OB mod would be the only mod efps would be dealing with <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">.</div></blockquote>

In Quake you can create game mods WITHIN the game. In Source however a mod created using the SDK needs to either have an installer or be manually placed into folders.

This is just how Source works.<br>
Valve will not release Source as open code because they fear their games will be heavily hacked and damage the different games communities.<br>
Now on the flipside. ..Ive seen too many cases where community efforts where rewarded and eknowledged by Valve to, much like many here, say: "Valve will never fix the game". Sorry, this is just not how it works. <br>
I swear to god the comp hl2dm community must be the most missinformed group in all Source games. Here's the deal<br>
HL2DM has only just recently begun to be a source of revenue for Valve.<br>
 Obviously they will not just go in and fix game issues <strong class="text-strong">that affect an invisible portion of the community</strong> - end of story!!<br>
BUT!!! If that small group will get together and get BIGGER, recruiting others to the cause: it WILL become extremely large in a short period of time and only then your voices will be heard and updates and fixes concerning YOU will once again become possible.<br>
Those who whine about Valve simply don't know the first thing about this company let alone how business works.<br>
Companies' Support and Response are direct results of CUSTOMERS DEMAND.<br>
<br>
Join the HL2DM Bhop group and help me recruit as many people as possible and i guaranty you it will be a fruitfull effort.</div></blockquote>

The at most 500 people who still care about this game/aren't noobs who prefer people to be slower won't grab Valve's attention to tend to a dead game from over five years ago.<br>
<br>
Also Dallas already decided that eFPS would be played in OB and there is therefore no reason to continue arguing about it.<br>
Summary of this thread: OB has someone tending to it. Hl2dm does not.</div></blockquote>

If you actually read the post you'd realize it's not speaking againt using ob mod in efps. It's taking a far larger pov on things.<br>
<br>
@sac: there was never a united- one voice community in hl2dm to be able to test whether valve responds or not.<br>
And another thing; have't you notice dm is receiving updates again?<br>
The game is not dead - the comp scene is. It's getting a chance for new life now with efps and ppl coming together around it - whether you'll use ob or not - join the group and once enough ppl join we have a chance of getting something done.<br>
Worse case - you've joined a group with a cool icon.<br>
<br>
I for one don't see a broblem with using a mod for league play. Ive pointed out some concerns but im against it. Ive supported efps since its inception mind you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok, I just checked steam news going all the way back to dm being updated to the OB engine. There isnt one single hl2dm specific update. Not one. There have been engine updates, which are not the same thing because they are global. This is an example of that.<br>

Those to me do not count because Valve isnt doing it to help dm, it is for the TF2 and CSS. Also note the order Valve puts their titles in on their updates lol. That is their "order of importance" list. Now, to give you an idea of how much Valve really cares about hl2dm, here was the steam news post for the big HL2dm OB update. Tell me what you think of this.<br>

Every time Valve "fixes" something for HL2DM they break six other things.  Put your effort and support behind the mod.  At least it has someone actively making it better according to what the community wants.  Valve will only fuck the game up more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

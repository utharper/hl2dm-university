	<div class="content">Hi, I'm new to computer upgrades. I want to upgrade my sound card from the onboard AC 97. I'm running Windows XP with a Soltek SL-915GPro-FGR mainboard..PCI Express. System is about 2.5 yrs old now. I have a pair of Zalman 5.1 headphones that I want to put into action on Hl2dm, but have not had much luck with the stock sound setup. I have heard that some sound cards will not work well with Hl2dm...so I don't need any more crashes/clashes. Any ideas would be very helpful...thanks in advance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have owned a number of sound cards, I used to own the Creative X-Fi, while the sound was decent (but not amazing) they were not stable as is usual with creative products and they caused me to lose a trivial yet important 1v1 match after which i was eliminated from FIOS. After that I would have problems that creative has known about for literally years (since this problem existed in audigy) and has been never solved. The headache and time lost dealing with that card has cost me more then I can calculate. Finally I returned it to new egg and was refunded. This problem has happened to other people I know it is not an isolated incedent. <br>
<br>
Much research has produced no real good alternatives. I would try the m-audio and see how that works. I am curious to see how the razer baracuda sound card works out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have the Razer Barracuda sound card and headphones.  I got them when i was running a med quality xp system and I know it sounds crazy but they completely changed how i hear things in-game.  Lots of little sounds like clips being reloaded are clear and loud even when they are at a distance.  I also found myself spending hours listening to music with my eyes closed.  This combo creates real bass (not just vibrating phones) and sounds almost like $500 studio mixing phones.  If you are running xp and can afford it i definately recommend this combo.  <br>
<br>
NOTE - I got the headphones first, but when I plugged them into the Razer card, they sounded 10x better than on the old card.  Razer created these products go work together.<br>
<br>
Now the bad news.  I recently built a retardedly powerful system,  with Vista ultimate 64-bit os.  Razer has not released Vista 64 bit drivers at all, and only has beta Vista 32 bit drivers.  So until razer releases them, I am stuck using onboard audio, which isnt really that bad.  <br>
<br>
If you are on an xp system this is more than worth your $.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

For a couple years I used on board audio, with so-so head phones, and I thought it was OK...then I got an X-Fi card, and suddenly there were so many more sounds to pay attention to, giving me clues to where other players were....<br>

I totally recommend a good sound card/headphone combo.  It just seems to get you that much more than the built in stuff.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is a good deal 60$ for a razer barracuda. I have no idea why it is 1/3rd the price of a regular one I bought one and cannot tell any difference. This is more like the price this card should be. It works so far so if any of you need one this is an option.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I have a cheap Sound Blaster Audigy and it works pretty well.<br>
I have pretty good hearing so I can pretty much hear little details far away.<br>
<br>
If I would upgrade cards at this point I would go beyond a simple PCI sound card. I would go straight ahead and get a sound studio quality card..   <br>
Something a long the lines of this <br>

Not only will I get good Audio quality out of it, it would help me more when I also use this rig to be my sound studio for mixes.<br>
<br>
My holy grail of sound cards would be something like this one.<br>

	<div class="content">Kinda funny this was bumped today, since I decided to resume my search for the right sound card.  But allas I can't find one that does all that I want.  I want a card capable of 7.1 audio, is stable, and has jacks that I can use to hitch up midi devices.  I don't know enough about the connector/jack types to determine whether a certain card would support midi devices or not.  <br>
<br>
You might be able to help me with this crowbar ninja.  I am trying to make a setup that I can use Reason 4.0 (music production software) with a midi input device like a simple 61 key midi keyboard.  That is like that basics of what I want to do other than have great sound while I play music and games.  When I was learning how to use Reason and Protools in highschool I remember an M-Audio adapter box that allowed you to plug in midi inputs and audio chord inputs (like an electric guitar cord) and then plug that into an Emac.  So really I guess I need a card designed for music production but will also flawlessly support my gaming needs.  I dunno I feel like a lost sheep in the world of technical specs, its all fuckin greek when you don't know what to look for.  I hate the supported connector specs, all acronyms that are easily mixed up, at least for someone as ignorant as I. lol  <br>
<br>
I don't wanna buy two cards.  can you run two cards?  I know too little about sound cards *sigh*  I just want to cop out and buy the Razer one lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I, myself, have been trying to get two sound cards running on mine. I'm trying to set up Traktor 3 properly and I have yet to make it work the way I want it to. It seems to me that the card you're looking for has an external box where you hook up all your inputs and outputs. Thats probably your best bet. <br>

Not quite sure if this does what I need. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused">  I really only need something for the time being that I can plug midi keyboards into so I can use that as the input device that manipulates my synths in reason.  I just wanna make some techno!!  so confused lol.<br>
<br>
cool cool thanks man.  yeah I really need to do more research on the peripherals I'm going to need for my music setup so I can educate myself on the cornicopea of connectors out there.  I really hate having to use adapters and such things so I always try to get items that are compatible with one another, more work, better results.<br>
<br>
Ok this is probly gonna be a super noob of a question, but I was checking out the card you suggested, and how would I plug normal computer speakers and headphones into that setup?  Would I have to get something else to plug into the box that would give me those jacks?  The only connector I see coming off the sound card itself is that 15 pin D-sub cable.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"><br>
<br>
Edit:  Ahahah I just went back and looked at that page and found a diagram that I didn't see before that answers all of my questions about this piece of hardware. <a href="http://www.m-audio.com/layout/imgview.php?i=/images/en/connectivity/big/FastTrackPro.jpg" class="postlink">http://www.m-audio.com/layout/imgview.p ... ackPro.jpg</a>  Granted it has limited imputs but I'm pretty sure thats all I'll need unless I start getting more hardware.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah.. I was going to get a midi controller a few weeks ago but the place I ordered it from was giving me crap about my shipping and billing adresses.  <br>
<br>
I believe the connectors for that card go Card to PCI slot&gt; Cable from card to input/output box&gt; Speakers and whatnot to the outputs and midi, guitars and whatnot to the inputs.<br>
<br>
I dont know how the card works myself but it seems like a logical way it would be set up.<br>
<br>
the controller I was going to get was from Numark. I decided I would work a bit more and save up the money to get a laptop and this instead. The controller is included in the package. <br>

	<div class="content">One of the people on my public server discovered an exploit with the two afk scripts I was running.  I have the one where you type !away and !back and also the one where you look at a wall an it protects you from a wall kill.  If someone types !away at the right time while looking at a wall and then comes back to the game they can't be killed.  They are esasy to spot because if you have a message thet tells you how much health your killer has left because they always have something like 999999 health.  If you have a public server that runs both away scripts then you have to disable one to eliminate the exploit.  Otherwise nefarious players will use it to avoid dying.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Personal opinion...do away with the script altogether and make spawn and wall killing legal.<br>
<br>
If that doesn't appeal, there is a plugin somewhere that doesn't use the commands to be activated instead of a script. I cant proly find out what it is, assuming that is not the one you are using already.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Players can use spectate mode to do the same thing- just bail into spec whenever they feel likely to die. Its never a problem on private servers, but if youre running a public server you have 2 choices: Spend a great deal of time adminning a load of stupid children, or disable all the available means for said children to act stupid. Ive seen servers that have taken both paths and i must say, the latter type are alot more enjoyable to frequent.<br>
<br>
Also, most plugins cause lag and poor hit registration at best, frequent crashes at worst, and are generally best avoided.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you have enough protection in default -&gt; 2 nades, a Ggun, SMG, pistol, and melee of your choice<br>

This keeps the server fast and fun Ex: The War Room which was the top 12 man server in many  world rankings, only a few 24 man ctf servers had more players</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

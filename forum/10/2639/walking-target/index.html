This actually gives me an excuse to answer your last post in the thread that WT locked before I could answer  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>okay so you expect me to not spray you after i kill you just because you dont like it? </div></blockquote>

Then stop crying that people dont want to play wit chooo..  Da peeps dont like playing with the asshats that act like dat yo.  We dont care if you get all upset because of it and start 100 more threads here, its not going to make anyone want to play with you any more than they did before your first post.  Sooner or later the threads will fade away and we still wont want to play with you.  <br>
<br>
Stop and think for a second.  Why do you suppose the posts above are calling for you to get banned?  Any of this sinking in yet?  Here is a hint:  You are slowly being shunned by the community, do you even care?  Hello...any intelligent life in there?

i still agree he can spray who ever he wants / as many times as his little heart desires. It was a function put into the game to be used, unlike teabaging which is a deliberate act that implies something inappropriate.<br>

I am pretty sure that unsportsmanlike conduct of any kind is not tolerated in any sports league.  You are saying we should tolerate it here?  I disagree.  Spraying on or around an opponent after killing them is unsportsmanlike conduct and it is meant as a insult. There is no other way to interpret that action. <br>
<br>
 Keep in mind that we are trying to encourage new people to get into the league.  This kind of behavior is counterproductive to that endeavor.  I know good people who absolutely will not play in CAL because of the reputation that CAL players are a bunch of assholes.  Is that the kind of reputation we want to have prevail for this league?

While I am not a Slick Fro groupie and have no love of his cluttering up the Cafeteria with inane posts I don't actually agree with this.  It seem to me the interpretation is open to each individual.<br>
<br>
I have always viewed spraying as a form of head games much like calling a time out right before a crucial field goal or free throw shot.  I have never taken it as an insult.  More it is just a way to try to force your opponent into a future mistake because you are now "in their head".<br>

That is also open to interpretation.  It is common place in most basketball games I have played and again it is just a way to get into someone's head.  I am sure that it bothers some people but in general it seems widely accepted, or at least widely ignored, across most sports.  I can guarantee you when a defensive end comes crashing into the quarterback, gets up, and points down at the quarterback he is not saying "I think you will make that pass next time."  More than likely it sounds like "More of that coming, best just stay down bitch."  You never see a ref throw his flag over this.  If the hit is late, sure.  But not for the taunt, never.<br>
<br>
Do you not talk trash in Hockey?<br>

How did you take Nivek saying "fuck u" every time he killed you yesterday?  Did he also spray you?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is also open to interpretation.  It is common place in most basketball games I have played and again it is just a way to get into someone's head.  I am sure that it bothers some people but in general it seems widely accepted, or at least widely ignored, across most sports.  I can guarantee you when a defensive end comes crashing into the quarterback, gets up, and points down at the quarterback he is not saying "I think you will make that pass next time."  More than likely it sounds like "More of that coming, best just stay down bitch."  You never see a ref throw his flag over this.  If the hit is late, sure.  But not for the taunt, never.<br>
<br>
Do you not talk trash in Hockey?<br>
<br>
How did you take Nivek saying "fuck u" every time he killed you yesterday?  Did he also spray you?</div></blockquote>

We do trash talk. I don't do it much though because I am not too quick with words. I let my actions do my talking. I take down their number and teach them how bright the lights on the ceiling are.<br>
<br>
Nivek and I have played together for over 2 years or so. I never get pissed over this. I just do it back. He did spray me too. I think it's different though when one of your friends do it or when a complete stranger does it. It's like when you're hanging out with a buddy. If he said some type of comment that was a complete ownage with words. You'd both laugh and keep hanging out, but if someone you didn't know came up and said the exact same thing you'd get pissed. I think it would be completely different if nivek sprayed me vs. someone else I didn't like spraying me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

QFT<br>
<br>
I think the DE/QB analogy is better than the chess analogy.  Just like the hard hit followed by the taunt can force the QB's attention away from making good passes (instead they worry over where the next hit will come from), the kill followed by the spray often makes players rush to seek revenge taking them out of their game.<br>
<br>
I never spray, but I understand why people do and I just decided a long time ago that it wouldn't bother me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Spraying is distracting, and when you have players running around spraying up the place it is making it so you can't hear certain things like items respawn and other sound cues. So by allowing players to distract with sprays would be no different than letting them spam mic with sound, or chat with worthless text, it is not needed.<br>

We all know that is it annoying and rude and he is a douche for doing so. but after looking, and im actually suprized to find, only 1 division in cal has a rule of this sort. DOD-S<br>
<br>
2.80a Spraying<br>
        The use of your spray to 'taunt' your opponent is considered illegal, If its found that you are spraying your dead opponents to be unsportsmanlike it could result in a suspension of the violating players, The suspension length will be the same as unsportsmanlike conduct. There will be some leeway in this rule as it will be up to the admin to decide if the offending player was doing it to be unsportsmanlike or not.<br>
<br>
after seeing this i guess i would not be apposed to seeing this rule put in place, since i really doubted that it would be illegal to spray in any league ( most just dont allow custom sprays with racism or inappropriate stuff) . My initial thought on the subject is there is a big difference between spraying someone (in game function) and teabagging (deliberately dry humping a dead corpse's head implying to be getting sex of some  sort) which is obv not appropriate and obv not meant by the original game designers which is why your post was silly.<br>
<br>
and another reason it concerns me to start implimenting rules of the sort is also if ppl spray someone ( as keeper said ) what if it was a perfectly acceptable time to spray, it was a nice fucking shot, or they tried to crowbar you and your 180 hs there face, perfect time to spray. What if the person (loosing or not) getting sprayed bitches and moans and doesnt like the other person, so then it turns into a whole ordeal with suspending the player, reviewing demos, listening to them cry some more. And IMO unfortunatly the cal admins are kind of seen by many as WILD RUTHLESS DICTATORES WITH AN AGENDA so the less we would have to deal with loosers bitching and crying then bitching and crying at cal ALL BECUASE of a spray would be better eh.<br>
<br>
and also imo, spraying and unsportsmanlike conduct is the least of the reasons this league is so small. It simply because teams dont like getting horrible ass raped beyond belief. They come in and try it ( and I OF ALL PPL ME!, many many times have made many players leave mid match in 1v1 / team play and drop out of cal simply becuase i was owning them to hard, my point being is, if ppl are leaving because someone like ME put a beat down on them, why would they even bother playing.

I have had this happen twice... people leave mid game because they don't like the beating I am giving them.  They both left the league afterward and one even managed to leave before I could report the "win" so I ended up reporting a forfeit win.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

Without it people could use bright skins or replace the wall textures with a glass textures or replace ambient sounds with blanks and make useful sounds louder.

Both these rules should be implemented. Im amazed they are not already. There should never be any chatting or spraying during a league match of anykind and I wish it was disabled completely during said matches. Its just not needed. I forget who it was, but in our first CAL 4 vs 4 match last season, he had a chat bind on for everytime he got a kill or died. It was the most annoying thing Id ever seen and he should of been suspended for it imo.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

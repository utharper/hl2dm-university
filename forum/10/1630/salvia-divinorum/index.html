	<div class="content">Sooooo me and blas were just chatting, sharing some good old drug memories and such and we brought up Salvia.<br>
<br>
Now i was a big stoner in high school like 5 grams a day ( not of that Mexican brick weed shit ) but a friend was telling me about Salvia, and was like ya man its legal and it makes u hallucinate and trip out man! and told me his story, i was like ?? its legal?? and makes u trip out? ya ok.. sure...w.e u say ( since he was a stoner newbie  he didnt have much credibility lol...) ne ways couple weeks later i got some.<br>
<br>
<br>
So i packed a massive bowl in my 3 footer, ( its all shake so it burnt really fast ) and smoke it all in one hit, while i was holding it in packing up another 1 i blacked out. I remeber like... kicking the wall in front of me trying to slam on the breaks cause i thought i fell asleep while driving. Then i actually woke up, and was listening to music on media player, u know the wierd  color thingy thats all like whoa and trickling down the screen, when i turned away the trickling or w.e followed and took over my whole room, and how i perceived it or w.e was like.. i was getting pulled away from existence (everyone i know who has done it has had this same strange pulling sensation) So i think im getting sucked out of existence or something, and then i stand up and see my self in the mirror, i distinctively remember thinking to my self  like.. (WTF!?!??!? YOUR NOT ME!??! WTF!?? !WTF!?!?!?!) so i rip off my cloths and run up stairs trying to escape not being sucked away, and i see my family, and im thinking to my self there not really them!, but there the only ppl i can trust! so i try to like... get to them and not be sucked away while still freaking out and then i start comming back to reality, and snap out of it, and my bro my mom and aunt are all sitting watching tv and looking at me like .......................................................................................<br>

	<div class="content">Oh man. I'm at a service academy so I can't usually experiment with <span style="text-decoration:underline">anything</span> from the fear of getting kicked out, not even alcohol. I wish so bad that I was joking  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> So as you can imagine when me and my roomie found out about this shit, we bought one of the little purple packets aforementioned, and smoked it in a pipe. This probably wasn't a good idea considering that there are at least a hundred people here with hookas, but we didn't want to wait. We paid for out foolishness with some pretty hot smoke. Make that shit was painful to inhale  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"> I looked at my roomie and was like "are you getting anything?", and he was like "no". <br>
<br>
It took about 5 minutes to kick in and it lasted for about half an hour. It started with things appearing super three dimensional, for example the books on my shelf were all popping out at me and stuff. We turned the lights off and more trippy shit happened. For example when I looked at myself in the mirror it was all super surreal, like what I was looking at was a completely different person. And then I was looking at my roomies face and it kept disappearing, so that he was just a silhouette. And then later on he turned into a painting somehow, like his face looking like the Mona Lisa. <br>
<br>
I kinda want to try it again just because my experience was tainted by the pain of burning smoke from a pipe.<br>

	<div class="content">I've never tried it, but I read quite a bit about it a couple years ago. It was originally used by shamans in southern Mexico.  If you chew it, the trip is longer and less intense than smoking it  The smoking trip is so intense that it can be unpleasant.  It is not addictive.  You need a spotter when you take it because you can lose touch with reality completely and potentially hurt yourself.  Many of the accounts of trips are fascinating and people sometimes describe them as life changing.  It is not something you do for a buzz/rush.  It's more like a spiritual quest that can make you question the nature of reality and human consciousness.  You can read some trip reports here:<br>

(my main motivation for ever trying drugs)  But my advice is if you wanna trip eat some shrooms a couple of times to ease into the trippin experience, then try some acid and hold on to your sanity, cause its gonna be a bumpy ride.(by bumpy i mean VERY disorienting you really gotta be ready for your first time unless you really like trippin like me, then you'll just have the time of your life)  Mmmm Acid how I love thee, my guide to a Technicolor dream world inspired by Salvador Dahli himself!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thank you Coke!  Very well put, I like that you broke the concept of reality into three parts, it makes the nuances far easier to grasp and understand.  I feel like some of my most profound and mind opening insights have occurred during experiences on mushrooms and acid.  These insights are what caused my to seek out books such as Siddhartha which really opened my mind more than any book Ive ever read.  It is described on wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_%28novel%29" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)</a>  Heres a quote from the wiki that really sums up what I got from the book, <blockquote><div><cite>Wikipedia regarding Siddhartha wrote:</cite>"The novel also shows how the path to enlightenment cannot be conferred to another person because it is different for everyone and will likely never be achieved simply by listening to or obeying an enlightened one. For words and teachings may describe the truth but are not the Truth itself; being concepts, they trap you, since enlightenment means release from concepts."</div></blockquote>(I get a little ambiguous here)  This concept in the book has lead me to these conclusions; that understanding is cultivated and nurtured by experience, and that the broader your realm of experience the broader your realm of understanding.  Truth and understanding go hand in hand, for "real" understanding could be of nothing other than the truth...defining what is truth is where everything is complicated to a seemingly infinite degree.  (kinda turns into a train of thought here)  So should I then be compelled to experience all things?  My answer to this is, within reason and purpose, "what do I see myself getting out of this experience and at what cost?"  But then a line of thinking such as that would only serve to limit your experiences...limiting your understanding, which to me doesn't seem right, right?  So then I always find myself integrating ideas of "quality vs quantity" into my thinking with more of an emphasis on reflection, introspection, and attention or awareness of the moment.  I can totally see why some people just lose their minds, when you really open your mind up to the idea of perceiving reality and how in its raw form its completely subjective, like when your a baby with no paradigms to hinder thought.   How do I know that the guys who made numbers popular actually got it right?  What if they fucked up and 3 is really 5 and 7 is 2 and 9 is 10........riiiiight Ian whatever you say mmmaannnn.  As Coke said "Question the Answers."<br>
<br>
Trippin on <em class="text-italics">anything</em> is not to be taken lightly, you ARE changing the way your brain processes information which in turn changes the way you perceive reality, think about that for a while and tell me that doesn't sound like it has the potential to create dangerous situations.  People who do these drugs without propper respect are the ones who get hurt, or hurt other people, please don't be one of those people.  Hallucinogens also effect people in VERY different ways not to mention that the same dose for one person which results in a great trip could also induce a much more intense experience in another person.  Please if you don't know, do your research I can't emphasize that enough, I really can't, knowledge about what your taking can save yours and your friends life.  Things that are essential for novice trippers, people you trust and love, a safe setting where "non-trippers" will not intrude, lots of water, lots of food, extra clothing, toys/fun things, cellphone (off),  all people must be in a good mindset (not depressed, thinking about family problems, basically having too much on your mind is bad), set aside at least 16-24hrs for a trip, DO NOT DRIVE, use your common sense.  And one last piece of advice that has really saved me in the past during intense boundary pushing experiences.  If you start to get scared or things start to get to intense just keep reminding yourself "I am on a drug, I have taken a drug and it is currently in my brain, I am on a drug."  That has always had a grounding effect for me.  <br>
<br>
I don't say these things in para two to try and encourage drugs use, its because knowledge about this shit will save you life if you choose to  experiment.  Drugs can be, and are very dangerous and being smart about using them is the only way to reduce the risk.  One of the best things one can do is to REALLY understand dosages, you MUST know how much of anything you are taking.  I have plenty of friends who have had bad experiences and myself have had only one because I always do my research and am very careful.  Again please be careful any of you out there who like to experiment, it can be great, but it can also be death.  Don't be a statistic.  <br>

	<div class="content">lol.. second part of that post remindes me that time, in the middle of winter, with those shrooms ( "dont eat more than a 20 sack of these") and me epoch and 2 other friends hiked way the fuck out into the woods and ate the whole 1/8 (3.5 grams) which in allmost any case is a hard trip, but with great shrooms, as later showed, can be bad :X<br>
<br>
Ya 3 of us were fine, the 3rd lost his fucking mind, killed our highs, and we then became conserned for his life... so he wouldnt go run away again and crawl into another hole in the snow. Needless to say we basically dragged him home, and allmost got lost..<br>
<br>
but once we  got back in our room... the tunes of that song... ? i cant rember it... its in the ice age sound track " UMBAWAYYY!!! UMBAWAYYY!" hahahaha brought him back, as he sang it to him self still in a slightly delusional state hahahaha<br>
<br>
im glad to say i have never had a freak out trip out of all my experiences. I have allways found my self to be able to control my thoughts, as ian said, remind your self  you are on a drug. like that 1 time we went winter camping and tripped out at marcys cabin.... as i watched my drinking water freeze before my eyes i thought.. this might not have been the greatest idea ahhahahahah and refrained my self from freaking out hahahaha but ya.....<br>

	<div class="content">The site (hl2dm.pro) that held them after dmu went down has recently expired.<br>
I beg of you, guys, for any issues just call out, ask the community for help, I for one am always willing to donate.<br>
<br>
Now idk where Fenix got them (if you do, please let me know) but LanSlide, the other guy that ran that site with him, said it takes 25$ to renew that domain that also had some other pages and a forum that were kinda dead. Therefore I see no point in doing that. I do see a point in tracking down the tutorials as I think they're still helpful and either making a proper steam guide out of them, or re-hosting all the original pages either here, or on the efps site, or on the new hl2dm.net or even I have a site.<br>
<br>
So please, don't let these disappear as they're still useful.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ohhh you are referring to the last part, hehe. I am afraid I am too busy to invest more time into it, although I do regret not completing my courses on frag videos and server administration best practises. At one time, I had accumulated a lot of good info on both subjects from various members of the community and had it all planned out in my head what I was going to write.<br>
<br>
Imagine if Valve had kept working on DM the way they did TF2... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Alright, my first edit is about the controversial shotgun max damage! <a href="http://hl2dmu.com/hl2dm_101.htm" class="postlink">http://hl2dmu.com/hl2dm_101.htm</a><br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The shotgun, although a hitscan weapon (a weapon that fires bullets; in this case, pellets), does not entirely follow the hitscan damage formula, according to this: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/sp/src/game/shared/baseentity_shared.cpp" class="postlink">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source ... shared.cpp</a><br>
Inside this 'for' loop, found at line 1698 (on 18feb2014):<br>
for (int iShot = 0; iShot &lt; info.m_iShots; iShot++)<br>
that iterates through all the bullets fired, from 0 to either 6 or 11 (for the shotgun's 7 pellets for single barrel or 12 pellets for double barrel), there's also this condition at line 1729:<br>
if( IsPlayer() &amp;&amp; info.m_iShots &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; iShot % 2 )<br>
that checks if bullet is not singular, aka if shotgun was fired, and if the current bullet number is odd, it applies a hull trace; if even, then a line trace is applied.<br>
The difference is the hull trace ignores hitboxes (arm, chest, leg, stomach, head), better yet, doesn't differentiate between them, treating the body as a whole, for increased accuracy. Therefore the headshot multiplier of 3 is disregarded, making that bullet do normal damage even if inflicted to the head hitbox.<br>
<br>
This leaves the known body damage unchanged, 9 - 63 for single (player left with 37/0 from 100/0; 9 - 108 for double (player left with 78/114 from 100/200), but changes the maximum damage for the head.<br>
The single barrel will have the pellets split like this: 0, 2, 4, 6 will do head damage (4 x 27 = 108); 1, 3, 5 will do normal body damage (3 x 9 = 27); the new total will be 135 (player left with 73/92 from 100/200).<br>
The double barrel will have 6 pellets do head damage, 162; 6 pellets do body damage, 54; total damage inflicted will be 216 (player left with 57/28 from 100/200). Why is damage taken only 215? The formula for the damage absorption helps: 80% or 172.8 done to suit, 20% or 43.2 done to health. This leaves the player with 28.2 suit left, rounded down to 28, and 56.8 health left, rounded up to 57.</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Oh the fun. <br>
<br>
I still cannot edit my contact info to use any of my real emails because of a "error: newguy" condition that WT made waaaaaaay back in the day.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Ade sux and poor_billy did at least 252 dmg in one shotgun blast in a match vs me; so idk if 324 is doable, but 252 sure is.<br>
Do I have a demo? No. Am I making this up? Probably. Fact is :: Fuck you. Am newguy</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

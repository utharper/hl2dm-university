	<div class="content">Thats true, see the thing about jiujitsu is well, if you cant get the guy on the ground, ur somewhat fucked. (Especially if you dont have a good stand up)<br>
<br>
even worse is when the guy knows ur a ground fighter, then he would know to resist. <br>
<br>
And it requires alot of space, so for example if you get jumped on the bus or something, there wont be much u can do unless your willing to do a flying armbar and land really badly.<br>
<br>
Also, it will be really difficult submitting a guy when hes got 4 other of his friends punching you.<br>
<br>
So all in all, it is the most effective given the right situations.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
like.. i took bjj for about 6 months and after a month i could take my brother on the ground who was 189 state champ in wrestling<br>
<br>
but i have no clue if i could take a punch? how would bjj would actually work in a street fight? like u said there friends would easily drop a boot in there ya know LOL<br>
<br>
like my first instict i would imagine would be to take the guy to the ground cuase i wrestled in school for years and mount and beat, or if i end up underneath with a guy who has no idea about bjj it would be so easy to throw up a triangle loop the leg and drop elbows till he bleeds, or just grab an armbar while hes trying to punch u like an idiot but then what?? do u actually break the guys arm??

	<div class="content">I guess we all just do what our morality thinks is right. Iam sure if we were in that position and we have some sort of lock on the opponent, we would not be giving a fuck if he dislocates something, cause hes probably gonna look for another opportunity to strike asap.<br>
<br>
And if i ever see the potential of getting in a fight with more than 1 person, i will run the fuck away....No way you can take more than one "decent" guy. This is real life, not some jackie chan movie. Plus, wtf are u gonna do if they pull out a knife, which is so damn common these days. I aint taken those risks. Plus, we learn martial arts so we dont need to use it.<br>
<br>
Jiujitsu requires alot of patience to pull of correctly. <br>

	<div class="content">Meh. UFC is getting washed up. I still enjoy it, but they seem to be playing favorites.<br>
I was heavily disseminated with the decision with the title fight with Forrest Griffin and Rampage Jackson.<br>
You know they were playing favorites there. It was totally Jacksons fight because he had more hits obviously, and Im not the only one with this opinion.<br>
<br>
Affliction fighting looks pretty good.<br>
I'm glad Andre Arlovski is fighting again.<br>
<br>
I think Randy  is gonna be in the Affliction fighting, UFC is just holding him back because of the belt.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Although rampage had some good shots, griffin ultimately had a much better ground game, and pretty much evened out the stand up situations with his low kicks which totally got jackson really outta balance.<br>

Nobody trains a single style anymore, those days are long over. Almost every MMA fighter you see these days has Muay Thai training. The leg kicks and checks, all of the knees, clinch work/pummel/head control, standing elbow techniques all derive from it.<br>
<br>
Regarding submissions and street fighting (and don't get me wrong I love bjj and I realize it's value), pure submissions are a backup tool. To ensure your true safety you should remain mobile at all times, try to secure some form of weapon, and if you do take someone down make sure they land hard on something solid like cement, then get back up and kick the shit out of them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

By the same token us wireless people have really <span style="color:#804000">shitty </span>hit registration.<br>

<br>
one thing that did help a little was to change the ssid broadcast channel.<br>
for my belkin type 192.168.1.2 into the browser. <br>
enter your admin pw and change the channel.<br>
the 2.4 ghz channel in apt living is a busy specturm with all the wireless devices. i think 9 is default. saw a few less drops when switching to channel 2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Generally, on wireless ...if your warping, even though it may take your enemy a bit longer to kill u, u are far more disadvantaged, generally your aim and movement are going to be warped, so much so that its impossible to hit, not to mention hit reg with that kind of lag.<br>
Pretty much, wat haapens, is u end up getting a phys object in the face cause your enemy cant be fucked so they take the easy way out, grav gun in the face on wireless connection = totally screwed with no chance espesh if your laging badly. And then theres the fact that everything is delayed, so catchiong nades and using the grav gun in general is absolutly fucked, b4 wen i had a decentish connection about 1/4 to 1/3 of my kills were from grav, just because its so convenient in ffa, not on wireless, i miss out on atleast 20 kills per game just not being able to grav alone. (delay is never consistant, does not compare to play on foreign servers, which i have done)<br>
So in the end, you end up being just another easy/free kill.<br>
Also hate how it drops out constantly, and then there are weeks at a time where i cant even refresh the server list or join games, and if i can i get 900 ping and cant even move out of spawn point.<br>
Advantage, lordy no, its completly unreliable, irritatingly, i doubt that anyone would get any advantage from using wireless.<br>
There may be the occasional lucky situation but meh, thats not generally fun for me either, i'd rather have things work properly then be lag fucked all the time.<br>
<br>
Also, would like to clear something up about lag, most ppl seem to think that lagers have some around the corner advantage, but in reality u are behind in time.<br>
To explain, lets say u come around the corner and quikly but not even necesarily very quikly shoot me in the face, im dead b4 i even see u, now, lets say u miss and just b4 u go bak round the corner, i shoot u in the face, on your screen u will clearly be behind a wall wen u die, but that extra time spent behind the wall would not have given u a chance anyways, unlike with the lager.<br>
<br>
There's my little rant about wireless lag for today, and there are plenty of wierd arse wireless anomalies not even mentioned.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ping spikes during wireless gaming can be sorted by turning off the Wireless Zero Configuration service. Put this in a text file:<br>
<br>
net stop wzcsvc<br>
<br>
and rename it stopwzc.bat. Run that and it will stop the sertvice regularly polling your wireless card (which causes the ping spikes). If you need to restart the service make another file and change stop to start. Or you can just run it from the run option in your start menu. Not a total solution, but makes Wifi gaming a better experience.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

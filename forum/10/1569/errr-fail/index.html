I could go on ... The trend towards TV to movie in most cases is epic fail (The Avengers).  Good luck with the A-Team <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

I would think there is so much new talent out there somebody could come up with new ideas.  I guess that's why indy movies are so popular now a days.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Source: The Hollywood Reporter<br>
May 20, 2008<br>
<br>
<br>
Summit Entertainment is bringing back to the big screen the 1986 sci-fi cult hit Highlander, with Iron Man co-writers Art Marcum and Matt Holloway on board to pen the redo, says The Hollywood Reporter.<br>
<br>
The Russell Mulcahy-directed original starred Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery and Clancy Brown as immortal beings. Lambert played Scottish swordsman Connor MacLeod, Connery an Egyptian and Clancy a barbarian known as the Kurgan. The movie spawned four sequels and three television series.<br>
<br>
Summit acquired the rights to remake the cult classic from Davis/Panzer Productions. Peter Davis, one of the original producers of the 1986 film, will also produce the new version of the film.</div></blockquote>

I realize the sequels to the original were crap, but that's no reason to go back and redo this classic.  Also being remade ... Red Dawn and Robocop?!?!?!?<br>

Now i have another book to add to my "to read" list, I allways have the tendency to read the book after I have seen a movie. I liked the movie, but like all will smith movies, it's just a little over the top (you got to love hollywood  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> ). Ending was great, i love movies with a not so happy ending. Went to see it with my girlfriend, she was actually scaring me half the time, yanking my arm when something scary happened  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
Overall good movie, it wasn't a waste of my time.<br>

<br>
evil dead's remake is a new director, and an all new cast, and ash williams will not be a character, because no one but bruce campbell has the balls to fill that role.<br>
<br>
sam and bruce are doing an evil dead 4 tho.<br>
<br>
at the same time i hate reboots and remakes, the new dawn of the dead was far better than the original, and i loved rob zombie's take on halloween, the new batman was pretty badass, and the next one looks even better. <br>
<br>
At this point in time, everything is going to be a remake of something, or taking ideas from something else, cinema and theater have been around for so long theres no such thing as an original movie these days.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

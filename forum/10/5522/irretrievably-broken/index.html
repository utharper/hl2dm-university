	<div class="content">best describes my view of the current hl2dm update.  a divorce is in order.  much like alcohol enhances a persons "personality", be that good and/or bad.  the "update" has enhanced hl2dm's shortcomings far more than its benefits... imho.  besides, ive lost all tolerance for the script kiddies and hackers.  which seem to be abundant.<br>
<br>
i like sub-zeros mod.  i really do.  but its the same 5 people.  all the time.  there will be no migration.  doesn't matter why.  thats just how its going to be.<br>
<br>
so, like any divorce... its time to move on.  which requires some changes.  and also like any divorce, its time for me to lean on my friends for support.<br>
<br>
im looking for new game ideas... NON VALVE!  i prefer multiplayer gaming against other humans rather than A/I opponents.  and i prefer first person shooters.  im not sure im a fan of coop style, but im open to the idea.  also, if a game is available through steam, even though developed by someone other than valve... does valve still profit from that?  to me, thats a bit like paying alimony.  i'd prefer not to.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

same I was thinking about. ATM it's the only one in my view which can be far not so l33t as HL2DM, but at least closer than the rest. You can see some fast moves there, and even a nade thrower &lt;3<br>

	<div class="content">i havent been this excited for a game in a long time, maybe ever, as i am for brink.  <br>
<br>
CD, i would suggest either MW1 or WaW.  i like playing WaW, i found a server that plays the WaW type maps with modern weapons.  its always full and there really is no hackers.  seems nobody is still bothering to hack that game so you get a nice server of players that are geniune(sp?)  if you like you can still play the normal game with the old WWII weapons, which is a blast too.  <br>
<br>
as with anybody i will always suggest borderlands.  not really MP except for coop, which you werent sure if you liked or not.  since steam started tracking total hours played i have 250 hours in that game, and i bet i had atleast 200 hours b4 they started tracking.  only 2 games have kept my attention like borderlands, those being hl2dm, and UT2004.  <br>
<br>
you seem to be a person that likes game with a great deal of speed(most hl2dm leets do) have you tried any of the quakes?  i think those would be right up your alley.  i personally like quake 4, but quake live is free and you wont have problems finding games.<br>
<br>
other than that, i would suggest BFBC2</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">BFBC2 is a good game.  I would recommend that.  Ive enjoyed many hours playing it.  Its kind of slowing down at the moment but its still a great game.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking about Call of Duty, would strongly suggest the Call of Duty Black Ops over COD Modern Warfare and World at War.  COD4 (MW) will most likely die when BO comes out.  It has been declining rapidly over the last few months.  WAW has been declining for a while as well.  Neither of them are a good investment at this time, IMO.   Many COD MW and WAW people will be moving to BO.  Also, I would not advise you to purchase MW2 because of the dedicated server thing and the lack of admin control over games.<br>
<br>
Quake 4 is pretty dead now.  Quake live might be something you would like since I know you have played and enjoy killboxes.<br>
  <br>
I dont think youll like Borderlands because you arent a single player guy and coop (as you have said) really isnt what you are into either.  <br>
<br>
If you get COD or BFBC2 and think you would like to get into the competative arena for those, hit me up, I have a group I just joined that I think you would like alot.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
honestly, if you go to this website and watch the dev. diaries you will see why this game is going to be the next really big thing in MP gaming.  you have the BL cell shaded art style and then you have the CODish RL art style, Brink brought those together and it looks breath taking.  gameplay looks as smooth as can be, all the customization will be great.  cant wait for this one.<br>
<br>
<br>
also, ive had my eye on this one too. i signed up for the closed beta.  i doubt i would buy it, but its gonna be free to play so might be worth checking out<br>

Yeah I already per-ordered brink in high hopes for it being a game that actually has semi decent movement and possibly good mechanics.  Borderlands is fun and hilarious with only light innuendo + you have a lot friends that already played the hell out of it so if you hit a hard boss/enemy you can hit us up for either good drops or for someone to come in and clean house for ya.  I like the art and play style of the Firefall game there but um SC2 title mimicry much?  <br>
<br>
   Another free game thats also in a closed beta but looks kinda promising is Genesis AD <a href="http://genesis.ijji.com/" class="postlink">http://genesis.ijji.com/</a> movement style is similar to Fortress Forever it looks like, with a couple of similar gameplay mechanics but better style and weaponry with cooler death scenes better effects not dependent on the style of cp,or ctf<br>
<br>
1 game that makes quake look slow but is sadly dead is warsow <a href="http://www.warsow.net" class="postlink">www.warsow.net</a> its fast as hell on the ca style gameplay with wall and rocket jumping your reaching speeds equivalent that of ag2 but more fluid and often faster, and the movement mechanics are pretty simple to get used to<br>
<br>
popular though would be Quake Live though the movement is kinda dorked compared to warsow but your gonna find more people on there easily<br>
<br>
so I suggest Warsow,Brink, and Borderlands in the end.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes there is loads of customisation alot of which can be changed when ingame through the options menu, there are preset configs for "ultra" "high performance" and "competition" hi visibility graphics can also turn off smoke trails for rox grenades and nail gunin the settings, you have to be ingame though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here is an interesting suggestion. I had a similar issue in the early days of HL2DM to me it was broken back then too. So I left and there was nothing to play so I just started hitting up all the old games that were famous I had not played. I tried to understand what it was that the players were so hooked on in those games and learn what the good attributes and bad are. I started in half-life so I never played the quake games or unreals etc. Went back and tried to get good at them all and it made me a much better player. Then that stupid fios tournament came around and stupid helk convinced me to play this again. <br>
<br>
On the other hand it made me a much more jaded player because then more then ever I realized how much garbage is turned out in games today. It never seems to get better. Each game is slower then the last. Things just seem to be getting worse.<br>

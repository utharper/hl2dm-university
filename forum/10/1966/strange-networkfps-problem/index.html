	<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Wondering if anyone can help me out here.  I have a weird FPS problem while playing on some servers.  For some reason, about every 3 seconds, my FPS suddenly drops to less than 20 fps then sores back up to 100 fps.  You can imagine how this affects game play.  At first I thought that it was just the map, but then I stood still and looked in the same direction for several seconds and it still happend.  I then play the same map on a different server and it's just fine.  I suppose the simple answer is "Dont play on that server" , but if its where I have friends playing, then its where I want to play.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions??<br>
<br>
UPDATE<br>
Something I didn't put in this post earlier was that all the other players on the server were NOT having problems. It was just ME.  So I don't think that it was coming from the server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i think you pretty much answered your own question.<br>
the more a server has mani/plug in's running the more loss of fps you're bound to see<br>

	<div class="content">unfortunately if you have isolated the problem to the server it is unlikely there is anything you can do to stop it. Try turning off any setting that would allow the plugin to do anyhing to you or send any messages or sounds or whatever to you if possible. It could also be the server is running on some guys personal computer and he keeps checking his email or looking at another web page. Try playing at the WRW server or some better place.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I do use net_graph 3, and when on the server that Im having problems with, the choke spikes, then drops, spikes, then drops. UP and DOWN.  I'm thinking that maybe with all the flooding in Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois, my connection to that server is getting routed through a real busy area.  Does that sound like a possible reason? <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

"The network has been approved for recreational use, unlike the locked down standard .Mil configuration we will see on active duty. This is why YouTube, and World of warcraft are unblocked, however this is just the beginning.  While because of technical reasons not all games will be unblocked, some still can be. There are currently a few things that are going through the proper channels and I would like to get more suggestions as to the games that we want to play on our network. <br>
<br>
Any game where your computer would need to connect to another players computer will not be approved because the risk is too much. There needs to be a dedicated server. An example of a game that can't be unblocked is counter-strike and to the best of my knowledge steam  will find another player's server for you, not actually host the game its self. If the game has a dedicated host server, like world of warcraft, then it has the potential to be unblocked."<br>
<br>
If any of you know a way that they can filter out non-dedicated servers, I might be able to argue something.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well, if that was possible, couldn't I just ask for the IP to my favorite server to be unblocked? But still, it all comes down to <strong class="text-strong">Im pretty sure that a network admin could allow and dis allow ip's and ranges.</strong></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

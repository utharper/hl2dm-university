Now the top 5 of each division are going to into the semi final, scores are cumulative after THIS point and while yes that is how the standings are coming in that panic posted, after the next round we will have the TOP 3 players with the finals being the weekend after, which will be the 1v1 between #1 and #2.<br>
<br>
We may want to do the top 5 from each division? whatcha think stretch it out a bit, maybe have an underdog rise up... one can hope.. someone get Voz drunk... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>
<br>
Ok clearly this has been kind of a test run, we have had great fun and lots of participation TY ALL!! For the next season which I hope will be in January we will have a website, and everything running much smoother.</span></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">True, however I am considering putting one in the KF server for the next season in January, so we will still have west and east coast servers both with TV <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> BWS has a couple of servers Cheese and yes u were in one <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
Remember, we were kind of testing the waters, looks like there IS interest, people enjoyed it we just need to fine tune [We may want to have an ELITE division for the hard core players <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> ] The interest was definitely generated and now we can go back look at what work and what didn't, making some changes. Adding some people to help will be important we all did our best but we have limitations, Panic held together the score situation, NUTZ was very busy but is managing, I was sick as usual but I keep going but help and ideas are always welcome  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
THANKS to EVERYONE who has helped and participated, especially NUTZ and PANIC!!!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cheer.gif" width="55" height="43" alt=":cheer:" title="Cheer"></div>

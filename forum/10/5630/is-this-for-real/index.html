What the hell are you talking about, political. Maybe you should look up the definition.<br>
<br>
They don't prosecute, so it's okay.<br>
That is like saying anything you get past or get over is okay.<br>
You didn't get caught, so therefore it is okay to do.<br>
It's immoral bullshit and it is indeed true that younger generations have grown up in a different, less moral, less educated and less civilized world.<br>

And what do you say to those companies that are charging retarded prices for this stuff. Im sorry, but Photoshop shouldnt cost more the 20$. Sony Vegas? How about 10$. Companies have been fucking us over for years with shit products. How about when it was 15 to 20 dollars to buy a cd and that cd ends up having 1 decent song on the entire thing. How about the cost of going to a movie that ends up sucking like most other movies these days. Everytime I download something, I feel like Im repaying myself for all the crap I was conned into buying before the internet came along. So I say FUCK YOU and your scumbaggery to companies. Cause they are well aware they are selling shit, but they rarely care about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

also how they don't have there older versions on sale i.e. PS 6/7/etc.<br>
as soon as they produce a new version which could be within a years time or possibly sooner they move the other off the market which from a sales pov is fine for them so long as you can afford to keep up with the upgrades i would love to have a legitimately licensed copy of PS but its just not worth it</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

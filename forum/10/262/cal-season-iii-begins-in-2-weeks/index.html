	<div class="content">CAL-HL2DM season 3 will be kicking off the preseason on Monday, July 23rd.<br>
<br>
There are four leagues this season:<br>
1v1 Deathmatch<br>
2v2 Team Deathmatch<br>
4v4 Team Deathmatch<br>
5v5 Capture The Flag<br>
<br>
Match format for all leagues will be best 2 out of 3 rounds, with the away team choosing the round 1 map, the home team choosing the round 2 map and the weekly default map being used as the round 3 tiebreaker.<br>
<br>
Playoff format in all leagues will be top 8, double elimination. First match loss will send the player or team into the lower bracket; a second loss will remove them from the playoffs.<br>
<br>
Rosters are open for signups to all leagues as of now; teams previously entered will not need to re-signup, though any player or team that forfeits both of their matches during the preseason will be deactivated before the regular season starts.<br>
<br>
Match dates, maps and mapcycles, rules changes and updated cal.cfgs will be posted within the next 48 hours.<br>

Season 2 added the 1v1 competition at community request through a poll on the CAL forums (just ended as you said).<br>

Upcoming Season 3 has expanded into CTF 5v5 competition. I am glad they havent dropped any divisions, but for them to survive, we need get more teams involved in the 4v4 and 5v5 especially.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I might be game for 2v2 with you if you are interested, but then again it depends if i end up in $W before cal starts. We'll see.<br>

Edit: Actually I'm on a team called 'beta' with gas.mask. You can probably join up with us if you'd like, I'll make sure you play some games.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I also hope other people would give some changes a chance and join, otherwise the CTF season will phail.....like the ones before it D: D:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Is there any way to keep forfeits down in the new 1v1 season?  I was thinking maybe deactivate someone after a no reply in match comm one time and make them contact admin to be put back into rotation.  That's only if they failed to communicate in match comm or don't make an effort of some sort.  I'm sure everbody may have to forfeit after one time or another but I had so many no shows last season it wasn't funny.  <br>

	<div class="content">Yeah it sucks. That's on of the reasons I asked some of you from GoTg to play, coz CAL desperately needs people that will show up and play.<br>
<br>
If they could weed out the inactives earlier it would match up two players who want to play instead of all the players who want to play being matched with all the players who are just signing up for no reason. <br>
<br>
I wonder if there is a way to code all the people with no match comm into inactive status and pair them with each other so that all the active players get paired.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

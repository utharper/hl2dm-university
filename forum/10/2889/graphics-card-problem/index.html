You sound like you already know the problem. Time to buy a new card. You could always try it in another machine to make sure it's the graphics card. Or you could stick another gfx card in it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Okay fine that would be one step in the troubleshooting process. And when and if that doesnt work? He asked what his options were and asked for relevant help. I've given him the tools to continue his troubleshooting when or IF swapping the vid cards doesnt work or blowing them out and doing low level maintenance. <br>
<br>
Is hl2dm the only game that this happens in or is it all of them? And what do those blue screens say?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I had the same card and found out it had a chip nvidia admitted was faulty... failure on their part. I recommend either using ntune and manually increasing the fan speed to say 80 percent every time you play a game, or buying a new card. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

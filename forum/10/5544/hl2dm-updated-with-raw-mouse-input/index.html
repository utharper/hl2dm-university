	<div class="content">so is it automatic?<br>
<br>
or requires a setting of "1" or "0" somewhere in the cfg?<br>

EDIT:  nevermind.  the raw option is now part of the mouse UI.  i didnt read closely enough.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":oops:" title="Embarassed"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Seems like whenever TF2 or CSS gets an update they throw HL2DM in there as well..yet nothing happens for the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I emailed robin a couple of months ago asking for raw input. The main issue is with high DPIs and low sensitivities (which ironically, is the ideal thing to have). I noticed this when I got my 3.5G Deathadder and played TF2 using 3500 DPI. Whenever I'd move the mouse fast, to turn 180 degrees for instance, it would feel slower than usual and really weird (aka, negative acceleration), however, I didn't have anything like that in quake live (cuz I had raw input).<br>
After some research I understood what the problem was and sent the email, cuz I knew that using a sensitivity over 0.45 would make me skip pixels (therefore, having less precision and a not so smooth mouse movement), but I had no other choice than lowering my DPI and increasing my sensitivity (until now).<br>
So, basically, if you have always been a high sensitivity user, you probably won't tell the difference, but for low sens users, this is a huge bonus.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">oh, sure. I'm not so blind as to think they added the code because "I" said so. I only know that I emailed robin, but I'm sure I'm not the only one, and there were already threads regarding the negative acceleration problem around that time (the ones I read when I said I did some research), and I also know a couple of TF2 players were using a third party program(<a href="http://www.digitalise.net/2009/04/19/rinput-131-sequential-edition-released/" class="postlink">Rinput</a>) to have raw input (or that least I read that rumor on the razer blueprints forums).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">As far as i got to in the SP anyway, the game suffers from lack of ingenuity and originality storyline AND design wise. I think the alien invasion / virus outbreak / fight through underground canals / on riversides / on harbors / in cities narrative's had its time and place and was in any event executed far better way back in HL2.<br>
Another thing is the glaring run+crouch+slide ripoff from Brink. I mean...seriously. the game is a month out from release. this is just wrong lol.<br>
All n all it's not a bad SP. worth 10 bucks is my take.<br>
I am though looking forward to playing Brink's MP that's for sure. and of course././. . ....Portal 2 SP. the MP looks stupid.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Finished the game on PC and it was decent looks good even on the lowest setting "High" yes it is confusing althogh there is very little obvious difference between the settings you really have to look hard to find them.<br>
<br>
So glad they made the suit functions (cloak and armour) a direct bind this time around i was hoping they would do that it is something the first game lacked which made it harder to do exctly what I wanted at any given moment. Also including the speed function on sprint was a geat choice as was the power function enabling automatically when using melee or picking up heavy objects.<br>
<br>
The grabbing ledges was a very nice touch but often didnt work all the time due to positioning but when it did work it worked well and made getting away from enemies easy the same can be said with the slide which for some reason uses up suit energy.<br>
<br>
The suit upgrades seemed rather useless I only upgraded once which was silent steps and extra armour the rest to me are unnecessary, the only reason I saw for collecting the alien spore clouds was to recharge the suit energy I noticed the more I killed quickly the more chance I had of survival because of the suit power recharging giving me in some instances near unlimited cloak or armour modes.<br>
<br>
That brings me onto dificulty which was not all that hard to be honest partly due to the AI being really dumb at times but mainly due to the suits power, sure I died a fair amount of times its not like I beat the game in one sitting without dying once but the last battle was really rather pathetic it was far too easy for an end of game boss battle saving the world kind of thing.<br>
At least I actually finished it I have yet to finish Crysis1 because it bored me rigid.<br>
<br>
I give it an 8 due to small things that I found annoying.<br>
AI is garbage<br>
Mouse sens - I had to mess with configs to fix it yet still nto quite right, mounted turrets were too sensitive and as was the ADS on some guns.<br>
Sound - The music was too loud even on low it often overpowered the sound effects and voiceovers also no way to turn it off in the FMV when game is loading and people explain the mission to you.<br>
<br>
If you want to play online just create a bogus Gamespy account then enter in a random CD-key and bingo you can play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is a config tweaker app soemone made which you can set to remove mouse accelrartion and smoothing which I expect you are noticing like many other PC gamers.<br>

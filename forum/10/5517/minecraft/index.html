Game is fucking awesome.  Multiplayer IS in now, look up nossr50's server (4chan server).  I recommend playing for a while by yourself first to learn the game before trying multiplayer.  Try different things like building a huge mine or a castle or something, crafting everything you can, and explore the continents for a really long distance.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Multiplayer IS in, it's just in the very early stages right now.  No monsters enabled yet really, so it's still only good for building huge shit and fucking around.  It'll be there eventually though.<br>

	<div class="content">it is worth it. It's worth way more than what they charge now. and multiplayer does work, but you have to enter a server IP, no server browser since it's still in alpha. also, like con said, there's gonna be an update the 31st that is going to be awesome. Also i think they say the size of an ingame map is 8 times the surface of the earth and it would take multiple lifetimes to explore everything.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think some servers do have working monsters <span style="text-decoration:underline">but</span> you cant kill them unless you bring out the fire.<br>
<br>
Has anyone see the stats on the number of people buying and playing it. Far out! Notch must be a millionaire in the space of a year seeing as it cost me $13 when I bought it.<br>

A huge monolithic structure that reached to the top of the skybox and had an internal glass platform that lead to a chasm. That chasm reached as down as the game would let us go and we had glass walls holding the molten lava at bay for a very nice effect. My two friends and I got the whole server working on it, and around the very starting point of the monolith we had encased an afk player in admin blocks. <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I made a triforce temple once..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I once made a giant egg from sea-level to top of sky with water flowing over the edges. And a bungalow, cause bungalows are cool.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Mustangs are one of the most easily customizable and fastest cars on the market. They have a unique sound and look nice. I'm more of a fan of the 89 fox body and 04 and below cars. Never really got into the 05 and on versions because they were lowered in their ability to make them reliable street cars and plus the look is alright.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's sexy. <br>
My uncle owned a S351 R Code Saleen. Black on black exterior/interior and was the only model like that for the year 1995. And during that year it was the fastest production vehicle made. It was nice, but like everything he sold it for something faster. <br>
I love mustangs and plan to get a 5.0 coupe and put a blower on it, get it cool aired with a flow master and depending on if i use it just for street races or to show off I'll be putting in a nice stereo system, but if I'm going to be racing a lot, the less weight, the better. <br>
Honestly my dream car is simply the Dodge Viper SRT10. The newer ones look beautiful, but the older ones like the 99' model are more sturdier and you can get them to 1000 horsepower easily.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nice!!  I don't really have a dream car except I wanted to take a brand new GT Mustang and have the C500 upgrade installed from <a href="http://www.cervinis.com" class="postlink">http://www.cervinis.com</a>, but that's another $26,000 on top of the price of the new Mustang so that will never happen unless I win the lottery.  I'm more into motorcycles now and am still debating whether I want to put money down on a 2009 Star Vmax!  We'll see!!<br>
<br>
Sorry for hijacking your thread DEFme, it's your fault for posting the picture of the Mustangs!!   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Today is the vernal equinox.  Tomorrow is kind of it, too, depending on how you look at it.  There are as many hours and minutes of daylight and nighttime - 12 and 12 - all across the whole globe.  I didn't know that last part, that it's <em class="text-italics">everywhere</em> 12 and 12.  Moscow to Sydney, 12 and 12.  It's also a really important date for cultures around the world and throughout time for religious and survival reasons.  A lot of ancient cultures built massive structures and things that were astronomical/astrological devices which marked the equinox.  Think about it.. an ancient Celt, dependent (you still are) on agriculture for survival.  Your farmers'd better know when to plant those crops so you get a harvest, so you need to know where you in time in relation to when you can plant to get a harvest.  So, they/you build/t this giant huge mathematically precise beautiful thing called Stonehenge.. to know when to plant, as a religious and survival calendar.  (Some say Stonehenge was built by Merlyn.. I have no comment on that particular tale at this time.  I may nor may not have been there; or it may not yet be time to reveal my hand in such undertakings.)<br>
<br>
Bottom line: It's a day for beginnings and hope, and revitalization of our spirits.  It's a day to get in touch with yourself and your photosynthetically reliant food supply and the earth and the cosmos.  All of which are the same thing, no?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>

Merry equinox and much love.<br>

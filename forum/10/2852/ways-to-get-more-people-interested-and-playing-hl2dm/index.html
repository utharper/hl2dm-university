	<div class="content">HL2DM is now completely free, which will attract players that hear about it. But another part is being able to get people to even hear about the offers. Deathmatch isn't over by a long shot. idSoftware is going to be releasing Quake Live rather soon as well. They share a same platform in that they are (will-be) completely free to play. I don't believe idSoftware would bother with any manpower for QL if they felt there wasn't a chance at it being successful. To me this means that DM can still attract new players and show some overall growth. Especially considering its winter time (atleast in America), a good time to attract new players to the game. VALVe games also tend to have a longer lifespan than most others, hell even CS1 is still one of the top games played, and that was released almost a decade ago.<br>
<br>
Ways you can help would be to go to forums and post about the free offers. I've started one at the Xfire forums (<a href="http://www.xfire.com/xf/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=209509" class="postlink">http://www.xfire.com/xf/modules.php?nam ... c&amp;t=209509</a>) and will probably hit up some others soon. But don't be shy, get the news out there that its completely free. Also, tell people about good servers that will treat them with respect and are fun to play on. And I know most University goers are good about helping interested players learn the game already.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I even made DM it's own bebo page = <a href="http://www.bebo.com/hl2dm" class="postlink">http://www.bebo.com/hl2dm</a>  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
I added almost everyone that has anything HL related on their bebo page and people from other groups like TF2, Halo, CS and other FPS and PC gamer groups, I tried to write some shit about the game but wasn't really sure where to start so I probably nicked a few things from this site, but only cos it's so well written lol (ty wt). I also added all the best videos from youtube, so visitors know what's good and what's not.<br>
<br>
If you're on bebo add the page and post something, if you want to help admin or add something to the page pm me or something.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Most of upcoming games will now be free. Companies learnt that piratery can't be stopped, and that they can earn more money by offering videogames for free to all global population but spamming them with ingame ads. And the worst thing is they're going to sale private items. For example, in CoD4 you need to earn some achievements and you get blocked weapons or perks. But now, you can buy them. And if you don't pay for them, you can't use them.<br>
<br>
So, HL2DM being and old, broken and left-behind game, has no chances at all with new and free videogames like Battlefield Heroes, Call of Duty 6, Quake Live, etc.<br>
<br>
Sorry guys.<br>

Seriously, if you want to this game rises you need to make a HUGE event like FiOS, so Valve can pay more attention to their game and maybe update it into Source2007. Make some really interesting LAN events, then spread it through Internet so everybody can download it and participate in the Online leagues like CAL, since both things are for free it shouldn't be a problem.<br>
<br>
But I forgot, you need a lot of money =O</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I just hate when something becomes a business..... no one does it from the heart anymore...<br>
They don't think on the consumer, they hypocritely think on their bank accounts, exclusively.<br>
Market studies evaluate what sells, not what ppl could get to enjoy. And then we get to that, if it's free, then you should suspect money will go in from somewhere. Unless is freeware under the GNU GPL.<br>
<br>
Sorry for going off the topic, but I take this very deeply with sadness. I'm an honest (stupid?)person.<br>

PS: It makes me especially sad that music is on the same track... and so is everything in the world.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think that's a rather pretentious way of atracting ppl to a game.<br>
It sounds like "Please, the game is dying, join the comunity and play the game just to help us save it!"<br>
<br>
I rather help the "noobs" in what I can, even after they call me a cheater, and sometimes I even say "gg, <a href="http://www.hl2dm-univerity.com" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-univerity.com</a>" like the guys from the U do when they leave the servers. Subtle, but may be effective.<br>
<br>
I think the best would be to educate the "noobs" by spreading the knowledge we have so that they can stick to the game and consequencially get their exitement to their friends, leading "outsiders" to try it out knowing already what the game is about.<br>
...Imo...<br>
<br>
We would need to lead some ppl to try other weapons besides RPG and SMG. Unfortunatelly there's a big scale of players who "only know" those two weapons, making themselves too vulnerable when they dont have them (or have no more ammo), consequentially leading them to quti the game. Thats what usually happens when I'm playing only against "noobs", I end up alone in the server. I'm gonna start spectating when I'm in such situation. I don't want to lower their morale or something and make them quti.<br>
<br>
In short: We should "grab" the ones we have instead of scaring them, and even instead of pulling the ones we don't have. No one ever reacts well when is feeling pulled into something, rather than compeled to do it.<br>
<br>
Another thing that may lead many "noobs" to quti is the approach that many "good" players have towards them (forgetting that THEY were noobs once, too):<br>
<br>
"GoodP" - fucking noob...<br>
"Noob"   - FU hotshot<br>
"GoodP" - 1 vs 1?<br>
"Noob"   - What for?<br>
"GoodP" - So I can own your fuckin ass. NOOB<br>
"Noob"   - ... (quits or gets even more mad and they start a useless and pointless fight and the "noob" gets a big bad impression on the HL community, possibly leading him to never return)<br>
<br>
(names are in quotation marks only because in most occasions neither one is a GOOOOOD player neither the other is a noob. So called noobs may play for long time, they just never learned anything new.)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

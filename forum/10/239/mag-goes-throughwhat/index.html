<br>
wt if i could stop "warping" i would, it makes it harder to hit people with registration. <br>
as a plus people complain that the same is true when they're trying to shoot me...<br>
<br>
i'm on wireless 54g (54mbs good signal)cable connection (TV room and computer room too far apart to run cat5 cable), i get little choke less than 10 and fps goes from 50-100 depending on map and # of players....<br>
<br>
so not sure why it happens.<br>
<br>
anyway,  can i record my self on a server i create, and watch 3rd person? i'm thinking w/out source tv no...or would I need to have someon connect to LAN and then watch from spec...if i could even do that on a srvr i create...gah...time to get some sunlight on my eyelids for friday margarita lunch...<br>
<br>
also the pictures here(at work) are Red x's can you all see them? i am ass.u.me'ing so</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

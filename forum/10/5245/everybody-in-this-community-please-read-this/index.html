im gonna try and keep my cool on this because this is one of the most fucked up things ive ever heard and im hoping its not true.  i just talked to Frank about this so im assuming its true because frank wouldnt lie to me, i know that.  <br>
<br>
can you please explain to me why you decided you could pocket all the money we all sent to you for the memorial tee-shirts after Mike's passing?  that money was supposed to go to Mike's family.  not only that, but you didnt even send Frank and his family their tee-shirts.  so basically you fucked over not only everybody that sent you money, but more importantly you fucked over Frank and his family.  how exactly can you justify using the death of a respected member of this community as an oppertunity to run a scam to make money?  frank tells me you keep dodging him and telling him you are/were sick.  i was under the impression you do this as a business, so im pretty fucking sure you have ppl that could have sent out those shirts and money.  i think you have a lot of explaining to do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
well....we weren't just sending him money, we were buying memorial tee shirts to remember Mike.  because what he was charging us was not the cost, the extra was supposed to go to mike's family.  while this community can be fucked up from time to time, i dont think any of us ever thought bEe was going to pull something as insane as this.  is there a way an admin can see when the last time he logged onto this site was?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

-EDIT My guess is from looking at the Facebook, he knows those people IRL or something and just posed as them, or just took the name from googling. Cause, the people there seem to be a family of some sort, and the page is run by a woman, who also refers to herself as the artist.<br>

Hind sight is 20/20 vision but it is kinda odd that some guy that hadnt even been active on here all of a sudden wanted to do all this work for the community out of the goodness of his heart.  Does anyone recall him even playing much in the before Mike's death?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is one of those things that I don't believe happened with full intention.  I think he got the money, intended to give it to Mike's family, then maybe decided to pay a bill or two and give the money on a later day when he built up a bit, but that day never came.<br>
I talked to bEe a few times back before Mike's death and he seemed like a nice guy, but was kinda down on his luck.  What he did was shitty, but I don't think it was a con from the beginning.  More like a guy who made a mistake and doesn't want to own up to it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

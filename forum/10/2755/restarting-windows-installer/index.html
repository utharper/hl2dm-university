	<div class="content">Take the HD and put the jumper on the slave position (look at diagram usually on top of HD) then open your other pc and put your good HD jumper on master posistion, plug in a power cable to the bad HD and plug a ide cable into the bad hd and mobo. Depending on what kind of ide cable( providing your newer good HD is IDE and not SATA) you have now it may have a extra plug in on it, if so use it. You dont really have to mount the bad HD in the case just set it somewhere maybe on top of the other HD. Boot up the newer pc, it should recognize the new HD as a slave and then it will show in your My computer tab as drive D or E w/e just right click on it and select format, chose ntfs option and start it. When its done formatting put it back in old pc, change pins back to master on both HD's and then you can reinstall windows xp on the newly formatted HD.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If they formatted it properly it should have removed it. On another note don't use that download I gave you, it got corrupted somehow in the process of uploading it to the ftp server. This likely what  caused your problem in the first place. I found this out by downloading the file and trying to use it myself, had same problem as you with the error. I fixed my HDD by reformatting it in another pc and then used the good source file for the download I gave you and it worked. Been wanting to tell you this but you haven't been on steam.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The game gets heavily modded with retard mods, servers get filled with bots, and there are noobs running rampant thinking there's nobody else around that was ever as good as they are right now.<br>
The end is near people, and I think at some point we should plan a giant going away party and let this game go out on a high note instead of the slow, painful death alot of games end up with.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">the pub scene is indeed dead, at least in europe. i remember 1 year ago there were these pubs where top players regularly went to and you could have some really epic games with them especially when the server was full and it was non stop shooting. id really like it if the pub scene somehow resurrected. the players i used to play with on pubs are still active but i dont know of any good server where we all could meet. <br>
<br>
as for competitive hl2dm, clans united is currently running 3 different competitions: a 3v3 league (4x8 teams), a 2v2 league (4x8 teams) and a nations cup (only the finals left which will be played by hungary and nordic). players whove been in the game a really long time are starting to leave, but at the same time newcomers are getting better and better every day and there are players i didnt use to think of as good players but now i do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i do get disappointed looking for servers.  although i like a variety of maps, there are times i want some practice on certain CAL maps and can't find a server with players on it.  nothing irritates me more than to jump onto a server running a CAL map and realizing its low-grav or the weapons are modded.<br>
<br>
i do think the khaos pub is one of the better servers out there.  true, some people don't like the map variety, and i may be a bit biased.  but it does draw some of the better players from time to time and makes for a challenging pub scene (at least for me).<br>
<br>
edges server is pretty smooth and draws some very skilled players, but its very sporadic.  the porn server is also very smooth, but lately i've been getting the "hey uber dude, go away, we're just having fun" comments.  me?  wtf??? <br>
<br>
i can almost always find someone playing on a FF or OFC server, and they run a nice variety of maps.  but i generally get chastised for spawn killing, when i don't think i am.  then i pass by every respawn only to get a grenade rolled up my ass after passing by.    <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br>
<br>
the other day i was banned from a server after getting 3 quick kills.  the ban reason given was "scripting".  wtf?  if that happens to me, i can only imagine the troubles you skilled players have finding a decent pub that won't ban you.<br>
<br>
i still don't think the game is dying, but it does seem to be regressing.  then again, i'm a diehard that plays no other games... so maybe i cant face up to reality.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Again, it seem amazing the people have the solution right in front of their eyes and still choose to ignore it - hl2dmpro is right here. free. and bug free.<br>

It's not that Valve WANTS to kill DM. it's simply a financial mistake to go back developing a game that IS NOT BRINGING ANY REVENUES. so...if someone were to come up with the fixes and updates for this game VALVe will sure enough accept it and make it official. Someone HAS. and it's right here. fully functional and working almost flawlessly.<br>
No need to KILL anything just open your eyes and look at the possibilities.<br>

Not sure if you have played the latest release but, they have redone the netcode to some extent and I think its pretty good, definitely not worse than regular hl2dm.

In truth i never liked pubs never really played them long because it just becomes to easy only becomes fun when you got some good players on the server. I mostly just play ctf and runoff for pub games.<br>
<br>
I had the idea of making a topic of good servers and sharing them with each other its a pain to search thro all thos servers to find a decent one.<br>
<br>
actual scrim games are very much live and kicking down in Europe I get allot of players asking for a game and there a increase of players wanting to join the clan.<br>
<br>
hl2dmpro well I have played it problem is that there not enough servers and is not seen in the mainstream as hl2dm which you get with hl2 and the ep thing is people need to know about it for there to be interest. Only if valve gave us the power to update hl2dm the game seeing that they are to busy with more important stuff that makes money.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i can almost always find someone playing on a FF or OFC server, and they run a nice variety of maps.  but i generally get chastised for spawn killing, when i don't think i am.  then i pass by every respawn only to get a grenade rolled up my ass after passing by.    <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>
I'm with you there.  The FF servers always seem to have players on them, and you do have to watch your back sometimes while trying to follow the "no spawn killing" rule.  Overall I like the FF servers a lot because 1.  they keep the map rotation fresh and sometimes novel, 2. the average skill level of the players there has been gradually increasing over the past year.  (maybe because the scene at large has been shrinking?)<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>the other day i was banned from a server after getting 3 quick kills.  the ban reason given was "scripting".  wtf?  if that happens to me, i can only imagine the troubles you skilled players have finding a decent pub that won't ban you.</div></blockquote>
That exact thing happened to me on the STK servers, and I know they get better players than me all the time.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>i still don't think the game is dying, but it does seem to be regressing.  then again, i'm a diehard that plays no other games... so maybe i cant face up to reality.</div></blockquote>
The game is shrinking.  Noobs are key, and there are fewer noobs than people departing the game.  What I think the game needs is for Valve to promote it at least a little bit when Ep3 comes out by including DM and putting in a few encouraging words to at least try it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It may be a bit different than it is now or was before but there will always be people playing it, even when the people who play this game nonstop move on to something else there will always be someone else playing it. This is evidenced by a game I played over 10 years ago, soldier of fortune 1 and 2. I remember back in 2004 when hl2 came out every one in the SOF2 community was like oh shit SOF2 is dead and HL2 is going to put the final nail in the coffin. Well guess what I just fired it up and there are still servers up and low and behold people playing it, lol and trust me that game had nothing on this game. The fact it is still being played proves this game will never die.<br>
The second thing in this games favor is that Game Dev's are no longer actively looking at PC games as a viable option, they are not profitable any more and cost way to much to support with all the different hardware configs out there compared to consoles, not to mention the piracy issue involved with pc games which hardly exists at the console level. There are certain people like me who are a PC fanatic and does not even own a console and likely won't, for us we will never leave the best game ever to hit the PC, and likely the last great one which will ever be seen on the pc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Alot of reasons the game isnt as strong as it used to be is because clans arent pubbing anymore. They are just waiting around to have a 3 v 3 scrim or whatever in their locked server. Pubbing keeps games alive. For example, a new player downloads hl2dm, checks servers and only sees killbox low grav servers, coop dogshit servers, or servers with mods that make no sense whatsoever and the title of the server doesnt even say it is modded. They are not getting a chance to play this game the way it is meant to be played and leaving after playing in some crap server that makes the game look like crap. When this game was rocking, I could bring up my favorites tab with at least 15 to 20 servers that i pinged well in with stock settings and maps.That list was much bigger with a better internet. I remember seeing players pub all day long in our server, everyday of the week. This was ofcourse when the game was new, but why should that matter? This game is free now. It should be doing better then it is considering.<br>
<br>
Ground Zero will cater to whoever wants to pub and will continue to do so until nobody is playing this game. If anyone has map suggestions, give us a shout. Think there is something the server needs to better the pubbing experience? Give us a shout. We will have friday night fights every friday night and the server is open to anyone looking for a good pubbing experience. The current map cycle has a good group of league maps along with oldschool favorites.<br>

Im not talking down on other mods or servers that are modded. I used to run tons of mods on 1 of our dm servers.

The only real problem with this and other stock setting pubs these days is that the random element clears out fast when a skilled player joins, which isnt much incentive for competitive clans to keep up a pub, since theyll rarely get to enjoy a full game on their own servers- except with other skilled players- who they could have just scrimmed on a locked/cheaper server in the first place.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We need servers like these like as said in a other post we needed to provide stepping stones for players to get into the competitive side of the game.<br>

sorry but i'll say it again and more clearly - this game is NOT lacking in players for any of these reasons. This game, when not played at lowG, coop or whateverhaveyou is a VERY HARD GAME TO MASTER. so noobs run away from it, you all see it day in and day out. that's one. two : public taste has shifted from dm based games to co-op based games. very easy to see if you just open your eyes and look around you. i LOVE hl2dm and will never stop playing it as long as it is there to be played but i'm also not stupid and don't indulge in illusions.<br>
I think it's time this community wakes up to reality and do the right thing - deal with reality and seek the AVAILABLE possibilities.<br>
We are always talking about how to improve the game, how to lure more people in, how to make Valve not kill it... When the solution is RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF US. so in my pov all this talking is nonsense and the best i can describe it is Middle Age Crisis, like one who can't get over the fact he's not a kid anymore. get the F over it, pick up the slack and realize times have changed. instead of posting bombastic threads like "yea, the game HAS died, R.I.P" prove you're more than words and do what you CAN to heal, recreate and secure this great game. In other words - JOIN THE ONES WHO ARE ALREADY DOING IT AS THESE WORDS AS WRITTEN.<br>

I'm not sure what you mean by "holds this game alive" but if low-grav, killbox, coop, etc are the future of this game then it may as well be dead and I'm pretty sure that's the point we're trying to get across.<br>
<br>
The reason I, personally, look down on those players is because they play in a 'bubble'. They are oblivious to anything outside of their server and even still manage to suck horribly. Not helpful to the community in any way.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Oh right your servers are full therefore they are good? Face it, nobody but nobos plays in those servers. A few players may have switched over but 95% of the people that play there simply talk on the mic and suck at the game. How exactly do they help the community at all? HL2:DM is a hardcore game in its nature and it's the reason most people like the game. All of those servers could fucking die for all I care and the world would be a better place.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Exactly my point. You run your servers for your members only. Your members do nothing but play in a handful of servers. They never contribute to the community, never play against anyone of real skill, and play in a 'bubble'. That is why the game is dying, thanks for proving my point.<br>

The only real problem with this and other stock setting pubs these days is that the random element clears out fast when a skilled player joins, which isnt much incentive for competitive clans to keep up a pub, since theyll rarely get to enjoy a full game on their own servers- except with other skilled players- who they could have just scrimmed on a locked/cheaper server in the first place.</div></blockquote>

<br>
not really any stock pubbers left.  When I tried to redo the war room server that was obvious only players that joined where on my friends list.  And wanted to scrim.   Either they have there own pub ie Khoas's (pubbing division) or mK's maybe a few others that run stock only.<br>
<br>
KB's are easier for new players to get into since it is easier to get a kill.  IE you don't have to know the in and out of the map.  Just get a 357 and use you aim.  (note KB players I am not saying new players going 40-2 against the best comp) but being able to spray smg fire across the map and the 10th life they get a kill.  Same with skullshock new players can jump in and get kills.  When I had my laptop and left it idle in The War room with respawn on within a hour or so the server would be full of new noobs that would leave within the first death if anyone skilled joined.<br>
<br>
<br>
UNI needs to get the NA pubs together somehow (uni Pub night) maybe getting pub owners to put a tag on the end of the pubs name like [Stock UNI], [KB UNI], [LGKB UNI]  that meet a certain criteria.  Something to make the pubs stand out from the rest of the idle mindless pubs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL, Pro is terrible if you are looking for a hl2dm clone. It's nothing like hl2dm. Gauss Guns? Come on now. Perhaps if they would of kept the game identical to hl2dm, but fixed the bugs, they would of had a shot. I still disagree with you about modded servers keeping this game alive. That is only the case because all the servers ARE modded. You say that stock pubs are worthless once a good player joins, thats bs too. If there were 100 stock servers, those better players would be spread out amongst the servers and it would balance out. Back when this game first came out, there were plenty of players ahead of the curve and I rarely saw players leave because of it and if they did, there were 80 other stock servers to play in. The day that the good players started running in packs and all stock servers became locked for scrims, is the minute this game started to go down hill. Players that started on stock servers are much more likely to go find a coop or killbox server for some fun more then a coop or killbox player searching for a stock server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
that's not true vox,  the are contributing to the community by playing in the public they are bring new players to the game and giving them a fair chance to get some kills and first enjoy the game then improve.   Think about the shitty team you started with they came and scrimmed with you got rocked only to never play the game again.  You did well so you stuck with the game.  Now if they joined a KB pub and went 32-32 and had fun maybe they would have played there for a few months gotten better then tried there luck at some stock scrims.<br>

i never wrote any of that. please refer to my post if you're quoting me.<br>
i wrote that no one should look down on any other players, servers or mods.<br>
what <strong class="text-strong">i wrote</strong> in reference to what kept the game alive was that largely KB, LowG, Co-ops and puzzles did. there are also a lot of pubs playing Overwatch, Runoff and Lockdown 24-7. the later made the other large chunk of this community and still is.<br>
From my own experience...most of the better players in the KB/LowG scene move on to stock play. i hardly ever seen anything like that on the stock 3400 slots OW servers. as Keeper pointed out above...the KB portion of this community contributed and still does (!!!) a lot. and clearly cannot be looked down upon.<br>

<br>
For a game to survive it needs newbs. Without them you lose all the following things:<br>
1) Player count<br>
2) Game support (Valve almost did this at one time)<br>
3) Recruiting ground (we were all newbs once)<br>
4) Incentive to host servers<br>
5) Variety (playing different people)<br>
<br>
However, games die very slowly. I have friends and relatives who still play HL1 every day at lunch. I've asked them why and they said nothing else matches the feel. There's probably some nostalgia mixed in for them too. It's kind of the same for me and this game. Once in a while I start it up, but after a few minutes I realize I don't really care to play anymore, for a host of reasons.<br>
<br>
I think the community as a whole just has to decide, with all the items above missing, whether the game is still a fun experience overall. If it is, just keep playing. If it's not, stop playing. It's quite simple.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ive played it, and its not any better than stock hl2dm. The vast majority of the real gamekilling bugs are still there, and a couple new bugs have cropped up that, at last check, still arent fixed. The devs chose to spend their time and effort adding useless fluff (irc client / winamp plugin / web browser / custom gui to edit pretty much every game parameter) instead of fixing core issues, and the mod has a 2-digit player base as a result.<br>
<br>
If i could code, id have started on a true pro mod long ago, and id still love to see it happen even so, but i think if anyone in the community had the skills and drive to do so, it would have happened by now, so at this point its likely were stuck with stock hl2dm and valves nonexistant interest for the rest of the games life.<br>
<br>
And that said, the game isnt dying, in that it doesnt have any less players than it did 2 years ago; those players just happen to all be crammed into killbox/coop/puzzle/insertrandommodhere/insertgimpymaphere servers instead of playing stock.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No I havent played the latest version and the reason why is that the last time I checked out the mod, it had players jumping all over the place with gauss guns. That was my experience when I first loaded up the mod and went into a server. That was also my last experience as I removed the game and never played it again. When I went there, I was looking for hl2dm with fixed bugs and that is not what I got. Maybe that is why there are like 5 servers and 0 players that have been playing hl2dm:pro. Perhaps it would of been a different experience if I would of loaded it up and joined a vanilla DM server, but that is my whole point related to dm:pro and hl2dm. If your first experience sucks, then it's hard to try again. Ive only seen a handful of you guys even supporting hl2dm:pro. That is no reason for me to even bother checking it out. I personnally would rather play Hl2:CTF then HL2dm:pro any day. HL2:CTF also has a hl2dm vanilla mode that nobody plays...<br>

I hope it gains more popularity. I also am hoping HL2:CTF gains more popularity when we release the next version of it.

	<div class="content">No offense intended to Valar or Keeper or anyone else that plays KB, low grav, etc.  I am not being elitist, I am just stating how I feel and yes I do lament the fact that there are not more stock settings servers.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, as I am entitled to mine and you to yours.  <br>
<br>
If it gets to the point where the ONLY thing there is is KB, low grav, shell shock, skull shock and the stock gravity, "stock" type maps/servers are completely gone and we cant find a game in a stock type map, settings server, then I will find another game to play because I do not care for those.  Sorry but I just dont.   That that is how I feel and it isnt being elitist.    I started on stock settings servers and that is what I grew to love.  The things and game play that I love this game for are not in killbox and low grav maps or skul shock and shell shock mods.  Gravity gun is almost pointless on any low grav map and on most killbox.  Advanced movement is gone on gravity lower than about 450. Its not the same game for me and I dont enjoy playing those types of maps, sorry.  Skul shock changes the weapons damage settings so that the smg is way over powered so that kills are easier to get with them and imo changes the balance so much it ruins the game.  Shell shock, well, no grav gun = not hl2dm to me.<br>
<br>
This is why Khaos maintains its own pub, we generally don't like other peoples pubs and there are very few other than our own that we will play on.  Also, the members that do pub like to play a variety of maps, not the same 6-10 maps that many will only play.<br>
<br>
That said there are many CAL level players that started out in Killbox servers and then moved on to try normal gravity and to play CAL.   Yes those servers are more popular because it is easier to get kills.  I know of at least one person that plays alot on skul shock because he does well there. When he plays on our server, he dies too much and its not fun for him.  And yes unfortunately, the newer people tend to get driven out of a server when someone with skill comes on.  Hell even I drive people out of servers at times and I am no where close to being considered a L33t player.  Many of those people do eventually seek out places like the DMU when they do get to a point where they see themselves getting better and they crave more knowledge to continue that progression.  Many just dont give a damn and just play for fun and dont want to work at getting better, others just go play other games.<br>
<br>
The game has definately changed since I started playing which was some time just before Fios.  There were always killbox and low grav servers, but there were many many more stock servers than there are now.  So many good servers have gone.  Im not sure its ever going to go back to what it was, as much as many of us would like it to.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Pretty much. Fios was certainly after it's peak. I wouldnt say that it was dead, but it was starting to become segregated. This game was in bad shape the moment that Valve decided it was worthless to them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If we pick up valve slack then may be there can be hl3dm or hl2dm source or somthing like they did with css but i don't know anything about doing that sort of stuff i not sure others do to.<br>
<br>
hl2dmpro I see a a complete different entity it does not come free and available like when you bought hl2 or esp 1 or 2 it came with it with hl2dm:pro you have to go out and find it and that alone reduces the amount of players allot. Plus it seems to me hl2dm:pro is more based on hldm with the gauss gun and such. I don't think hl2dm:pro is the answer but the approach to community regulated game those seem to be on the right track. <br>
<br>
There is a reason why games try not have a steep learning curv. Some of you despise of this tactic but it keeps people in the game and makes game companies money and provides more players to play against which is so important to a multiplayer. But that aside more focusing on this game im glad there are killbox server and co-op and run-off and ctf because at least it get people playing long enough to the point where they want learn more and get into stock playing. I know many players that play these servers and when they see hl2dm frag movie they feel inspired to go and learn it. Those that think that these servers damage the community are sadly wrong though there is truth that there is not enough stock servers which i think there should be.  <br>
<br>
When I a started the game and joined a stock server i was bored very quick simply because i did not know the movement and stuff that makes it enjoyable and never went back to it for another 6 months. When i came back i found a ctf that got me hooked where i played it enough and found so extra stuff and put in the time to learn it. This game would be dead with out these sort of servers simple as you got to be blind not to realize that.<br>
<br>
3,000 players play this game daily and is 9th highest multi-player that steam provides that is not a dead game by any means. But look at css 100,000 players daily kind show you what lack of surport and direction can do in hampering a game such as ours. If only if we grabbed the bull by the horns and do what they did with css.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

it has a vanilla mode that is SUPPOSED to be the same as the original, valve made hl2dm. i tried the latest version yesterday and i wasnt happy. its just not the same. the movement feels different, i dont know how to describe it but its somehow different and i dont like it. when you play a game for years you become so familiar with the game mechanics that you can notice even the tiniest difference when somethings changed. also in an earlier version, combine balls killed the players who fired them. maybe the devs fixed that problem by now but who knows what other kinds of things - things that are behind the curtains - they changed to their own taste that we dont immediately notice. these small tweaks/changes (call em whatever you like) may not be visible but overall they make the game feel different.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I gotta agree with SND just above. Low gravs,SkullShocks, and headshot sound bites are what made being a complete N00b at least enjoyable. And it helped the learning curb quite a bit.<br>
<br>
I was a complete n00b to FPS and PC multiplayer gaming a little over a year ago when I picked up this game. I didn't know how to chat, or that other weapons besided the smg even existed. I remember walking in a straight line with primary fire held toward the first person I saw every time I spawned, it really wasn't that long ago. <br>
<br>
But then something happened, I found the mag and got good at sniping with it cause someone at the KAThouse told me how. I  looked on youtube to see if there were any videos on this game I thought was so cool. I found Master Viktory's More Than a Game movie and I thought it was the SHIT. Then I see Briggs on a map killing everyone and I have to know how he moves so fast. It's like what Dirk was saying, if there's a real dividing factor in this game it's bhop vs no bhop. If you don't bhop and don't want to then  you aren't going to want to be on a server with someone who does. And it's just too much effort for a GAME to learn for some people. I enjoy learning tricks techninques, I find that exciting, but I also know I'm not the average social gamer just looking for someone to chat on the mic with and sip Bud light while sniping another unnamed from my favorite camp spot. Some people don't even see grav gunning that special spot on the sink so you fly across the map as worth learning. It just doesn't excite them. <br>
<br>
On the flip side, I see a lot of people still wanting to know the tricks to this game, and I really don't notice a drop in the number of players from a year ago, which is all I have for reference. I like to watch the old frag vids and wonder who all those players were I wish I could play today <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> . So I can't say the game is dying at all. But of course, I wasn't anywhere near here during or before FIOS. I didn't know what FPS stood for back then.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not sure if that is directed at me Valar, but I was not the one that started this thread and I did say it was not done for me yet.  I will continue to do what I can to help keep this game going for as long as we can.  It will take the cooperation of many people to do that.

Of course it is up for debate. The fact folks disagree with you is evidence.<br>

There is a killbox division in CAL this season. Did you know this?<br>

	<div class="content">Well, going back a few years to when you guys were talking about the killbox players all crammed in their servers.  Yeah, they play in there, and they can actually get kinda good.  Theres tons of potentially good players in there, but they have no idea on how to do any of the stuff.  I mean, when "elitest" players like me or somebody else go in there and rape them, and they're like "How you move so fast?" and we just tell them hax or cause you suck or something else that just fucks it all up right there.<br>
<br>
I know, from my experience, that I could never have gotten good at all if I hadn't had people to train me and talk to me about what I'm doing.  I could NOT have come here and gotten good just from reading these peoples dumbass posts and watching videos.  I remember watching seagulls bhopping tutorial and I was like "wtf this is retarded it doesnt make sense omfg i cant do it oooooomfg"  That was when I was still uber noob though, so if I had maybe a little idea of what bhopping was and how to do it then maybe I would have gotten more from his tutorial.<br>
<br>
When you link somebody to this dipshit website &amp; they've never heard of it you're pretty much dooming them right there, unless they have a ridiculous motivation to figure out how you're so good, cause they're going to read some dumb fuckin thread like this named hl2dm is dead, made by some guy who doesnt play anymore and hasnt played in many months besides like twice, theyre gonna be like oh fuck this I'll keep killboxing &amp; playing CoD or Gaylo 3.<br>
<br>
I would compare linking someone to this website to, say, if I saw a guy play some Dragonforce on a guitar, and I was like ultra noob.  So he melts my ears and I'm like OOMFG HOW YOU DO DAT I WANT TO!!!  And he says GG go to dragonforce-university.com  Later.<br>
Dragonforce Rapist has left the game. (Disconnect by user.)<br>
<br>
So I go to this website and it's full of dumbass posts like this (ZOMGZ DRAGONFORCE IS DEAD!!!!)  And the shit is so complex for me, since I've never played guitar before (or bhopped in any other game).  I would just give up really quick.<br>
<br>
Maybe if us "elitests," when we go into a killbox server every once in a while, and we get the inevitable hax or how are you so good, and instead we say oh, well I use the physics of the game to allow me to move faster, and say hey add me to friends and I'll show you some shit later on, and then we talk to them on steam friends and just get them moving around in a server and talking to them, we might get the occasional new pro.  But, I mean, only go that far with like a guy that seems to have a genuine interest.  If it's some 8 year old on the mic crying say fuck em.  Or when you tell him what you're doing and he says something sarcastic or makes it sound like he doesnt care, fuck em.<br>
<br>
Also, this thread deserves deletion.<br>

	<div class="content">holymoly, you think its completly dead and dont want to play, fine then don't.  You are entitled to your opinion.  Delete the game and go play/do something else with best wishes for a great life from all of us.  Some of us still want to play until it is not only gasping for breath but six feet down in a hole having the dirt shoveled on top of it, or maybe until the grass is sprouting on top of the grave.  <br>
<br>
Personally I also have not found a game I could play as much or as long as hl2dm.  TF2 is too slow.  Crysis wars is fun for an hour or two, but its limited amout of good maps makes it meh after that.  And L4D, well here there are so many zombie hordes you can mow through before it just gets repetative and *YAWN*.   This is the only game that truely still holds a challenge after a month of playing, the rest just become old hat by then.<br>

Well the difference was they were retards then and now they might still be retards but at least what they are saying is true.  <br>
<br>
And also about what constipator is saying...I struggle to find time for computer games as it is...I have no idea how I could afford to just spend hours and hours teaching some random guy how to play.  No one taught me how to play, I was self taught.  And actually, it was getting owned by Tuna and Sadistical who decided to play 2 random noobs for fun that actually got me into this game.

They have to get themselves better, you're only there to answer their questions or show them in game, or even just say yo dude how you doin you need any help?<br>
<br>
For example, I was playing in a killbox one night, and this dude wouldn't quti saying "right" and "how do you move so fast?" but he never outright insulted me or called me haxor aimbotter w/e.  So eventually I told him I was zooming around by using the physics of the game to get me faster.  This guy just didn't know that you could gain speed by turning your mouse smoothly and strafing in the same direction and then jumping.  Within 20 minutes this guy was pretty damn fast.  I didn't add him to my friends list cause I didn't want to at the time, but hey he knows something now, so he might pass it on to other people and start a chain.  He will only be able to do it in low grav servers, though, since he can't bhop  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>

(Actually you all should thank Nino and Rhideon-if you don't know who they are, you should have been here when the game was alive- because without them talking to Chris M. and convincing him there would'nt even be a CAL as they had no interest in starting up a league for a dead game as I was told face to face.

I guess I am referring to the stock aspect of this game, but to me the low grav/killbox was nothing more than a mod-ish type element to begin with.

And I truly mean no offense to the hardcore killbox guys, tho I'm sure it will offend some and they will claim it takes loads of skill and what not, but to those few I say sign onto a stock server and compete if you can, if you can find anywhere to actually play that is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You are only partially right. Ive been around HL2DM since December of 04 and you are absolutely right about waiting to get in servers and about how strong the pub crowd was back then. You are also correct about the killbox scene as that is what it was back then. The modded servers were killbox servers. <br>
<br>
The thing I disagree about is the game being dead. It's not. There is a big difference between being dead and not being popular. Cause that is basically what HL2DM is now, not popular. Come on man, the game is over 4 years old. How many other deathmatch games that are over 4 years old still have anything going for it? Not many. The fact that there are people arguing in this very thread is a sign that it has more life then most deathmatch games. <br>
<br>
The falloff came from many factors. The main one is that DM is getting old. Advanced movement is the other. Only a handful of noobs these days have the attention level to work on improving their play and once they try this game out and see how far behind the curve they are, they remove it from their gamelist. It's a good reason why it was so crowded before FIOS. Plus, the game was better with all the bugs before Valve fixed them for FIOS. You could spend hours in a server just grav jumping around with a friend while waiting for more players to join before the FIOS bug fix.<br>
<br>
Look at all the other games coming out these days. They have "if you are a noob and want to stay a noob, play me" written all over it. TF2 is a prime example. Any First Person Shooter vet could enter a TF2 server and hit the top of the scoreboard the first time they ever played the game. HL2DM is a part of a dying breed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
So now is your hitreg ok on people?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its a bit like you needing to know the paremeters behind making a subsurface scatter material that mimicks the surface of a candle in 3d, so that it reflects and refracts light in the same way as real wax.<br>
You wouldnt know how, and with research you could work it out. But the chances are, if you only needed one 3d material/shader, you would progress much faster if someone who knew the topic, just told you how in the first place. Then you have something you can work with.<br>
That said, you did help me, so there's no problem. Im very glad there are members of the community out there who are able to point people like me in the correct direction. I guess thats the purpose of this forum <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
And yes after a bit of research it is now fine. Ty again</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

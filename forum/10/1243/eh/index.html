Valve has every right to moderate their forums as they see fit.  But to join this forum in what seemed to me to be an attempt to shame the community et al, well that's a glaring example of hubris.<br>
<br>
I hope that example was an individual choice rather than a representation of the corporate culture at Valve.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">any post about a ban, about a thread being locked, will be banned,  They are simply following the rules set forth on the steam forums.  Yes tf2 forums are worse but when 10 new post go up every 5 seconds it's hard to contain.  <br>
<br>
In fact we are lucky that they haven't locked deleted any thread with the U's address because thats against the rules sorta</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

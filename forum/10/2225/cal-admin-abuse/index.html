	<div class="content">You guys probably already heard, or if not you know now that Ace got suspended from CAL 1v1, only for not showing a screenshot of his match against hertz, and he was enver even asked for the screenshot... He got banned Thursday night by Fearsome, just before the playoff matches were set up. So now he won't be able to play in the playoff, for not having a screenshot that he was never asked for. Anyone that is against that and want Fearsome's admin taken out, plz post it here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

(12:03:35 PM) aParadox_Unplugged: look if fear wanted to ban him<br>
(12:03:51 PM) aParadox_Unplugged: over a personal issue<br>
(12:03:56 PM) WT: no need to apologize onti<br>
(12:04:04 PM) aParadox_Unplugged: he would have done it along time ago<br>
(12:04:39 PM) WT: and if you think ko is going to agree with banning without good reason<br>
(12:04:49 PM) aParadox_Unplugged: yea thats true<br>
(12:04:50 PM) WT: thats crazy talk<br>
(12:04:51 PM) punk: yeah thats the part I really cant belive<br>

(12:05:40 PM) Seagull: ko is a lot harsher on rules than fear rofl<br>
(12:05:59 PM) Seagull: but not in this case<br>

	<div class="content">Confused there is a whole other thread in League talk about this and that got locked.<br>
<br>
This is the last thing I am going to say about this.  If Fearsome and ko-tau want to elaborate its up to them.<br>
<br>
Its a bigger issue than missing a screenshot and it has nothing to do with Ace's and Fearsome's anomosity toward each other.  A lot of people say shit about the admins, Fearsome in particular. If this was simply a case of shit talking an admin, Ace and a few other people would have been suspended a long time ago.<br>
<br>
I know the suspension says "missing a screen shot" but it might be that there is a list of available reasons for banning and there is no room for elaboration. <br>
<br>
Ace knows what he did and he should have known better.  He crossed the line.<br>
<br>
 Please stop the conjecture and and insinuation. We may not always agree with Fearsome but he does more for this game than just about anyone.  Trying to get him removed as an admin won't work because the evidence shows that there was a very valid reason to suspend Ace.  He isn't  banned forever and can play next season.<br>
<br>
WT is correct in that the details may never be made public.  People are just going to have to accept that and move on.  Seriously don't we all have better things to do?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My real Identity is not needed at the present time, but I am sure it will be discovered soon. This site is indeed managed well. <br>
<br>
What I can say is what I believe is the reason Ace/2Qu!ck was banned from the cal1v1.<br>
<br>
He was indeed not asked for a screenshot, but posted another kind of image in place of one. He posted a picture of LukeGT421, the one we have all seen, and it had a caption. "I love Kigha" or something of the like. It was a spray image for awhile and a couple people had it, I'm sure the majority of people reading this know what I speak of. This information could be wrong, I could be wrong about all this, but I overheard this in a teamspeak server and it seemed pretty legit. As far as unreliable rumors go, that is.<br>
<br>
Now I'm not choosing sides, but when you ban someone you do need to explain yourself, even if the information can be regarded as petty gossip. But in light of this information, Ace *HAD* to of known he would get a ban. What else could he get with luke being friends with some aforementioned CAL admins? <br>
<br>
However, this ban is very significant. No, Fearsome or any CAL admin cannot allow this behavior, you cant use CAL to "burn" someone or anything other than what CAL is meant for. But, it is the playoffs, Ace is talented, and the OB update is coming, from what I have seen/heard nobody knows exactly what it will do. It <em class="text-italics">could</em> ruin the game then perhaps there will be no more CAL for HL2DM. Ace could in fact be banned for the rest of this game. A bit far-fetched, I know, but worth mentioning.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, a lot of people know of this luke/kigha business, I myself did read Ace's post before it was deleted. I also now know that luke may even be almost a decade older than this young girl. This information is indeed disturbing, but, people are entertained by it. Anyone familiar with Dateline NBC's 'To Catch a Predator?'. Millions have found that show worth watching even though the subject matter is disgusting, in my opinion. What that all means is, Ace is certainly not alone when he finds this information about luke humorous or worth bringing to other people's attention. <br>
<br>
We did get the point, he did go a bit far in using CAL to further antagonize luke and $W. I'm pretty sure that's what his intention was when he did it. Again, I could be wrong about all of this, regardless the air must be cleared. Admins do need to justify their actions - epically when it could affect the 1v1 league's outcome. According to the American press, people have the right to know everything about everyone, yeah I know Ace is Canadian blah blah w/e, but the fact is privacy is a courtesy - NOT a right - 'privacy' is not defined in the constitution mind you. What that means is, Ace has every right to express himself, even if it is at the expense of someone else's private life. <br>
<br>
He should NOT have used CAL as a median for this expression. But banning him is a bit severe for something so simple. It pushes peoples buttons, sure, but suspend him for NEXT CAL season or something. Why ruin this season for a subject so petty?<br>
<br>
"Ruin" may be too strong of a word, but Ace is a good player, fun to watch. Hmmm, so much for not choosing sides, eh? Okay, I may be horribly wrong about all this since my sources are not reliable, but its my best guess. We do need to know the truth, even if it is absurd or silly. Ban someone from a server with out a reason, fine. Ban them from a league? Where it has a much larger impact? Yeah, a reason would be nice for those of us not directly involved.<br>
<br>
Anyone who can confirm or deny this story, I strongly urge you to respond to this ASAP. I want to hear the truth, not help spread false rumors. My apologies if I have done so.<br>
<br>
I am a strong advocate for the freedom of the press, an all that good stuff. Perhaps that’s why these events do not sit well with me. What do you all think?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i dont think its TNG, if it is he's out of EE.  btw spiffy, you're lucky pike is not an EE/EWR member because you would have a lot of fucking ppl banging at your door.  and i would be at the front of the line, and if you got by me, you would have to try and get by rico, josey, frank, bot, joey, etc.  needless to say, you wouldnt make it very far.  omfg, god for bid, if this was an EE/EWR member.................<br>
<br>
edit: i prolly should have stopped that list at rico and josey.  LOLx1000000, you would NEVER get by them.  unless you had an RPG.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I got killed during pub play by a cleverly placed slam on a ladder.  I went afk after I was killed for calls from nature.<br>
<br>
When i came back I saw another slam had been placed where I had just died ( via death view ).  So wouldn't you know it.  The ladder respawn bug placed me right back to get killed again.  Dunno if spawn protection would have saved me, but that was before they added that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Heh seeing someone running around bent over with a shotgun barrel sticking out of their ass, killing someone every time their butt coughs, is funny stuff. No actual effect on the game either, though ya, it does make it a bit harder to take the match seriously.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

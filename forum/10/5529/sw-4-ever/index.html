Someone has way to much time on their hands.  I feel bad for whoever spent the time doing this.  Get a  job, a girl, go take a shit, do something.  <br>
<br>
Such a huge troll effort on a dead game with players who hardly even touch it anymore is extremely pathetic.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps this site is old news, but I just got a link sent to me by mLIQUID.<br>

You guys are going to love r6 then.  it has 8 ar2's and 44 orbs, plus 584 new props, and more barrels, even more barrels.  The glass in the charger room will be made of pudding, and I put more fins in the vent.  The whole vent is just a series of fins.  The mags are completely gone, no shotguns, more barrels, and HDR is back!  Also, there are 2 super chargers in the showers.  We'll just test it ourselves, and after practicing it, we'll release it for league play about 3 days before it's to be played.  LOLOLOL!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
but seriously someone does have way too much time on their hands.........<br>

Both CS and CSS are similar in that way. You need to have played the game extensively to see what the intricacies are, in the same way looking at a swiss watch would be benign and unremarkable for anyone with an untrained eye so would be CS.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You think the mechanics of a swiss watch are boring? Ugh.... seriously the time honored art of precision watch making is one of the most skilled arts on earth.<br>
<br>
But w/e I concede I'm one of the only people in my college that speculate on the reasons why Hegel was so prescriptive on familial relations in regard to marriage, which is none other then producing a strong sentiment of consistent child education in Germany which in turn induces strong nationalism.<br>

	<div class="content">ya, all this shit......the cell phone you're talking on does the same thing, now give me that watch so i can put an imprint of it in your forhead.  <br>
<br>
John Milton: Vanity, definitely my favorite sin.<br>

-Devil's Advocate<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A perpetual calendar indicates the day, the date, the month and the moon phases. It takes into account the length of each month and doesn't require any manual intervention. This mechanism also takes into account the leap years, but it needs to be adjusted three times in a row every 100 years. According to the Gregorian calendar, every 400 years, the leap year is cancelled for three centuries in a row and is re-established on the fourth century. For instance, in 2100, 2200, 2300 and so on, the leap year is omitted whereas in 2000, 2400, 2800 and so on, it is re-established.<br>
<br>
The eternal calendar of the Franck Muller Watchland workshops is different from any traditional perpetual calendar in that it takes into account the rule governing the Gregorian calendar stating that all century years not divisible by 400 are common years and not leap years. The eternal calendar follows a cycle of 1,000 years thanks to two additional sets of wheels:<br>
<br>
The first set of wheels, comprising a wheel of 10 years, a wheel of 100 years and a wheel of 1,000 years, allows for the display of a cycle of 1,000 years. <br>
The second set of wheels was designed for the setting, through the use of cams, of the skipping of the leap years three times in a row every 100 years and its re-establishment the fourth time. <br>
<br>
On top of the usual indications ? retrograde date at 12 o'clock, days, months, 24h day and night, normal leap year cycle ? it also indicates the time equation. The equation of time is coupled with the calendar, which means that even when the watch is not wound for many years, at the moment of its correction, the equation of time follows the calendar.<br>
<br>
On the lower side of the dial, two time zones with a 24 hour hand are placed on the left and on the right hand side of the tourbillon. It is possible to set the hour by pressing the push-pieces on the case. The push-piece on the lower right hand side sets the time zone placed on the right hand side of the tourbillon. As it was conceived for traveling eastwards, at each pressure the hand moves one hour ahead. The push-piece on the lower left hand side corresponds to the time zone placed on the left hand side of the tourbillon. As it was thought for traveling westwards, at each pressure the hand moves back one hour. Between the tourbillon and the center of the dial, the years from 0 to 999 are displayed in an aperture and the cycle can go on indefinitely.<br>
<br>
On the dial, the moon phases are displayed with the utmost precision. The mistake is of only 6.8 seconds per lunar month which represents a mistake of only one day every 1000 years, whereas in a traditional system the mistake is of one day every four years.This version incorporates a Split-seconds Chronograph in the movement beside the tourbillon. This mechanism has three column-wheels, an instantaneous 30 minutes counter; a 12 hours counter placed in a 120&amp;#deg; sector at 12 o'clock and indicated by a hand. If the chronograph hand moves for over 12 hours, at the end of the cycle it goes back to 0 and begins a new cycle. Contrary to a traditional chronograph, the mechanism of the hour counter is visible through the open-back. There is also an additional 24h time zone at 9 o'clock.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

A Patek or Vacherin Constantin or an A Longe and Sohne isnt just a "watch".

Not to mention rather rich. I admire the craftsmanship and ingenuity but that watch is an investment.<br>
I would be better off in a safe deposit box than on your wrist.<br>
Maybe an Oyster Perpetual for everday use...<br>

All artisan watches are meant for special occasions. They cant handle daily use well. They're an investment.<br>
<br>
Rolex watches are also an investment but they will NEVER loose their value. And you can use them on a daily basis.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">since most of us will be playing together against the rest of the world, i was wondering what class ppl were thinking about playing as.<br>
<br>
<br>
The four classes<br>
•Soldier: The soldier is the main fighting machine in the team. He is also able to plant explosives.<br>
•Engineer: The engineer is able to fix and repair things. This character is good for supporting roles and allows to circumvent obstactles. Additionally, he can defuse explosives.<br>
•Medic: Yeah, you probably guessed it, he can heal team mates.<br>
•Operative: This one can disguise himself and sneak around. Also he can interrogate prisoners and hack into computer systems<br>
<br>
here's a more in depth look at the classes <br>

I'm sure once the game and clans are established there will be players who specialize in a certain class much like tf2<br>

	<div class="content">Thats interesting Neo, and brings up a good point. Your character can play any class but the the way you create your characters body type will limit your movement abilities<br>
and determine the amount of damage you take. I haven't been looking at that aspect of it but now that you mentioned it and I understand that, I think I will start with a medium build and create a light build after lvl 5.<br>
<br>
I have to admit I am really looking forward to the super fast agile movement abilities of the light build but I fear the amount of damage you can take will be very low and you may spend a lot of time incapacitated waiting for a medic.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

thing that im wondering about is, before you build multiple characters, can you still switch on the fly?  what do you get when you switch if you havent built a character for that class yet?  a default character?  i know that you can build your classes in the SP and use them in the MP, so thats pretty cool.   but ya, after a while we will have to comunicate as what ppl are leaning towards as far as their primary build.  we're gonna get smoked in tournies if we all have light builds or all heavy builds.   kinda reminds me of the old NES game "ice hockey" where you had 4 players and you could have a skinny fast guy with a weak shot, a heavy slow player with a bomb of a shot, or a medium blend of the two.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

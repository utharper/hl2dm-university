This would probably violate the U.S. constitution (for those of us in the U.S.) right to privacy.<br>
Also as suggested, disconnecting any drives will stop this anyway.<br>
I agree with Pern.  I doubt this would get through the 3 firewalls I have on my network/computer.<br>

On Monday, citizens in Britain received some big news.  After months of debate, the "Digital Economy Bill" was passed with most of its controversial provisions surviving.  The bill will fund government internet monitoring and service termination of filesharers.  It also includes web takedown provisions similar to America's Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Wow amazing, if any of you guys doubted the power of interest groups, you are witnessing the brutal power of them, their funding and their powerful connections. This is absolutely disgusting and of course these provisions are obscure and vaguely worded so it wont cause too much dissent.<br>
<br>
Our provisions arent extreme as that yet Lead, but I have feeling RIAA will be using all of its powers to manipulate, coerce and intimidate our court system to get similar American provisions passed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The RIAA's plan won't fly in America. Even if Congress passes something like it into law, it will be held unconstitutional. The Due Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment requires that no one will be deprived of property without the due process of the law. The RIAA has spent years trying to make everyone understand that downloaded songs are intellectual property. So it follows that it would be unconstitutional to remove songs from your hard drive, depriving you of your property. Legitimate property or not, they can't do that kind of thing without due process of the law - namely a court order.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yea, but they'll probably drop it down to "just give us access to search HDD's for illegal copies of our property" or "Just let us look at the connection and monitor it for downloading of illegal copies of our properties." Which will look like they're cutting back and could pass =o.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
That's what i was thinking.<br>
It's interesting to see how it plays out.<br>
I still think asking the FCC to step in on this Neutrality deal is a BIG MISTAKE.<br>
I would prefer the market work and to keep the Gubbmint mitts off the Net.<br>
<br>
RIAA does have a legitimate purpose and view, but that idea is loony.<br>
Backlash is coming on that one. They have over stepped.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

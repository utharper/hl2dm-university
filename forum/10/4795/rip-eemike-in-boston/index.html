	<div class="content">We went to the hospital this morning, because Mike's pupils weren't dialating they did a Catscan on the brain. My wife spoke with the Nuerologists after that, Mike took a stroke to the left part of his brain, it swelled up that part of his brain, that swelling continued and had no where else to go but to the right side. Leaving him 99% brain dead. Due to this the family was told the best option was to take him off of life support, so that's what was done. He was pronounced dead at 1:25pm this afternoon.<br>
<br>
When wake and funeral arrangements are made, i will update.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for the many said prayers and best wishes, they all meant SO much.<br>
<br>
<br>
RIP MIKE IN BOSTON (Michael Franculli) 1/11/1972 - 2/3/2010<br>

If you can't do that, at least add it to the name. Mike was a great guy, I've been dming with him since before the Warfare Arena, always has something nice to say, and over the past few months he's gotten 10x better, he will surely be missed.<br>

This is a good idea. <br>
<br>
Rest in peace Mike. You were a significant part of this community and it was always a pleasure to play with you. You always remained positive and had something funny to say even if you were getting whooped up on... not many people in this game are like that. You will never be forgotten.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

A pesar de que nunca nos vimos en persona, sabía que eras un buen amigo y un buen jugador, muchas veces la vida es injusta y no queremos que algunas cosas pasen, pero solo Dios decide cuando debes irte a un lugar mejor, donde nunca sufrirás. Ahora estas ahí en ese bello jardin jugando con los ángeles y compartiendo con los otros que han partido de este mundo. no me queda nada mas que desearte un buen viaje y una linda estadía allá en el paraíso. todos aqui te recordaremos siempre.<br>

Death is nothing at all.<br>
I have only slipped away into the next room.<br>
I am I and you are you.<br>
Whatever we were to each other,<br>
that we still are.<br>
<br>
Call me by my old familiar name.<br>
Speak to me in the easy way<br>
which you always used.<br>
Put no difference in your tone.<br>
Wear no forced air of solemnity or sorrow.<br>
<br>
Laugh as we always laughed<br>
at the little jokes we enjoyed together.<br>
Play, smile, think of me, pray for me.<br>
Let my name be ever the household word<br>
that it always was.<br>
Let it be spoken without affect,<br>
without the trace of a shadow on it.<br>
<br>
Life means all that it ever meant.<br>
It is the same that it ever was.<br>
There is absolutely unbroken continuity.<br>
Why should I be out of mind<br>
because I am out of sight?<br>
<br>
I am waiting for you,<br>
for an interval,<br>
somewhere very near,<br>
just around the corner.<br>
<br>
All is well.<br>

RIP Mike.<br>

my deepest sympathies to your family and friends.<br>

	<div class="content">All I can say is that over the few times I played him he was always a good guy. With the best of attitudes. I would like to call him the perfect gamer. No matter what happened, he was smiling. He always respected everyone. He could withstand playing players far above his skill level without saying a word. Truly an admirable person. It's such a shame yet another of the good guys have to pass away. Mike and guys like him alone, makes struggeling with the otherwise degenerated comunities of gaming worth while. To see a person with his respect and patience makes me belivie that even the gaming comunities have hope to become civilsed one day. <br>
<br>
The loss of Mike will be noticed, not only because of the fact that he was a friend. Also because of that people like him make you belive in a better world!<br>
<br>
I can only hope that you don't have to suffer anymore Mike. That you've come to a place where you can rest.<br>

	<div class="content">{EE}Mike in Boston.   Ever since the day you joined our EE family I have loved you like a brother. One of the many things that makes EE so wonderful is that we love each other like family and would do anything for each other.  In the days since I found out that you were in the hospital I felt so helpless.  I couldnt do anything to keep you with us.  I would have given you all the blood you needed if it came to that, but it didnt.  There was nothing I could do for you, except pray.  I prayed every night for you.  God works in mysterious ways and I dont understand why he would take such an amazing person from us so early.  You're kindness and wonderful attitude is so rare these days.  All I think of is that God reconized this and wanted to welcome you into his kingdom yesterday.  Because of all the greatness you posses inside you were given the privilage of being by his side.   I want you know as you look down upon us that I and all of EE will never forget you.  You will always be part of our family, forever.  We will talk again Mike, Ill bring my mouse and keyboard and after a long hug we will get to gaming together again.  May your journey be safe and your pain be gone.  I miss you so much already.  I love you my friend.  Rest in peace.<br>
<br>
Chris Laramee<br>

Hey Chem thanks for the suggestion, I suggested that players or at the very least team captains wear the .m!b tag throughout the American CU season to honor p!ke and Mike.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What about a tribute page to him, with screenshots of in-game footage / scores playing against him or even vids?  Even photos of him (not sure how many of us have photos of him though).  Just a thought.<br>
<br>
I added RIP {EE}Mike In Boston to my server name and mentioned him in my MOTD.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

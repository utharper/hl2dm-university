Chem, I love you and all but you cannot publicly jump down someone's throat like this, it really should have been a PM between you me and blast. Well... this forum is not exactly "public" - but w/e, you get the point.  <br>
<br>
Everyone just calm the fuck down, blast knows a simple mani command that makes ALOT of pubs out there crash. He did it at least 3 times to my server back when I had gay-ass-mani. I didn't find it to annoying, it just restarts in 15 seconds and I reconnect and all the players wroth playing will as well. <br>
<br>
Only traffic I would lose would be the moron CS players who use steam to find their servers, see "Porn" in one - but don't realize that its not CS:S - download this fucking game - then come in and be all like: <br>
"wtf? where's the porn?" <br>
"what!?!?" <br>
"Why would you say have small penis?" <br>
"where is the awp?" <br>
"wtf? how did that radiator go flying!?!?!?"<br>
(disconnect by user). <br>
So ya, I wasn't missing much 'casue of blast.<br>
<br>
Blast prolly would have said he did it, and have apologized already, IF he didn't think he would get fucking crucified for it.
<blockquote><div><cite>.conflict wrote:</cite>the PM function on the U is probably the most unused</div></blockquote>
qft <br>
<br>
Next time chem, do send me a private message first. I know you did like the day you posted this but I was afk and shit, sorry, email me too if it's a 'pressing' matter. We'll speak more of this later. <br>
<br>
Also, has anyone heard blast talk? <br>
Seriously, its like Micheal Jackson w/ a west-coast "home-boy" accent. <br>
He and his friends even play this game where if one of them is zoned out or not paying attention, the other will just grab his "twig and berries" and giggle about it. After hearing this in teamspeak, I immediately asked blast out, only then to find out he was straight. <br>
<br>
"..." <br>
<br>
So yeah, straight boys be crashing servers and grabbin' weiners on the west coast.<br>
He was just jiving you Frank, blast isn't a dickhead. <br>
The pub only had like 5 people in it total. <br>
<br>
Next time, tell me to tell him to please not do it again, and he won't. <br>
Unless its grabbin' ur twig - he can't help himself there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Having run a pub server.  I can only guess about how hard it is to get a full server going now a days.  And if someone was coming in and crashing the server after all the work i put in to get it full I'd be pretty pissed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok Blas crashed the server.  He admits it and obviously isnt going to apologize because he doesnt feel bad about doing it.  Its a dick move IMO and ya If it was my server I would be pissed off and I would just ban your ass forever and be done with it.  Doesnt matter whether it was a full server or half full server, the point is you fucked with it.  On the other hand, the server is not permanently damaged and its up and running now.  Anyone who likes the server will be back.  I cant blame Chem for coming to the defense of a clan member but holy crap 3 fucking pages for this? LOL!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

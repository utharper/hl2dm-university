After thinking about it, the name given to this forum section, is almost perfect.<br>
<br>
In a caf, some people are here to eat and go, some to chat, some other just wanna start food fights or steal other peoples lunch.<br>
<br>
That's what's up here, people are free to NOT look at some people's post just like in life you can choose to avoid certain persons (its even easier to avoid on the net!) , if someone pisses you off, it's your job to either:<br>
<br>
1) get your shit together and dont let text posted by a person you dislike affect you so much.<br>
2) acknowledge that this person's post are pointless and waste your time, therefore, do yourself a favor and stop reading this guy's post.<br>
<br>
So if I had admin powers, after a second tought, It wouldn't be much different.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The Cafeteria is our home on the internet.  It's where we laugh and rage.  If this forum was completely on-topic all the time, it would quickly die from the lack of personality and I'm afraid to say that a good percentage of the people playing would fade away as well.  So applaud the Cafeteria and it's ramblings, stupidity, arguments, humor-filled and humorless posts.  It's keeping the game interesting.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok I'm looking for a game that meets these requirements:<br>
multiplayer fps for PC<br>
released in 2009/2010<br>
absolutely no classes or loadouts or gameplay impacted character customization<br>
dedicated servers are a plus<br>
<br>
The newest one I can find is UT3 and that was 2007.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i know this came out in 2008, but have you tried Crysis Wars?  which actually is called Crysis Warhead, but Wars is the MP.  i dont think this had loadouts but if it did they were minimal and you can pick up other weapons from weapon boxes much like the unreal series.  aside from that i cant think of anything else decent.  Para, do you still play this?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yea once in a while I play it but honestly the lack of decent maps has pretty much ruined the multiplayer part of it, at least the TDM part.  Power Struggle is still played quite a bit and the maps for that are generally better.   Most of the TDM maps people have made are absolute crap.  There was one guy that had made some awesome maps but his server died because of the attitude of the regular players there.  Crysis 2 will be out in 2011 and it looks like its gona be a good game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Crysis 2 looks promising , as para said I would wait for its release. They keep delaying the date but that could mean they are working hard on it to perfect it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

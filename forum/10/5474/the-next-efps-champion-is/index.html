|911|vap0rizer_: dude, you're making this seem like it's such a big deal, grow up haha<br>
Nilla Wafers: it is though.  you broke like the #1 principle of online gaming. being legit. you use a trainer. that is a cheat.  you hacked your game files and didnt earn shit.<br>
Nilla Wafers: grow up. thats good advice. try it please.<br>
|911|vap0rizer_: think you're just mad you spent ours trying to get to level 70<br>

Have you played the game?  Custom classes don't mean anything.  You prestige, you start over from scratch, and you can still own.  The game is full of bad bad players.  There is nothing hard about it.  I would like to compare it to playing on the FF server, or perhaps some other 40+ years of age clan server-  free kills.<br>
<br>
The thread is stupid, and its silly. you are correct.  witch hunt ??  You bet your ass it is.   <br>
Hacked in DII -  cool man.  <br>
<br>
Your still missing the point,  Perhaps you all are.   eFPS tourney with Money Prize.   But lets have people play that have been known to hack, or hacked in other games.  What makes you think that money wont enitce bad behavior.  <br>
Conflict and TIggy admited to trying shit b4...so have others, or at least they were caught b4 they manned up.<br>
Why let them play?  It makes no sense.  <br>
Just like it would be to trust vapor, we all knew he became god in DM overnight, claimed its from like 1 week of playing Luke, and then to find out it's ok to hack other games because it would take to long to open classes?   What if it was taking to long to get good in DM?  Do we change our name and start walling, because it saves time?  Seriously man, you disappeared for like a month (couple years ago) and came back a raping beast.  Your logic for hacking MW2 is faulty, and can easily be applied to anything you do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It definitely will, so that's why Holy and Dallas have been developing their anti-cheat.  However, the problem I have with this thread, is that you are pointing out something so silly.  He's not aimbotting or wallhacking in DM or mw2.  He just got some stupid trainer to unlock everything for him.<br>
<br>
I agree that it is stupid to get a trainer to do this.<br>
<br>
Making a thread out of it, is even more stupid though.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>whitewolf wrote:</cite>

In my mind, these are different, as they were "testing" them out.  I could see myself even doing this to figure out how to fight against it.  I see no reason not to let Conflict and Tiggy play if they want to, they're both high caliber players.<br>
<br>
And yes, you are on a witch hunt.  Get some good, solid proof someone is hacking, THEN call them out.  Not on this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Posting Silly Convo is Silly - but not stupid.  Think of it along these lines.  AWARENESS/<br>
Wouldn't you like to get the Neighborhood Newsletter so you can know if Mr. PedoBear(bahlk.jk/) moved in next door to you?<br>
Well, maybe some contestants in eFPS would like to know if anyone has a shady background/<br>
<br>
Done here .  thanks for your time.  <br>
@ blas --- tl;dr;?  go back to 1stgrade and get literate - shouldn't be an issue then.  You could read it in 20 seconds instead of 00:01:30</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im pretty sure this is a funny.<br>
<br>
I will also agree with you.  VAC does nothing for the game, nor IWnet.  <br>
only the gamer can prevent MW2 cheaters.<br>
There is a mw2 host tool out there, but I dare not risk that.  It's a simple IP sniffer, but also ties in IPs to player names so it's accessing something it shouldn't IMO.  Wireshark + windows Firewall script = cheat freegames when I get to host.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

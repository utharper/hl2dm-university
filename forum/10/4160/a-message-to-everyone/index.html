	<div class="content">Dear HL2DM community,<br>
<br>
Why did you start playing this game? Because the skill ceiling was high? Because you enjoyed the community? Because you made nice friends?<br>
<br>
As for me, it was the first reason. I liked the fact that you had to learn all those advanced techniques. I liked the aim that was involved. It was much more advanced than anything else. When I first started out, I hated people that whored the rpg and shotgun. Then I became one of them. I liked playing competitively. I enjoyed 1v1ing. I enjoyed flexing my e-penis. Now what has HL2DM become? <br>
<br>
We are all playing to win. We are doing everything we can to put down other players instead of welcoming them to our community. There's a rare couple of people where no bullshit was started on their intro thread. We are making people leave our community because we aren't being nice. HL2DM has become a game where all you have to do is aim. You have to go get RPG, learn the shotgun technique, learn bhop, and you can pwn with the rest of them. IMO, that's not a fun game. And I know, most of you already agree with me because you hate css. This game has become CSS. There's aiming, there's bitching, and there's no camaraderie. Nothing will change this game. Nobody's going to start being nice, and playing skillfully. But that's ok. This is just somewhere for me to vent at the HL2DM community. <br>
<br>
I guess what I miss the most is the skill. You guys can go play competitively, and I'll go to my pub and play for fun. <br>
<br>
This is not intended for any one sole person. It is just a message to everyone. Take it as that. <br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bad Influence</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The game's dead because it's dead. Its not gonna come back to life no matter what happens, even if poor_billy starts volunteering his time at homeless shelters and takes Zman out for a beer. Also this game isn't like CSS, unlike confused I'm actually starting to scrim real CEVO teams and the comaradie is equal/better then hl2dm at its peak moments. Also the skill level in CSS once you start playing actual good teams get ridiculous, it's like trying to put together a perfectly timed swiss watch with a bunch of nerds that sound like donald duck. Although I admit out of every 10 scrims, there's a hacker in 3 of them which is lame. Oh btw I started HL2DM because I like bunnyhopping, and still will always love HL2DM for its liberal allowance of bunnyhopping movement. Skill is subjective, skill used to be based on magnum aim when valve didnt f*** up the hitboxes and nerf the magnum, then skill turned into who could spam the best, then skill turned into camping it with an RPG, now skill is based on shotgun and whoever aims at the head best with it.<br>

<br>
Also, comparing hl2dm to css, "all you do is aim"...? You best be trolling, sir!<br>
<br>
Anyway, i agree with the part about too many shitty attitudes and epeen flexers, but youre going to find them in pubs too, just without the bite to back up their bark. And good luck in those pubs btw, not that youll need it (fish in a barrel etc).<br>

I can usually find 0-3 filled pubs. And they all suck. <br>
I miss joining a LD pub filled with great players like $W and vdus. <br>
Pubbing used to be a competition to see who could get first place.<br>
Now it seems pubs are only for people that "just want to have fun and play nice and make friends".<br>
Whenever I join a pub now there's one player who goes 54-12 and a couple more just above a 1 kdr<br>
<br>
So boring<br>
<br>
I'd rather 1v1<br>

	<div class="content">Holymoly, I fully enjoyed or scrim last night, it was entertaining, yes, lots of shotguns, lots of spam, lots of mag, lots of everything. I do play to win but I also try to have fun while doing it. I honestly think that the only reason why this game is going to hell is this community at times as well, to many assholes, not enough people just wanting to make this all work. I'm not saying I'm all good when it comes to contributing to the community either though. As far as a guides go, well shotgun = just aim for the head and strafe into it, at least thats what I think the community has said in different threads. I think really that sure they're were a lot of the things you could do discovered already, but tbh we can all try to use those things in new and unique ways to change up how maps are played.<br>
<br>
As for the community yea, were a bunch of assholes lately, all of have been. Always bitching at one another for one thing or another.  My new goal is to work on not bitching so much, accept what ever happens and just play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

maybe fun is the wrong word, or an incomplete description.  enjoyment perhaps?  after all, its never really fun getting annihilated.  but even during the most severe beatings, i still enjoy the beauty of the game itself.  the movement, the skill, the omfg did u see that moments, the wtf how did that happen moments.  the game is still a guilty pleasure for me.<br>

asshats kinda steal the limelight to be sure, but like others have said, they exist in all forms of online gaming and on the internet in general.  you won't ever be able to change that.  all you can do is contol how you interact or dont interact with the them.<br>

	<div class="content">there has always been asses in this game it just that over time they have been slowly driving away players that just want to have fun. Like I seen it allot in europe you got a highly skilled clan but they act like morons in game like it bad enough for a team to get beaten hard but then to be insulted before during and after a game would drive anyone out of this game and its a real shame because someone them that had lefted really contributed more to the game than those elites. <br>
<br>
I think people holding onto knowledge of the game is understandable mainly because I do it to, not to keep a competitive edge well yea to be honest I do but there is a reason for it. Some time back I help new comers and shared my knowledge but sadly those peeps turned out to be bad people. Its not a nice feeling spreading your knowledge for it to be used put other down in a negative way so it is why I only help out clan m8s.  <br>
<br>
I do have a idea tho may be since that the map comp is finished the uni admins could work on a utube channel project for hl2dmu with all the tutorials, frag movies and other stuff related to hl2dm. That way it more focus and all in one place for someone to really get into game and understand it better. They could even add additional content them selfs like.<br>
.film footage of keyboard and mouse for bhop<br>
.beginners guide for hl2dm settings e.g cfg, binds (also there is that Cartel | Talented trailer that not being that much use sitting on news page as a download)<br>
I guess it requires peeps to pull there weight and contribute rather than complaining the game is dead and most should know a game is only as strong as the community that supports it but lately there been little of it from player in the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's what I miss the most. Now the game has turned into what you've described it. I missed someone beating you with the mag, and you have to increase your aim. Now it's..  "Well, if I didn't get the rpg, what can I do to get it quicker."<br>

	<div class="content">It's all what you make of it, BI.  Any online game changes.  It goes from full servers and plenty of players and almost always eventually fades into the few remaining assholes who play to crush the spirits of those other few remaining assholes.  It's part of the gaming life.  It's inevitable.  <br>
The good part of the game is the relationships you make while you're here.  I started playing HL2DM because it came with HL2.  I didn't want to get back into online gaming after a few years of CS and TFC, but I gave it a shot and found some guys in clan called {EVIL EMPIRE} who made me laugh.  But it wasn't the game that kept me playing, it was the people I've met along the way.  The older EE and HE guys remember the gigantic feud that raged on throughout 2006.  We annoyed the hell out of each other's pub servers on a daily basis.  Was it aggravating?  At the time, fuck ya it was.  But the game changed and priorities changed and now we can all look back and laugh about it.  We got to know each other, respect each other, and it's all k.  The game will continue to change until it spirals down into the toilet of the internet like many great games before it.<br>
Take what you want from the game, BI.  Whether it's 1v1's, scrims, pub play, some uber modded roleplay high kill low grav gigantic circle jerk for retard babies, or just hanging out causing shenanigans with your friends that makes it fun, find what fits you and stick with it.  If there's nothing left in the game that you enjoy, and no camaraderie that keeps you playing, don't be afraid to step away and find a new hobby.  Life's too short to spend time being annoyed by a fucking video game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The good part of the game is the relationships you make while you're here.  I started playing HL2DM because it came with HL2.  I didn't want to get back into online gaming after a few years of CS and TFC, but I gave it a shot and found some guys in clan called {EVIL EMPIRE} who made me laugh.  But it wasn't the game that kept me playing, it was the people I've met along the way.  The older EE and HE guys remember the gigantic feud that raged on throughout 2006.  We annoyed the hell out of each other's pub servers on a daily basis.  </div></blockquote>

I remember that :O had a good time in EE, always had big fun with Antichrist, inozent, you( although you were a bit inactive back then :p ) and some other which i can't recall anymore, was playing with 170 ping but always had a lot of laughs <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> . Anyway for a long time those were the moments where i had the most fun in Hl2(untill now in eS). And the big EE vs HE was actually just both leaders hating each other, if i remember good I had to ban their leader as soon as he came on the server <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">.<br>
<br>
And as for flames in hl2dm, in europe there aren't much flamewars, I played pretty much every clan in europe and not really noticing ppl flaming eachother. Only flames I received lately was the match vs 911, thought they were cool guys untill that match (don't know if whole 911 acts like them or it are just these individuals being asses) Allthough i have to admit modern and me laughed our ass off at TS on their flames  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL.  Anti had some issues for sure.  Still does.  I started hanging out with EE right before Kage left and don't really know what happened, but like alot of others, I just picked a side and went with it.<br>
That walmart map was pure win.  We played the EE version of that to death.  Tons of good memories there.  The EE walmart is still my background when I start up DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Cerb, Joey and Frag are still in EE although we rarely see them.  Frag and Osiris joined back up with Anti, Emo, Shinebox and Ino when they started that USK TF2 clan.<br>
EE was soooo geographically diverse back then.  We had people from all over the globe in one clan.  You and Stef from Belgium, Ino in Denmark, seems like a dozen or so guys from the UK, Turkey, Egypt, Canada, even a kid from Japan at one time.  200 suit chargers and rpg's everwhere&gt;bad ping.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Good to see some wishful thinking out there, but who really knows how long this game will last?  The reason I started playing is because ive always been a fan of fast paced first person shooters.  I was addicted to Quake 1 during high school, didn't care as much for Q2 because of the slight rocket delay, but when Q3 came out I got really into that for a few years.  Then my computer became more and more outdated as the years passed, nothing really looked interesting to me, I was never a fan of the Unreal series because it felt like a bad copy of quake to me.  When I saw the preview for hl2dm, I ended up buying a used copy of it on craig's list the 1st week it was released, the only problem was I didn't have a computer to play it, so maybe a month passed and I gathered enough dough to buy a gaming rig.  With that said and done, I was finally playing and I have been pretty hooked ever since.  Thanks for listening to my story, this has been brought to you by: Ortho - Weed B Gone!</div>

The answer to these questions is the very point that Bad Influence is making - that people value winning a scrim more than they do the benefit of the community.

<br>
Shotgun tutorial? Point and click. It's always been one of the most powerful weapons in the game, it's just that the general public was more enticed by other things (specifically, mag skills) early on in the game, while the top players (read: me, luke, whoever) knew how the game was really meant to be played. Am I really going to go up to my possible future competition and teach them how to look at the game? It is their job to improve, not mine to teach them. If they aren't going to improve, I'm just going to continue winning each season over and over until they do improve. I can either cater to them and tell them how to improve, or I can just demolish them over and over until they figure it out - I prefer the later.<br>
<br>
This isn't detrimental to the community, go look at any game. The top players remain top because they know how to play the game and have a more realistic&amp;simpler approach to the game than other players. Eventually these top players get competition, because other players come into the game and improve until they're near/exceeding the other top players' levels. (Read: Me in TF2.)<br>

<br>
There are things I agree with and disagree with in this post. I agree completely it's not the job of the elite of the elite players to teach the community, they get there because they are dedicated, have a fire that burns brighter then the others, have more intelligence (no offense), quicker reactions and define the game as they play it. Hertz, v0z, nutri, pb, divinity all have a unique style of play that wasn't taught to them by an inner chamber of masters that taught unto them the secrets. They defined the secrets, they smashed the old secrets/techniques crumbling to the ground by themselves. The magnum WAS a superior choice early on because it had greater damage and wider hitboxes until the update. As for being what consists of a top player, it's subjective as well. Kurtz used almost exclusively used a xbow and a magnum, Helk almost exclusively used spam. Luke, and probably you are no longer top players in today's HL2DM mainly because of the new maps and the new playstyles required from it, the game has fundamentally changed and shifted while you've been gone, and as Luke's playstyle and reaction times have aged. Most importantly skill is as defined as much by the maps as they are by the individual skill. If you think PB and nutrigrain and gods of hl2dm then I think you haven't seen them play lockdown (speaking from personal experience).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This isn't detrimental to the community, go look at any game. The top players remain top because they know how to play the game and have a more realistic&amp;simpler approach to the game than other players. Eventually these top players get competition, because other players come into the game and improve until they're near/exceeding the other top players' levels. (Read: Me in TF2.)<br>
<br>
Blaming top players for being top is ridiculous. In fact, am I being trolled?</div></blockquote>

<br>
There are things I agree with and disagree with in this post. I agree completely it's not the job of the elite of the elite players to teach the community, they get there because they are dedicated, have a fire that burns brighter then the others, have more intelligence (no offense), quicker reactions and define the game as they play it. Hertz, v0z, nutri, pb, divinity all have a unique style of play that wasn't taught to them by an inner chamber of masters that taught unto them the secrets. They defined the secrets, they smashed the old secrets/techniques crumbling to the ground by themselves. The magnum WAS a superior choice early on because it had greater damage and wider hitboxes until the update. As for being what consists of a top player, it's subjective as well. Kurtz used almost exclusively used a xbow and a magnum, Helk almost exclusively used spam. Luke, and probably you are no longer top players in today's HL2DM mainly because of the new maps and the new playstyles required from it, the game has fundamentally changed and shifted while you've been gone, and as Luke's playstyle and reaction times have aged. Most importantly skill is as defined as much by the maps as they are by the individual skill. If you think PB and nutrigrain and gods of hl2dm then I think you haven't seen them play lockdown (speaking from personal experience).</div></blockquote>true i suck at maps where i can't orb bank, but i can mostly dominate anyone on r5.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Bad Influence, your post hits home for me in many ways and reflects much of my own opinion of what has happened since I started playing this game.   While I do agree with Seagull to some extent in that we cant completely coddle new players and that they need to cultivate the same passion and dedication to the game that the “l33ts” have; I disagree in that we can at least show them some things (advanced movement, grav nading, fast orbing, basic strategy) to get them up to a skill level beyond noob if they choose to practice it.<br>
<br>
I think you are right in that the community has changed.  People are more interested in comparing their e-penises than they are in keeping this game going and keeping the competition we all enjoy viable.   There have been new players that have come into the game and many have come here to get involved, and most of them get driven away by the attitudes and the drama they find here.<br>
<br>
You are correct, there is no more camaraderie; there are very few friendly rivalries.  Some people here say “If you cant handle it, don’t play”.  Well that is a self defeating attitude and it will only serve to continue this game’s and this community’s downward spiral and it may well be the final nail in the coffin.  The problem BI is that too many people here don’t give a shit about the game or the community.  They only care about their own self serving agenda and their own petty ego.<br>
<br>
 I am still here and I still love this game, but for the most part I have given up on the community because I have seen and am seeing too many good people leave it and the game, because it is rather pointless to continue to fight a losing battle.  It was a good try though,  GG.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I would like to yield the remainder of my time to my opponent, who will continue to make my argument look vastly more appealing.</div></blockquote>

So what you're essentially saying is: top players, why are you not teaching everyone? I can understand this from a very small game point of view: there's no real point to being top, and other players can get frustrated and leave (which is admittedly very very small, but in an already small game it can have a noticeable effect). I can understand this from a mediocre player's perspective: the top players should teach me how to play so we can all have more fun together. I can understand this from HL2DMU's perspective: we are here to teach others how to play the game for the growth of the game. I also understand paradox's point that we should teach others the basics so they can start having fun themselves (which is the point of why I made my bhop tutorial as well as my 1v1 tutorial).<br>
<br>
However, what I see in Holy's point is that I should teach others every single little strategy/thing I know, so I will never have an advantage again, and when I innovate and come up with new strategies, I should teach them to all other top players. Where is the competition in this? Where would the competition in strategies go? It would completely disappear. This isn't because:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>That people value winning a scrim more than they do the benefit of the community</div></blockquote>

its because, if I started teaching every other person every little strat/action I knew of, then the FUN in competing vs a possibly unknown strategy, or a new innovative way of playing, would be completely gone. Furthermore, all the other players would become dependent on my teaching - if I started to teach others how to play, they wouldn't bother to innovate, they would wait until I started to innovate and then copy me, as I would flat-out explain how I pulled my x new strategy off. This is already prevalent among the top players, but the main thing is that the players get to figure out how to counter it and/or copy it (which is a lot of fun if you've ever been there), it isn't hand-fed to them. <br>
<br>
And when someone figures out how to innovate a strategy, they get to experience rolling over all the other competition for a month or so until others figure it out. Yes, it's "bad" for the other players and can cause some to "leave" the game, but if players were going to leave the game because they weren't taught/didn't know how to do something, then they wouldn't be top anyway. Which is the reason for myself teaching very little outside of the basics when I was playing: I would let them get the right foot on the game (so they could at least have fun), but other than that, it is all up to them. If I taught too advanced techniques, they would become dependent on me explaining things, so I just rolled (mostly) everyone because at least in that regard I would incite others to learn how to improve themselves (which I am all for.) Maybe you're missing the point of the game which is competing/trying to be your best. There is no competing in the strategy-subsection of the game if I tell everyone how to play, nor can players ever reach their best - from my experience, players only reach their best if they do it themselves.<br>
<br>
Also, why was it always $W/VDuS/whoever top players always "hoarded" this knowledge?<br>
<br>
We didn't hoard it, it was completely open. We were the only ones to realize how to utilize the innovations/strategies while simultaneously having enough technical skill to make it happen. Any player who also had these characteristics would be picked up by $W or VDuS if they had a personality to go well with the rest of the team as well. (Yes, I'm basically saying that the majority of players outside $W/VDuS when I was playing were basically bad players and/or bad personalities)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Honestly my dream team was to join VDuS. By the time I grew a close bond to drag0? he already left the game.<br>
Corrosive said I had some work to do when he still played a lot, which I respected and tried to get better.<br>
By the time I was good enough for VDuS, most of the team left the game, so sadly there was no point in joining, and around that time I helped restart 911.

	<div class="content">Even though there are several things to mention on this thread and everyone has given their opinion and many opposed (but strong in some cases) arguments, I'd say I agree with the point seagull is trying to make.<br>
I always liked helping people, I did a bhop tutorial, and was for over a year an instructor here if I'm not mistaken, but what I learnt wasn't taught to me. Sure, when I was a still new dark soul told me how to fast orb for example, but I learnt everything mostly by myself.<br>
I looked at other people on spectator or asked for demos trying to learn from what other people did (you can even learn from players below your skill, since everyone's playstyle tends to be very different), I read everywhere I could to see what I could "steal" from other people (even got to analyze what people did on frag videos), and of course plenty of things I developed alone by playing. But you can't just tell every single thing you know, there is no fun on that. I know for a fact that me and dark know many ricochets and stuff not known by most players and that we haven't been able to use on matches cuz of our limited playing conditions, but we haven't told 'em neither plan to.<br>
Some people expect you to do everything for them, like it's not enough I spent my time doing a complete movement tutorial, newcomers still want me to spectate them and correct them, as hoping I would say some "magical words" that will send 'em up high to 520 velocities. Makes me wonder if it was worth it doing it =|<br>
As seagull said, people end up expecting you to teach them everything, and not innovating themselves, which limits everything among other things.<br>

But no one can argue that this knowledge of these technical skills have not been shared there has been many tutorials made by players on Bhop, grenade yo-yo and fast catch etc then there is the athletic Center its all there, the thing is these players have to look rather than having the likes of seagull point out every fact of this game to them.<br>
<br>
what's meant by hand feeding was not meaning keeping secrets from rest of the community but mostly saying is that he won't give up his free time nor should any experience player expect to. I certainly do not want to a mentor using my time to teach someone I hardly know the tools of the trade of this game I will point them in the right direction but will not hold there hand all the way thro.       <br>
<br>
I have trained guys before the same way but I noticed that I am not really teaching my style of play but more on the skill development and how to refine and improve them but the player develop there own style of play over time once they graps the fundamental skills of the game. Which I think is a good way to go about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">strat⋅e⋅gy  /ˈstrætɪdʒi/   [strat-i-jee] <br>
–noun, plural -gies<br>
1. Also, strategics. the science or art of combining and employing the means of war in planning and directing large military movements and operations. <br>
2. the use or an instance of using this science or art. <br>
3. skillful use of a stratagem: The salesperson's strategy was to seem always to agree with the customer.  <br>
4. a plan, method, or series of maneuvers or stratagems for obtaining a specific goal or result: a strategy for getting ahead in the world.  <br>
<br>
<br>
tac⋅tics  /ˈtæktɪks/ [tak-tiks]   <br>
–noun <br>
1. (usually used with a singular verb) the art or science of disposing military or naval forces for battle and maneuvering them in battle. <br>
2. (used with a plural verb) the maneuvers themselves. <br>
3. (used with a singular verb) any mode of procedure for gaining advantage or success. <br>
4. (usually used with a singular verb) Linguistics. a. the patterns in which the elements of a given level or stratum in a language may combine to form larger constructions. <br>

<br>
They are synonyms of each other, however, in military usage, a distinction is made between strategy and tactics. Strategy is the utilization, during both peace and war, of all of a nation's forces, through large-scale, long-range planning and development, to ensure security or victory. Tactics deals with the use and deployment of troops in actual combat.<br>
<br>
<br>
IMO the are both involved, and are pretty much the same thing when it comes to war (competition) itself.<br>
<br>
Holding the RPG area in LV or in Amp is both a strategy and a tactic.  The strategy is to plan to hold the rpg as much as posible thought the match, the tactic is how you go about actually doing it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The word is used differently.<br>
<br>
See the definitions?<br>
See how strategy is defined FOR BATTLE?<br>
The point is, in military/combat terms, tactics are used by soldiers and field commanders.<br>
Strategy is used by Generals planning CAMPAIGNS.<br>
<br>
Is it that all the definitions given for a word are all interchangeable?<br>
In other words, does the word mean the same thing for each instance it is used?<br>
<br>
If i lied, does it mean i told a fib AND sang a German song?<br>
<br>
Not just to be pedantic here but it is a question of language and i like it.<br>
Don't know what the **** you are talking about with the religious Bible God deal!??!<br>

wasnt any need for such a lengthy response, like i said, the part u skipped, the fact, was allready mentioned an obvious but still, should allways include the fact or using the word "therefore" is just pointless.<br>
<br>
The bible thing....well i find that wenever u argue with a religious person, they can never actually argue, they just quote the bible/shit they have remembered and think that proves a point, but u need an external source apart from the bible to prove god is real so u can say "therefore god is real and this bible verse means something", but they dont and are skipping the fact/logic part etc</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also, why was it always $W/VDuS/whoever top players always "hoarded" this knowledge?<br>
<br>
We didn't hoard it, it was completely open. We were the only ones to realize how to utilize the innovations/strategies while simultaneously having enough technical skill to make it happen. Any player who also had these characteristics would be picked up by $W or VDuS if they had a personality to go well with the rest of the team as well. (Yes, I'm basically saying that the majority of players outside $W/VDuS when I was playing were basically bad players and/or bad personalities)</div></blockquote>

Ouch, guess WRW is forever forgotten.  lol Cyn was never coming back death,  rhideon just came to the forums to say that to see if people would start going nuts about it.  Funny since Death is still saying shit about it.  Rhideon went crazy in wow and moved to the west coast.  Mertz tf2, kurtz who knows, defme l4d.  <br>
<br>
The game did pick-up a bit after [HG]Llyod made that bhopping tutorial.  Then again when WT made this site.  It helped a lot of people learn some of the better skills. Winning/losing by over 100 points isn't fun teaching people the basics by video's or jump maps was a great help to hl2dm.  Only problem is most players before hl2dm:U only stuck around for 6 months to a year.  Teams 2-3 years.  In wrw I went through about 40 players to try and keep a team going.  <a href="http://base.sta-league.org/hl2dm/ranks5.html" class="postlink">http://base.sta-league.org/hl2dm/ranks5.html</a>  <br>
<br>
That got old and I tried dods,  a lot easier to recruit players.  And get scrims with different teams,  which just takes a lot of the stress off of you as a gamer or team leader.  Bringing some of them back to try hl2dm,  the guys on my team with dead aim instantly had fun with the mag on maps like aim_arena but the movement was foreign to them.  Since most people grew up on css and not deathmatch hl2dm is a hard sell.  Quake players mainly stick to quake since it has backing and is geared to competition.  Same for UT, so hl2dm never got a great influx of players, the games was only viewed by valve as something to put on the bo in the store as "Includes Half Life 2: Deathmatch!!!"  So no support there unlike ID for Quake etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Games aren't meant to last this long.  Shit look at dods it is completely dead and was bigger then hl2dm ever was competitively.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

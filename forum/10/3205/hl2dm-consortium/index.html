	<div class="content">The vac bans don't necessarily mean Source Engine vac.  I believe beas and croniks were goofing around with a hack on the old hl1 engine.  That's why they can still play the source engine games with those bans in place.<br>
<br>
But the consortium is a highly customized package by Osiris that is (I believe) by invite only.  Or it might just be word of mouth.  I have tailored some things in my new plugin to work with his stats system.<br>
<br>
If you go to this page: <a href="http://hl2dm-consortium.tsgk.com/index.php?mode=actions&amp;game=hl2mp" class="postlink">http://hl2dm-consortium.tsgk.com/index. ... game=hl2mp</a><br>
you will see the customized actions that are currently available.  More are in the works.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've viewed this over a few days.   I duely noted that some well known players keep getting updated on it.  Like say the guy was "caught on 1-28-2009", I would check again a couple days later and it says "caught on 1-30-2009".  Now is it safe to conclude this person is continuing to hack? <br>
<br>
Or is VAC picking up hax's on his computer, yet he's not using them atm, thus not getting a ban from the game???  Is the consortium glitchy?  Whats the deal with this?  Doesn't seem to happen for everyone on that list.  I just noticed this happening to a few.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

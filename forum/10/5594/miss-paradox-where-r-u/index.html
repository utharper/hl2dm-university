Funny, who else have I heard that about before.....Oh yeah Rachkir<br>
<br>
Emo much lately? You dont play this game anymore. Who made you the hax police and WHY the fuck do you care?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
conflict locked this thread in 2010 -  I didnt have a chance to respond.<br>
<br>
Do you realize how many hours I put into the game back when I was in Khaos?  me and mLIQUID spent hours past Khaos's bedtime on the hl2dm U jumpmap server trying to learn bunny hoping and jump techniques.  So we didnt have to sprint around the khaos server like everyone else in the clan.<br>
<br>
Do you realize me and mLIQIUD spent hours 1v1-ing each other refining our aim.  <br>
<br>
Do you realize once I left Khaos and started enjoying the rest of the DM populace that my skills really took off since I wasn't playing bad pubbers anymore?<br>
<br>
I recall once upon a time Newguy told me a story.  About SW fearsome bitching about some people becoming really good in the game in a short amount of time.  I was apparently one of them.  I recall hearing this story on Lost Village.  I remember this story because it made me happy at the time.  I assume this is where you got your opinion from.  Mr. Fearsome.<br>
<br>
Anywho.  Anyone in the game that is good knows I am not that good or ever was.  I was a smart player. that is all.  I was spectated many many many times and never had any foul play called on me. not to my face anyways.  I did however get pretty fast at bhopping - especially when P!kes Fragfest was up and running - that server felt like sex. so meh - back to the kitchen with u.<br>
<br>
I remember trying out for 911 and had to play aim arena so da11as wouldn't lose.  I went like 5-30 on that match.  mustve been my leet hacks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They're useless.  People are too busy playing with their iPhones and watching XFactor to do anything.  They'll just continue to assume that our government knows best.<br>
<br>
I gave up on 'murcan democracy months ago.  In the state I live in, communities got tired of Time Warner and the few other shitty cable and DSL ISPs and decided that they'd like to have their own community based fiber ISP.  The city I live in was one of the first to start.  We got our network as well as a few other cities in the state.  The fiber networks were wanting to move out into the county and had gotten permission to do so.  <br>
A few weeks later a bill got fast-tracked through state legislature to stop all community based fiber ISPs from being implemented.  The governor of our state had the ability to stop the bill from passing, but despite thousands of phone calls and emails, she ignored the public, and allowed it to pass.  The bill actually made it illegal for a any more communities to decide that they want their own ISP.  The existing community fiber systems can stay, but they're stuck with tons of restrictions.  They aren't even allowed to advertise at all.  So yeah, I called, emailed tried to get people to step up and keep something this insidious from happening, but people ignored it.  <br>
<br>
That's when I quti.  It doesn't matter what we do anymore.  When a few lobbyists are allowed to meet behind closed doors with our leaders, deals get made regardless of how much anyone complains.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

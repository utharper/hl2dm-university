	<div class="content">Forum moderation is a lose-lose situation Holy. If I don't delete certain threads I get a barrage of PMs saying "your forums are going to shit and HL2DMU is losing reputation".<br>
<br>
If I do delete threads, I get a barrage of PMs saying "WTF over-moderation/nazi etc".<br>
<br>
It is also easy to sit and judge when you don't see everything that is going on, you check back and find a thread missing having not seen what it degraded into, or you don't get to read the numerous PMs I receive amid controversy.<br>
<br>
Up until now I have relied on judgement and respect to keep these forums directed towards the goals of the site. People asked for an off-topic and I reluctantly created one. Some have said I should revert it back, but I am willing to try to keep it clean instead doing that.<br>
<br>
I am not going to delete this thread, as it's a legitimate concern. Voice your opinion respectfully, if it goes "down in flames" it will be locked.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Someone else mentioned that to me, but you have to understand that we all knew Seagull could take it, he is also a mod and could have deleted it if he chose, and it was only one person being attacked for their own individual actions, not an entire clan based on the actions of a few. Bahlk later apologized and it did not degrade further so it was left alone.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree with holymoly about the hl2dm-u forums getting out of hand.This site/forums are dedicated to helping out,teaching,and informing the members and players of the hl2dm community.But as of recently (in the past 3 months) there has been alot of pointless topics about people complaining about pointless stuff.Even when there was a topic that wasn't made out of spite someone went and posted something offtopic or just in bad taste.The Cafeteria board isnt the /b/ board at 4chan guys.Plus ive seen certain people give the university a less than creditable reputation.No new people are going to be apart of the community forums if we have our own communtiy members being lameasses to other hl2dm players.These forums aren't the place for planned clan server raids or any kind of lameass shenanigans.WT probably doesn't<br>
enjoy having to delete/lock topics and I dont enjoy seeing people bicker over the internet.And remember everybody...its just a game.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Heavy handed, these guys would rather not moderate at all, then comb the forums for threads to delete.  It seems to me that the moderators only step in when something is in bad taste.  This site wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is without its exemplary reputaion for being a great place to learn with a community of highly skilled, open minded people.  I personally feel that the trolling and general negative atmosphere has been increasing over the past months, and has only recently started to calm down.  We as the community have to keep this place moving in a positive driection, WT and the other moderators can't do it themselvse, or else this would be the Steam forums, THEY are nazi's, this place is like a commune in comparison.  This is supposed to be a place of learning, not a place of "These people are lame because blah blah blah, or these people are noobs because, ect."  We are supposed to embrace those people who don't know as much about the game, hence it being called the hl2dm-UNIVERSITY.   <br>
<br>
Lets just all remember the whole point of this site, at least in my eyes, is to educate the hl2dm gaming community and give them a place to congregate so that the exchange of information and ideas is greatly expedited.  That is a world away from singling out people and groups whom you don't agree with, trolling, flaming, and general undesirable conduct in a learning environment.  Keep it clean peeps, bicker in pm, have more fun and don't get all butt hurt and then bring it up here.  My 2 cents.<br>
<br>
Edit: I read this over a couple hours after I posted it and I sound angry...  I'm not angry at anyone, or myself butt hurt about anything, I just really want to see this place keep growing, and its reputation is integral to that happening.  I love hl2dm and this place is the best thing it has going for it in these days of "more alluring" games, pfffft.  Frag on people!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have to totally agree with Epoch on this one.  A couple of weeks ago there was a rash of flaming and trash talking threads.  I dont know if anyone else noticed it, but the number of people I saw logged in and the number of new posts went down considerably.   Now that that has stopped, things have mostly calmed down and we have gotten back to mostly intellegent, enjoyable discussions about many things, even differing points of view on religion (a dangerous topic at best) without having it get reduced to a flame war.   We do need to remember what the DMU is about.  Unfortunately there has to be some sort of moderation and I think the moderators have done a pretty decent job so far.<br>

DMU doesn't condone illegal activities. Maybe you should have looked a little harder at those posts where we said to take it to other forums, for this isn't the place.<br>

<br>
please don't attack the university, can't you see how hard they work to make the site what it is?<br>
<br>
the moderation of hl2dm-u is firm but fair, Walking target has allowed topics to continue to their logical conclusion, allowing all parties to express their views before locking/deleting. the times where a thread has been deleted it is because there are views and opninions that are of no purpose to be read by anyone else and thus have no reason to be kept.<br>
<br>
If you feel a topic has run its course.. shout up send a pm to a moderator i'm sure they will take it on board and act accordingly.<br>
<br>
furthermore i do not believe anyone who owns/uses this site would ever do anything to jeapardise its existence...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think the moderators here are not heavy handed enough, as the whole site could lose its hosting if certain individuals keep it up.</div></blockquote>

This is not my idea of what this website and forums should support and i hereby call to remove any and all clan and personal war-threads.<br>
Steam friends is the appropriate place for this and not the U. Only reason for someone to take their collective and personal grievance up to public forums is to simply show off their wits and or get attention. <br>
If you need to show off your wits and everyone to notice you - be constructive and contribute to this community. That will make people respect you.<br>
<br>
And as for those who said the U should also cater for those who wants to know about bad clans or servers…this is an important issue that needs to be addressed. I only disagree with the WAY this is being carried out. I suggest we discuss this further and see how we do this in a more productive and adult fashion.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have a response to this, a nice respectful one at that as I'm sure he/she will read this or someone will let him/her know:<br>
<br>
To Mr. The Management,<br>
<br>
I am delighted to hear we have in some strange way helped to make your website very popular, and to be ranked #3 in the world for the search term 'aimbot protection'.  You really do owe us thanks for that.  Now, after reading your message supplied by the link above, it appears to me you are a very intelligent person who knows how to work the internet and manipulate files and whatnot.  Some may consider you a....well....a hacker, or maybe even a threat to security.  Now I personally don't care what becomes of your software, I will wish you the best of luck.  My advice to you though would be to not post such responses on your website explaining what you did to get back at those individuals who attempted to hack your site.  If I were a customer who visited your site having no idea about all this and read your comment, I would tend to wonder if it's safe purchasing your software for fear you may get in to my server and start doing nasty things - in other words, I would consider you a potential security threat and would not make the purchase.  I'm sure that's not what you're about and have no intention of doing that but to someone new to the site, it may be a different story.  Again, best of luck to you, the site and the software.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You are nothing more than an extension of the same pitiful mentality that IWU, KAT and XE demonstrate.</div></blockquote>

lol ok. Paranoid/delusional much? I am kinda bored by this trolling... but ok... *sigh* just for the record...<br>
<br>
Of course we actively censor posts. Show me a forum that doesn't and I'll show you a big pile of shit. Is there anyone out there that honestly believes unmoderated channels are superior? Read our guidelines if you haven't already :roll: <br>

Total # of people banned from HL2DMU: 1. Did we disagree with his way of thinking? Yes. We disagreed with him flaming other users and he was giving a boatload of chances to stop.<br>
<br>
You seem to have a poor grasp of what hacking is. We do not endorse hacking, in fact we look for ways to prevent it/catch it. Furthermore, bug submissions by active members of this community have resulted in exploits for HL2DM getting fixed. WTF have you done for the game? All techniques taught here at DMU are commonly known, and are acceptable in prominent leagues such as CAL and Clans United. <br>
<br>
IWU, KAT and XE have nothing to do with the administration of HL2DMU and we are not an extension of any group's mentality. <br>

This isn't dualing banjo's in the Ozarks.  There's a reason I don't click on links to other forums... its because I'm not interested.<br>
<br>
I speak my mind freely here, and have no problem with how the mods/admins handle the forum.  But for Gods sake, if anyone ever has a problem with any of my posts just PM me.  The last thing I'd ever intend to do is create more headaches for the mods/admins.  This is the fucking internet after all, of course it gets outta hand.  It's not like this forum pays the bills for the mods, I'd say they're volunteers.  Come on people, fight your own battles will ya?  Preferably in private.  Do you expect someone else on a server to swoop in and fight your battles when you're getting your ass kicked?  If you think someone is hacking and you don't like it, leave the server and report it on their forum.  If you're so l33t you get banned, make your objections on the server forum and move the fuck on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

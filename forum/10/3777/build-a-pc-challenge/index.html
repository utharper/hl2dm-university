For 5k if your friend has advanced computer building knowledge and can get good prices off of Ebay and Newegg for cooling parts and a Core i7-975 extreme processor you could afford a TRI-SLI 295 GTX setup for a little under/over 5k without alot of nice extras like epic headphones and sound card to go with his epic computer. It would rank among the worlds best PC towers for sure next to quad SLI setups... That said I'd reccommend NewGuy's suggestion with an added GTX 295, an upgraded audio card, a great LCD monitor and a Logitech G9 mouse, that=win.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Most games or software... or the OS itself, aren't even coded to use all your ressources.<br>
Games supporting DX10 aren't usually too stable when they use it. Then when you read the FAQ about how to help it they simply give you a  " Use DX9 for now <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> "<br>

If you really want to spend an entire 5k on a comp, get some crazy big HD screen and the best sound setup there is, because power wise, really, it's not worth investing past 2k unless you work for the NASA</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think "retard" is pushing it, it's more like we live in a consuming society where you must be the best (bla bla bla) and alot of people will fall for it and desperately buy anything because it's better.<br>
<br>
Most people don't want , or simply can't spend the time understanding things beyond their already established lil world so they want to hear "it's new, it's better than the other junk, it works, and if it's not working, there's warranty"<br>
<br>
Most people buy overpowered PC at quite a high price for absolutely no good reason, alot of secretarys will get dual cores etc because its the most powerful new and shiny package deal that is on sale right now... when actually she could've get a 200$ PC because all she needs is anything meeting Microsoft Office system requirement.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's not that ridiculous, but that isnt the main point I want to make. The main point I want to make is the fact that he can buy 4 1TB hds for $320.00. So having that as an excuse to spend 5k is kinda silly considering how cheap they are. Also, to me, anyone that wants to spend that kind of money on a pc is foolish. A $5000.00 pc would be worth about $2000 in 3 months and you can get parts for much less that can get you near the same power. It's just a stupid investment. If I didnt have any pc parts and was going to spend 5k, I would spend the bulk of it on the monitor. I'll never go below a 37 inch monitor again. Then I would spend around 1.5 to 2k on the pc. That would leave around 1 to 2k left over to blow elsewhere.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

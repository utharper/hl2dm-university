	<div class="content">i suggested ppl go to our forum for this but it seems in the mix of threads and posts either ppl didnt know him or feel they already posted.  im asking all of you, PLEASE, post in THIS thread a message to Mike so i can make a nice gift of some sort to bring to his wake.  take 5 minutes of your time guys.  this will mean so much to his family, to EE, to me, and to Mike.  I cant go thru all threads and posts and try to get everybody's messages.  if you havent wrote something already, take a few mins and atleast write something.  if you already posted something, take a minute and copy paste into this thread.  dont miss this opportunity to do this for mike and his family.  im taking the initative to collect them and do something with them, and then bring them to the wake, the least you guys can do is take 5-10 mins of your time.  and remember to SIGN YOUR POST, or they wont know who its from.   if their is no signature on the post i will assume you wish to remain annonamous, which is fine, but if you want your name there then sign it please.  WT. PLEASE sticky this.  and guys post asap.  when franks tells us the wake time and date i will post when i will collect these.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">{EE}Mike in Boston,<br>
Ever since the day you joined our EE family I have loved you like a brother. One of the many things that makes EE so wonderful is that we love each other like family and would do anything for each other. In the days since I found out that you were in the hospital I felt so helpless. I couldnt do anything to keep you with us. I would have given you all the blood you needed if it came to that, but it didnt. There was nothing I could do for you, except pray. I prayed every night for you. God works in mysterious ways and I dont understand why he would take such an amazing person from us so early. You're kindness and wonderful attitude is so rare these days. All I think of is that God reconized this and wanted to welcome you into his kingdom yesterday. Because of all the greatness you posses inside you were given the privilage of being by his side. I want you know as you look down upon us that I and all of EE will never forget you. You will always be part of our family, forever. We will talk again Mike, Ill bring my mouse and keyboard and after a long hug we will get to gaming together again. May your journey be safe and your pain be gone. I miss you so much already. I love you my friend. Rest in peace.<br>

	<div class="content">Mike From Boston, you've been playing within our Skul`Shock servers for an extremely long time. <br>
You've been around almost since the transformation of Shell`Shock servers into Skul`Shock servers. <br>
You were not a man of many words, but you were always eagler to play with your friends in Skul`Shock. <br>
Whether the servers were full or had just a handful of people; you were there. Even alone sometimes... waiting for someone to join you in game.<br>
You never said one distasteful word to others and played with a good spirit. Skul`Shock will always remember a fellow like you, Mike.<br>
<br>
Mike, you are and always will be missed by us in Skul`Shock<br>

It saddens me greatly to see you go. I will miss you, you were always a pleasure to play with. You always held a positive attitude where others did not, a quality I am sure many admire about you. You always made me smile with your quips and short comments... I am proud to call you a friend.<br>
<br>
Rest well,<br>

You were a well-liked and well-respected member of our little online gaming community, and I can honestly say I never heard a bad word spoken about you. I think that speaks volumes about the impression you made and the respect you earned here.<br>
<br>
RIP Mike, you will be sorely missed by so many.<br>

I never got to know you that well, and from the things people are saying about you now that you are gone, I really wish I had gotten that chance.  Everyone only has good things to say about you, and so do I.  I <em class="text-italics">DID</em> get to pub with you a few times, and you never said anything offensive and always had nothing but a good karma going.  I hope that when my time comes the people around me will have the same things to say as yours have said about you.<br>
<br>
May you rest in peace.<br>

	<div class="content">All I can say is that over the few times I played him he was always a good guy. With the best of attitudes. I would like to call him the perfect gamer. No matter what happened, he was smiling. He always respected everyone. He could withstand playing players far above his skill level without saying a word. Truly an admirable person. It's such a shame yet another of the good guys have to pass away. Mike and guys like him alone, makes struggeling with the otherwise degenerated comunities of gaming worth while. To see a person with his respect and patience makes me belivie that even the gaming comunities have hope to become civilsed one day.<br>
<br>
The loss of Mike will be noticed, not only because of the fact that he was a friend. Also because of that people like him make you belive in a better world!<br>
<br>
I can only hope that you don't have to suffer anymore Mike. That you've come to a place where you can rest.<br>

	<div class="content">I still cant believe that you are gone Mike. It seems like yesterday that I jumped into the warfare arena to play a bit with you and Frank. Ill never forget when myself and the rest of evil War Room met you and Frank. We loved you guys for your easy going nature and willingness to learn and get better. I admired Mike's wonderful and care free gaming attitude. Everyone in the HL2DM community had nothing but nice things to say about Mike. He might not have been the best player in the game but he was one of my favorites. I'll never forget Mike in my entire life and think about him everyday and wish that I could talk to him one last time. He was my teammate, clannie and most of all a good friend.<br>

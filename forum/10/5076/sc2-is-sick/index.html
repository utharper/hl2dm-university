<br>
lol you should here billy talk about strats on that shit.<br>
<br>
But regardless of the game itself,  i was speaking to the match making system it uses for you to pub.  Take 1v1 for exp.  You play 5 matches with random people and based on their skill or lack of, you are placed on a 'Ladder" in 5 different divisions.  Then your matches are picked by other players in that division as you work your way up,  Or down if you are losing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I assume you have never played a league ladder.  I.E TWL, if you are on the bottom you work your way up.  Once your rank gets to the top then you go against the best.<br>
<br>
<br>
It does not take long before you are playing people better then you.  I played some good players in my first five matches and lost all 5 placement matches.  Now i'm in the bottom division <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">  wrecked the first 3 to get to the top of that division now am playing people in the division above trying to get out.<br>
<br>
like many video games you have no chance against a top tier player in your first 10 games.  But if you work your way up through the ranks you can go much faster.  This system does this.  You can challenge anyone in a custom match and can just view the ladder ranks to add a friend.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

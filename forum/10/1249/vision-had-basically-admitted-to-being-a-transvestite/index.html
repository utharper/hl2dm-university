In this chat log.txt I have a random argument brought on to me from vision/blitz/assault/times 80 other names you know him as... he got owned hardcore and in the middle of it all he ends up admitting that he is in fact, a transvestite?... it all started out with him bitching about weapon whoring even though he picked dm_lockdown to play my friend brian and ended up losing to brian 20-0, he did nothing but complain about whoring, I asked him if he even knew what it meant to play to win, he said "I don't give a fuck" I said well check out this book some time, "Play to Win" he was like, no I don't want to... it probably only says to USE RPG!!! I was like hahahahahahahaha, but the chat log explains it all, he confesses to a lot of weird stuff that us regular people wouldn't do D: if you'd like me to upload this file please message back in reply if you think I should... so funny, you'll shit yourself laughing. - for proof of that...<br>
rUsSeLl: AHAHAHAHAHA VISION LOL, i shit myself laughing<br>

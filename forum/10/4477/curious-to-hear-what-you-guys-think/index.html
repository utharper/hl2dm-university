	<div class="content">They're probably better drivers than 95% of the police.  Hopefully, Canadian cops get better training, but around here cops can't drive for shit.  A state trooper almost drove off the road into a ditch one day chasing me down to give me a seatbelt ticket.  If someone would have been in the opposite lane he would have taken them out.<br>
I better not get started on these useless, idiot douchebags.  I hate them so much and hope they all die from gonorrhea and herpes and AIDS while on fire and being raped by gorillas.  If I was ever put in charge of the NC State Troopers I would make all of them wear shorts like Dangle from Reno 911 and shirts that said "I'M A HUGE FAGGOT PLEASE RAPE MY FACE!" year round.

They even tried to charge the suspect for the death (was thrown out of court) but America's most wanted called him "trash" "scum" but after his case was dismissed they had nothing to say.<br>

	<div class="content">poorly written article is my first thought.  the headline asks Heroes or Vigilantes, and leads you to believe a rapist was involved.  the "facts" say, a man in a nearby Pontiac Wave (that's a Chevrolet Aveo to me and you) had just tried to assault her.  "Tried"?  was there a gun?  knife?  was it sexual in nature?  a beating?  a slap of the ass?  a really bad pickup line?  was the suspect her boyfriend?  a stranger?  <br>
<br>
with the "facts" reported, i'd say they were not heroic.  they were good citizens by helping the woman out.  then they crossed over into idiocy by pursuing the suspect at dangerous speeds in residential areas.  the dispatcher for the police failed epically, and left the department wide open for liability had the chase ended tragically for anyone... directly involved or indirectly involved.  their actions were not even close to vigilantism... which btw... i generally dont have much of a problem with.<br>
<br>
as for rico, meh.  every state is different i suppose.  some state troopers/police are the elite law enforcement agencies in the state, with all the best training and equipment money can buy.  and why?  to write tickets.  ffs!  here in st louis, the troopers are generally chased out of the metro area by the local coppers.  im not a big fan in police pursuits in general.  my personal experience is that they are justified... sometimes.  but not over traffic violations or misdemeanor shoplifting.  my first pursuit involved a bank robbery with a fatal shooting.  it involved a caravan (about 15 cars and one helicopter) of 5 different police agencies over 30 miles of rural highways.  it ended with the bad guys running off the road, a shootout, both robbery suspects shot dead, and the helicopter shot down (incredibly, the rifle the robbers used actually hit the helicopter from a moving car.  the bullet pierced the bottom fuselage and hit the pilot in the leg.  he made an emergency landing in a nearby field).  lots of carnage, but justified imho.   i will say the missouri state highway patrol EVOC (emergency vehicle operation course) was hands down the best training i have ever had while i was in law enforcment.  man, that training kicked so much ass!!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

heh, pretty common after all i guess.  here we call them glorified ticket writers.  they get paid better than most local and county police.  and they have their own funding stream, coming from state highway/fuel taxes instead of general revenue.  they also have their very own retirement/pension system that is far better than all other state employees.  the water patrol is under the same state dept. (public safety) but are treated the same as other state agencies when it comes to pay/retirement.  its funny, on some of the manhunts i was involved with... the water patrolmen would come right to you, introduce themself, shake your hand, and make a point of saying "im officer so and so, with the water patrol... NOT THE HIGHWAY PATROL!  lets catch this sob!"   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

there is/was a "typical" police package from ford and chevy.  they did claim to have beefier suspension and sticky tires along with beefed up electrical system.  but no turbo's that i recall... other than what ghost dog mentioned with the "intercepter" or "pursuit" vehicles.  there was one year or two (early 90's mb?) that i recall chevy putting a vette engine in the "typical" police package impala.  they were fugly as hell but real screamers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When they get behind you on the freeway you think oshi a cop, then you hear him coming from 6 cars back and think "fuck it I gotta see this".<br>
<br>
<br>
And I agree arg the new one outperforms in everything but straight line and lasting longer than 6 years ;p</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I personally think that dm_backbone is more hl2 than most of the stock maps. It's very much in the style of hl2 and it's the same quality as the campaign. <br>

	<div class="content">I actually think the stock maps are really HL2 style if that was the deciding factor the only one that just needs to be cut is resistance that was a copy from another game and it sucked on top of being a copy. How valve let that one win blows my mind. Anyhow those maps were mostly picked just cause of their HL2 feel. That is why avalon did not win as it deviated to far from the games theme. <br>
<br>
The interesting thing is many of the maps played in CAL were actually maps submitted to the map contest had they just picked those maps I think the entire game would be very different. And we would all be playing zeta, swamplight, and avalon as the main competitive maps. Valve is a company that is terrible at picking competitive maps.  In fact now in CAL not a single one of their maps besides an altered version of lockdown is played. The contest maps only saw play to any significant degree because they were released as official maps. <br>
<br>
It would have been nice to zeta and swamplight without teams spawns in the official maps, amplitude in its current form. But over all I am happy with them not having them as official maps cause it means they can get updated and it breaks us away from the taboo of using custom maps. In alot of games people get hooked on the default maps and can never evolve past that. The default maps in many games are made by people who have no idea how far the game will progress.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I personally dont think that stock maps are given Godhood if they are called "stock" nor should they be.   There are so many very nicely done custom maps.   Many of the stock maps are totally unbalanced in terms of weapons and many of them have rather bad gameplay. <br>
<br>
I like alot of maps and many of them are among my favorites.  Many I favor for different reasons, whether it is the gameplay, the overall design, the textures or some little thing that it has that other maps dont.  I feel that each map is a different world to explore and experience.  The number and variety of maps is one of the main things that has kept my interest for so long in this game.   Many are worth visiting again and some, sadly are not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Very good point. Alot of custom maps are great. If we had more map contest's like this last one, where more skilled player's are involved in the development of the map's, more map's would be CAL/ Competition worthy. It's hard to make a map that everyone will like, because we all have different taste's.<br>
<br>
I would like to see another map contest here. I certainly would work on a new map for it. No prize is needed I think, as most mapper's just enjoy mapping regardless.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If I could decide about that:<br>
<br>
-&gt; At first I would:<br>
- remove dm_resistance and dm_underpass from the official maps. <br>
- dm_overwatch is fine as it is..<br>
- dm_powerhouse fix those lamps (oh I did that already <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> ) and there are too much SLAMs<br>
- would optimize dm_lockdown a bit, there is too much singleplayer stuff in it (like dm_lockdown_pro)<br>
- dm_runoff.. is a nice public map but those teamspawns suck - should be changed<br>
- dm_steamlab is a nice map but it needs a better weapon placement<br>
<br>
I would add dm_lostvillage to stock maps.. but a fully reworked version which looks a bit nicer.. maybe be a dm_biohazard as well but it should get a design which fits better to hl2 theme.<br>
<br>
think that's it. <br>
dm_avalon.. I played it about 2 or 3 times... think it won't fit for competitive play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I love overwatch just because so many people don't play it. It's grown on me (as st00pid says) and it's just fun for teams, and FFA. It's ok with 3 or more, and sometimes it's big for a 1 v 1 but I love it. Is it in CAL? and if not why not?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thats unfortunate, because OW is one hell of a raging battle for the top floors.<br>
It is perfect for Team play with one exception: Too many spawn points covered by the top floor.<br>
Even then, a skilled team can retake if they work together.<br>
<br>
But, of course, you know all that  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"><br>
<br>
Speaking of whoring the rocket, how about Swamplight!?!???!<br>
Sheesh!  It is like OW except exactly opposite.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

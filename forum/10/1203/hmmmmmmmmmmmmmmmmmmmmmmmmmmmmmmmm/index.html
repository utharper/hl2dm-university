	<div class="content">MEEP MEEP WARNING RANDOM AS HELL POST ALERT MEEP MEEP!!!<br>
So. I was skiing the other day, it was fun. I got thinking though about how steep the slope was and how fast i was going...it was kinda worrysome, which is odd, cause like in hl2dm i crave speed and its never enough. not like speed the drug, cause drugs are bad m'kay. never actually done speed, not my cuppa tea. i like tea though, black or mint with a drop of honey, good shit. so in hl2dm its all fastfastfast as fast as you can, and skiing is allfastfastfast but scary too, and im not constantly eeking out every last bi8t of speed, unless im on an easier run. hl2dm though if im playing easier oponents i will prolly speed up cause i stress less and am willing to try jumps i wouldnt normally, whereas skiing when it gets harder i have to work more on not screwing up and slow down a little bit. but the easier stuff i can fly on. guess its kinda similar, hm. i wonder if skiing would be different with people shooting at me as they bunnyhopped down the hill on skis. bunnyhopping on skis would be funny.i also dont take the time ingame to enjoy the scenery, cause if i do ill get my head shot off. but when im hiking or whatever i try top stop and enjoy the scenery. though in my mad self-competitiveness i usually dont stop until the summit/midpoint of hike. i wish that same self competition applied to things like schoolwork more, though i guess it probably does subconciously or whatever. I wonder if like all the coffee and ice cream i eat sometimes IS really balanced out by my exercising, like i tell myself...i wonder if i stayed off all sugar, caffiene, junk food for a while if id get freaky thin and strong. which would be cool but weird. cool cause for rock climbing i want to be as light and strong as possible, but weird cause like at 190 im already skinny as hell. six foot two. doesnt seem possible, guess ive got big bones. there was a south park episode or some shit where cartman was yelling about how he wasnt fat he was just big boned. funny at the time, now wondering if you can be "big boned". I should really return my library books. i wonder why it is it seems like too much work and pointless to go like 3 blocks to return library books. then again its easier to just put it off until tommorow. thats some sad shit. put off until tommorow what i could do today. like a bad moral of a story.its funny: that little color chart on the right of the post box is like, all cool to hot colors, except theres always a purple that stands out on the left side of that shit.every 5th one. there are 125 font color options. do you think someone will ever use em all? think someone will ever use em all in one post? SHIT! ive got one of those clocks with birds that chirp at you above my laptop, it just went off: canada goose, 5 o clock. scared me. well i should go take a shit. and maybe think about dinner options. maybe think about dinner first...ew.<br>
To all those who could read this all the way through, that was straight from my brain to this forum, nothing in between baby. if this doesn't qualify for hl2dm based forums by all means delete. just thought it would entertain those it didn't send to insane asylums. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> <br>

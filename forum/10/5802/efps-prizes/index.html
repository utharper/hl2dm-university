	<div class="content">So I was talking to Grain:<br>
<br>
ewr^Skanky.: i forget to mention in the post that obviously the prize won't just be made out of donations - eFPS will contribute some as well. However, how much eFPS can contribute is still up for debate<br>
ewr^Skanky.: you might want to write something like that so all the stupid people will understand<br>
|911|Da1 - everythingfps.com: lol okay<br>
<br>
So my point is:<br>
<br>
I have about 30+ companies lined up to send a mass letter to about advertising on eFPS. This means that if I receive money for advertising, then the prize money wont just be made through donations but also through the advertising money, as well as the google ad money. <br>
<br>
My other point is:<br>
<br>
This site is hosting 4 tournaments for 4 games, all donations by HL2:DM players will go towards the HL2:DM prize money, however all advertising money will be split four ways.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps all the stupid people understand.<br>

Yes. Looking into other game(s) (I.E. StarCraft 2) Two shoutcasters are infinitely better than only one. Usually a the combo of serious/analytical and humorous/casual go very well together.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

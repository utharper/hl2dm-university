Same here, never heard of such a thing and it never "blinds" me to the point where I can't see what's going on for any given time.<br>

	<div class="content">yeah I have heard like 3 or 4 people say this happens to them. For me when I get shot the screen only goes partially red for a split second and its only red on the side of the screen where I got shot from.<br>
I found this post from someone else who was saying the same thing, not sure if he got it fixed or not or what he did, maybe you could check with him if nothing else works.<br>

	<div class="content">I have an ATI Radeon 4870x2, so its not an old card at all, on another note, has anyone with ATI cards noticed the difference with orb quality between nvidia and ati cards? orbs rendered by the ati cards are just a normal ball shape with no fast motion effect(the dragging trail behind the orb) wheras the nvidia rendered orbs look a lot better and when shot has the dragging tail effect, i also noticed that the orbs rendered by my ati card are very translucent, making them a lot harder to see compared to orbs rendered by nvidia cards.

On the desktop (ATI 4780), the orbs do not look translucent or clear for me and when they are fast orbed I get the trail you mention.  <br>
<br>
I am however getting the same red problem with this card that I did not get with previous 2 ATI 1950s in crossfire.  I have looked at the AVIO color saturation in the ATI Catalyst Control Center and set it to 0.  I think it helped some but I will have to play the game more on that setting to be sure.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If i got onto a map with HDR lighting like lockdown_r3 the orbs look exactly the same as they do with my nvidia card, nice and bright, and a bright trail following the orb. BTW i have got the brightness quite bright atm. And turning down the brightness does not make the redness become less (haven't tried saturation)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What I did was instead of using your file (which still made the screen red) I just used an empty text file called "HudAnimations.txt" and it gets rid of the red entirely.

 First number is the amount of red, second the amount of green, third the amount of blue, and fourth how opaque it is.  it is the 4th number you wanrt to tweak i think.<br>

After messign around  I forgot to remove the file I modified earlier and went for a quick game, its surprising how much I use it for telling wen a shot hurt me without lookign at HP bar.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL, best match I was ever in.  Demos are still around somewhere.  Ran from us after I hit him with a bow, then got pinned down by all 3 of us.  Gets hit with a nade, not a regular nade, a vox nade, to the face, smg nade, a barrel, another vox nade, and multiple shotgun blasts from PB, all within 20 seconds, doesn't die, then he "crashed".

That guy raz is a complete douchebag, I was considering posting up a demo another member of LsD aimbotting just to watch the LsD clan burn in hell and force them to boot their new members making a mockery of their name. Maybe I still will but maybe LsD will take action without me exposing yet another suspicious member. Anyway, scott I really really really really hope your an alias, being 1shotgunned from halfway across the map in match where your down by 1 then watches as he does another 1shotgun to your partner across the map is completely cool and awesome. But if your not an alias GTFO you don't know what its like to play in a real competitive match where although we have and will beat people with hacks, it sucks when BS like that happens.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If a bot is considered missing 4 times with the mag and and finally getting a hs then might as well say Nutri has a better aimbot , everyone knows I haven't had a change in aim since i started playing , my mag is still horrible that's why i rely on spam , but hey its fine by me I'm just getting enjoyment out of this post. As for the air humping I only do it because I've seen good players like Seagull do it too even on normal grav , and yes just as Edge stated I do spam the shit out of the crouch button and that's why i need a new keyboard. If you think i have possibly gotten any better(which I doubt) than a month ago then look at my hours, I do play a lot specially now that I am in LsD and scrim all the time. As for some of the players saying I have 20 other vacd accounts I would like to see them trace my account and find any proof and post it on here , because I have only had 2 accounts trough out hl2dm and they are clean as can be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The time I was referring to was about a week or more ago in a killbox I was aliasing, and you got about 10 consecutive headshots on me. Maybe you just got lucky but considering I was airborne for quite a few of them I somehow doubted it was your normal skill at the time. Now you show up with screenshots of hacks and claim they are partially lifted from something Blas posted ages ago and the boxes look nothing like each other. Nice try!<br>
Like I said it makes sense now (your performance on that day) and LAME</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its not hard to bind a key to the aimbot and just aim yourself, attempting to get a kill, then instantly press your button and presto! you got yourself a headshot. Rage feature makes you less likely to get hit (somehow) and pretty much full blown headshots 24/7.

How to spot a "rate hacker",<br>
type "cl_interpolate 0" into the console, on a 33 tick server with ppl running at 33 you probly won't notice anything wrong - or diffrenet till you see a lagger - but normaly you won't see a lagger becouse with this setting on "cl_interpolate 1" it smooths out the animation.<br>
<br>
so i hear you say, "well isn't that good thing?' or "isn't that what cl_smooth did?" - it's smooths the animation but not the hitboxs, which means they have laggy hitboxes but look like they are lag free - sometimes so laggy there almost unhitable.<br>
Ever had that time you were so still and you swear that awp hit them? chances are a large few times you hit the animation, but hit in between the hitboxes.<br>
<br>
<br>
To fix rate hacking,<br>
if you are rate hacking or to help someone stop,<br>
1. type "net_graph 3" - this will give you info you need*^<br>
2. you need to up your rates, try "cl_cmdrate 33"<br>
3. and your download, try "cl_updaterate 33"<br>
(yes it is the d/l even tho it's called upload becouse it's from the server's point of view <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">)<br>
4. last "rate 4500" rate is like an over all d/l or upload cap (in bytes i think) inbuilt this would couse choke if it's not set high enough.<br>
<br>
and if you have Great connection try 66 or even 100(up your "rate" too), but your max rate will be no higher the the servers tick OR if the server is under alot of strain(meny players) OR you connection is is under strain (limted/shaped/capped/maxed out etc.)<br>
<br>
*if you get choke above 5 more often then not you'll need to drop your rates a bit try 24 or loss above 2 again drop you rates try 24<br>
<br>
I didnt realize the hitboxes could be janked like that. It essplains a lot of things.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

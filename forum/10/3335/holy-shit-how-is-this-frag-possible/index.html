	<div class="content">ive downloaded the vid a while back and when i replay the frag over and over it looks like his aim just teleports to the player and back in 0.02 seconds so fast you can't even see where he aimed at normal video playback speed, and his aim doesn't have a slow down either, just aims there and back like nothing happened, but the frag is legit because that is pretty much the best quake 3 frag vid of all time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what i see is he went into the doorway into the open area and wanted to go through said open area with one UMPH!..and upon cock back for said UMPH! he looked at the ladder he knew was there (it was on his screen as he knew it would be), and someone was on it.  So he took his controlled mouse movement and made it a sweepsnipe and POW, the ladder-climber was toast.  Look at it again.. if you know the level and your strafejumps are usually starting on that side, you'll certainly be aware of the ladder.  His shot changes direction on the target, too, which makes me think it was an alteration of a strafe-jump.. and remember FRAPS FPS =/= in-game FPS.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">it's an awesome shot, but possible with reflexes and aim.<br>
Considering many quakers use 120 fov or even more in some cases (which moviemakers later adapt to their liking for frag videos) maybe the guy was in his sight with such a wide fov.<br>
Maybe he heard him, or just turned in case he was there and shoot.<br>
Consider it's not the same watching a frag @ 30 fps than watching it live or playing back the demo itself.<br>
That's one of the things I love about quake. It is sooo good to sharpen your aim and reflexes! :&gt;</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

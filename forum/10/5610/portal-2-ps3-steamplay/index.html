Look at companies like Valve and Blizzard, they only releases games when they are finished. It worked out pretty good for them imirite?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

not sure.  go on to the playstation store tho and check there.  seems like more and more "move" games are popping up there.  i usually dont pay any attention to what they are cause i dont have it, but i know there are quite a few.  might find something to fit your needs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have not heard of any survival horror games that use the move , but I am waiting for Killzone 3, I have seen an in depth preview of the way it utilizes the move controller and it is looking very good and well polished thus far.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you think about it is a pretty Smart move by both steam and Playstation. On playstation side they increase the potential sales of the game because 1. peeps with both xbox and playstation will buy ps3 platform version and 2. Even PC players would buy ps3 version those increasing sales. In UK sony gets a nice cut of around £10 on a £40 game not bad on their part. Plus Steam benefits by increasing exposure of their service meaning more peeps with steam accounts = more sales on steam = further dominance over the PC market. Lastly the customer benefits because PC players can play against their friends that play on console and vice versa and secondly they get two of the same game on two platforms for free depending on how you look at it. PC gamer side of it would see it as paying more to have the option of the two where as console would see it as added value at no extra cost.    <br>
<br>
lastly we benefit by playing with console players and those allowing us show how much we own them  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil">.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

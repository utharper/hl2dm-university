	<div class="content">He asked me for a 1v1. I accepted and he told me to join his server. He changes the map to aim_arena_reloaded and starts the CAL config which he had changed to have a 1 second countdown, without even asking me if I was ready. I was like wow stop I'm not ready, I check the server rates and he capped me in his LAN server to a rate of 19000, cl_cmdrate 30, cl_updaterate 40 LOL. So I also decide to check sv_pure, he's changed it in the config to 0. I'm like "wow wtf? uncap the rates and change sv_pure to 2, but he just kills me and says just play you don't need your rates high and sv_pure 0 doesn't do anything. So I went along and played with him, I was in the lead so then he gets 10 people to join his server without asking me in the middle of the match and spectate causing me to lag so bad my hits aren't registering at all and I can't even speed skate properly. I tell him that it's unplayable with the lag because I'm getting like 5 loss and 40 choke and about 6 of the spectators start mocking me, so shunnyboy quicky turns on alltalk during the match so he can join in.I still beat him about 18-12 because he can't beat me. After the match I say lockdown_r3, after the map has loaded he does the same thing and starts the 1 second CAL config with sv_pure 0 and caps my rates again even though I'm saying uncap my rates you noob, and the spectators start saying rofl Deathwish Shunnyboy is a lot better than you, you can't even play without complaining. I beat him again 17-8 with terrible lag. After that match he starts saying how my strats suck and I suck at this game, so I say to shunnyboy why don't you ever want to play me In my server with sv_pure 0 and he says why would I want to play you in your shitty server mines perfectly good.<br>
<br>
That's Shunnyboy for you, don't worry I was nice and offered to train him afterwards.<br>

LoL. Cmon Deathwish. Here I'll work this equation out for you, go and download one of Seagull's Cal demos available on the main page of HL2DM, after awhile of watching it your going to realize your not that good. Then the part where I help you out is that Nutri has the ability to beat Seagull and has one of the best magnums in the world period.

And @ Nutri, pretty funny how I've beaten 2 players in ewR Anthym and Tiggy with 240 ping (sorry about that kyle/ninjins this just annoys me), yet you guys still walk around like you're the best and you're undefeatable, last time I challenged Nutri to a 1v1 he told me he doesn't 1v1 but only plays in 2v2's, load of BS. After I finish year 12 this year I'm coming to the US during early next year for a holiday and can't wait to shut your mouth (more for a holiday but will still play of course since then for the first time ever I will have very low ping on US soil).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Umm Deathwish, why did you not complain when you were winning? Also how is it that Robo_147, Freaker and everyone else that ive seen have a 1v1 with shuns not have any issues during the game? I do remember though you trying to show Ben and No_bull how rates affect our 'hit reg' by shooting at them and missing thinking you've proved your point but then realising we were in a BestGN server and went all quite trying to defend yourself by saying "i was wondering why my bunnyhopping is better".<br>
<br>
Look i'll make something clear, i know in the past we've had beef between each other over the same issue (you accusing me of having my rates set to an abnormal setting or something like that because your mininades and nades were not killing me although they were hitting me "right on the forehead") but thats not why i've responded to this post. The reason why i responded is because you are doing this to everyone that i talk to that have had a 1v1 with you and i even hear you complaining sometimes in FFA servers.<br>
<br>
I know you hate me but you need to have abit more respect to the hl2dm community and do what your clan leader told you to do "SHUT THE FUCK UP"</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
All your examples are tdm. I shouldnt need to go over why the mag is alot stronger in tdm than it is 1v1 (killbox shaped maps aside). Anyway if youve got a <strong class="text-strong">non aim arena 1v1 league match</strong> demo where the mag was the decisive weapon, lets see it!<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>ninojman wrote:</cite>It seems Ko is only talking about his own mag.  I know it's just opinions but this is the pessimistic attitude that ko has about hl2dm.  This is the same line of thinking dirk had, and what drove him nuts.</div></blockquote>
Im not pessimistic about the game (lack of bugfixes and updates aside)- and it certainly doesnt bother me that the most aimbot friendly weapon doesnt dominate 1v1s- i just have a realistic outlook on the current weapon balance. Explosives take minimal aim to use effectively, juggle and deafen the opponent, dont require los to deal damage and are bugged to do double damage to armor. Combine that with sources sloppy hit reg and none of the aim weapons are ever going to match spam on a map that isnt wide open or long range with minimal or no cover.<br>
<br>
I recall just before fios there were people going on about who had the best mag or whatever, and we can all look back and see exactly how far those mag skills got them. The players who knew when and where to use what got to lan for prizes and cash; the leet mag randoms just got free copies of hl2dm. And if fios2 happened a week from now, the situation wouldnt be any different at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
i remember stinky telling me how he 1v1'd some euro on the guys server and he complained that stinky lagged to much and couldn't get hits on him, then they 1v1'd on stinky's server and the guy complained he was lagging too much to be able to get any hits.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

In my experience, I never had a problem at all killing a lagged player. If he had 200 ping it was for me as if he had 50. I'm talking about the cases where they guy looks fluent, which @ that ping with a proper connection and server should be like. If the guy is warping all over the place well yeah, it would be a pain in the ass.<br>
On the other hand, I recall mag registration being relative. Like some times I would hit and kill, and others I would just keep hitting without nothing happening (remember 2 mags in a row with blood against jelly fox @ over 300 ping, nothing. And 4 in a row against ....balhk iirc for a cal match looong ago, and he killed me, among other stuff).<br>
But I have felt in some cases that some lagged enemies hit more than I was used to get on a normal low ping game. I dunno if that's cuz 99% people here suck and I was just not used to skilled players (trust me, level was and is still pretty low in south america with some exceptions that come to my mind but whatever.) or it was the lag compensation playing dirty on me ;P<br>
Now on the explosions issue, cuz I've heard a lot a people whinning about lagged players just flying and not dying, it is actually way worse, cuz you move from the place the explosion is gonna be, but the info doesn't reach on time to the server, so you end up biting the whole thing in a horrible way. I recall a top american player whose name I won't mention cuz there is no need to do so, firing a rocket at me, an smg nade, another rocket, a mag shot, and finally killing me on the 3rd rocket and saying "lmfao!" as too say I didn't freaking die cuz of lag (cuz he loves whinning about that, trust me).<br>
I checked the demo cuz it made me a bit mad, he missed the first rocket, got the smg nade on me, I grabbed the 2 healthpacks on the box with a ladder in lostvillage to get 100 hp back again, missed again the 2nd rocket, got the mag on me dropping me to 25, and finished me with the other rpg.

Nothing wrong with my aim, but people lagging around and the shit reg on dm is much harder to get on with than lagging yourself. You still land the shot where you shot it, then it's up for the server to decide if it's a hit or not.

After I finish year 12 this year I'm coming to the US during early next year for a holiday and can't wait to shut your mouth (more for a holiday but will still play of course since then for the first time ever I will have very low ping on US soil).</div></blockquote>

I wasn't in ewR when I played you. I was in flas then vdus the times we played.<br>

Therefore you beating me like once or twice isn't a really good claim to say you're better than ewR.<br>

LOL He didn't say that either! You were saying your better then most of ewR. (YOU) were saying this about (YOURSELF).<br>
Haha... you keep claiming you can woop this person and that persons ass in 1v1's. That's what he was talking about, with saying that the last 5 matches or whatever against you were 1v1's that he won.

It's pretty niave to think egoism is relegated to HL2DM. I was part of the epic TFC (Predecessor to TF2), CSS and Quake 3 Arena gaming and competitive scenes. Egoism was just as strong if not more strong in these games. Yes here people are pretty damn immature and egoists mainly because this primarily an individual based game in contrast to TF2. In TFC the flame wars were way more ridiculous then what goes on here, but I noticed TF2 nerfed down individual play and skill and focuses on teamplay which would explain why TF2 has a more respectful scene ATM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

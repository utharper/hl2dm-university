<br>
This was never my intent and my mouth (or fingers) sometimes gets the better of me.<br>
I am not a Hun or Militia wacko.<br>
BUT, i have come across badly many times, heated, and angry.<br>
This is not who i am all the time and i will now refrain from any political or religious discussions.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Political and religious arguments are usually pointless because they are based more on emotion than reason.   It is often the case that no amount of "proof" can change someone's mind. The more partisan someone is, the truer this becomes.  Personally, I am libertarian and agnostic.  My personal philosophy is that I will never try to undermine someone's faith. For one thing, religious belief may serve a useful purpose even if it is false (not saying it IS false, just IF it were false).   Having a specific belief system as a foundation may allow someone to lead a happier, more productive life than someone who becomes paralyzed from constantly staring into the nihilistic abyss.  On politics - politics is basically the art of getting someone else to pay for stuff you want.   The key to US politics is to realize that the fundamental division is not democrat/republican; it's elite/"the people".</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

True enough, but I like these conversation because they tell alot about both parties through the conversation as the subject itself brings the very root of the other person.<br>
Convincing others is mainly egoist, if you believe in something, then so be it, if you need the whole world to believe what you believe to feel secure, well maybe one should have a second tought about these beliefs or his/her own integrity. As much as it divides, it brings people together aswell, quite interesting methinks</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Honestly though some of the debates we had were alot of fun even if I got heated to the point of hurling personal obscenities about your character to the point of questioning your judgement of you procreating and having children. w/e though, if you think this will make you a better man then run with it is all I can say though...It is stupid in hindsight to get involved in manufactured mass consumed divisions created by the media and elite politicians serving merely to distract.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

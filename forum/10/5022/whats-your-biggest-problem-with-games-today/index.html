	<div class="content">I think most of us if not all of us agree skill in games have been seriously dumbed down. But i would like to hear what you think is the biggest problem. I think the fact that there is no longer a vertical game and there aren't a variety to weapons that do different things in most games.<br>

	<div class="content">Really depends on the game.   BFBC2 can have a vertical component in certain maps with Helis and the UAV also some maps have hills that are great for snipers.  Vehicles are weapons as well because you can run people over if your lucky/good enough.   Also there are a lot of different weapons across 4 classes to play.<br>
<br>
I think the biggest problem which probably isnt going to go away is the fact that, for the most part, games are made for the console and ported to the PC.  By definition, the controls are dumbed down due to the lower number of buttons on a console controller as well as the graphics not being what they could be if make for the PC. Since consoles outsell PC in almost everything, this isnt going to change.  That said, smart developers that still care about the PC market *cough* will go the extra step in coding the PC version for the PC to allow for better choice and versatility in controls for the keyboard.<br>
<br>
  I think games are becoming more limited because of the limitations in the console hardware and because teamwork/coop is the "in" thing now.  Many of the games out now seem to be geared more toward team based strategy.   Some are still just run and gun.  I have heard people compare BFBC2 to MW2 in those terms.  MW2 really is about running around the map shooting people whereas BFBC2 requires more team/squad coordination and planning to win.   I havent played MW2 but if its anything like MW then I can agree with that analysis.  <br>
<br>
I agree that the emphasis on individual skill is somewhat less.  However, people that are naturally good at games still do better than others.  I really doubt you are going to see a pure deathmatch game that relys mostly on individual skill and less on teamwork.   I think this is partly because the attraction to online multiplayer for many is the fact that you are playing online in a team with other people.   I dont see the greater emphasis on teamwork and coordination entirely as being "dumbed down".  Teamwork and coordination in a team is still a skill.  Its just a different kind of skill.  Teams that have good teamwork and coordination will roll everyone else.  The different classes in many games now allows everyone to find something they are good at and even the more average player can contribute to their team even if they arent the L33ts of the L33ts.  <br>
<br>
Lets face it, the purely L33t competative player makes up about 1% of the gaming population  so games developers have to make games that are going to be fun to play by average gamers.  If they make them for only 1% of the overall market, they arent going to make money.  Wish I could find it again but I listened to an interview with a guy from CEVO I and he pretty much said the same thing. However he did add that game makers can put in things that will allow the game to be easilty used for competative leagues so that tha segment of the market gets a little something as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">In the past some games really tried to take it to another level. Tribes comes to mind especially tribes 2. The problem was each of these games had several things wrong with it and the combination of them ruined the game. Unfortunately I think that the game devs decided that the thing we wanted was what ruined the game rather than the other things wrong with it. Usually they came to the conclusion that complicated games are a big no no, and the best way to do things is to dumb it down. What they did not figure out is that you can make a complicated game easier by simply not leaving an assload of bugs and exploits in it. Also crashes do not help. <br>
<br>
I think exploitation or soft cheating is the biggest problem in games today. Poor coding and poor solutions to perceived problems lead to abuse. Some examples. Tribes 2 shrike the devs felt that this fighter jet was to powerful and preventing any other vehicle from getting anywhere in the map they decided the solution was to limit how fast it could turn. Their blind stupidity led them to code it so that the game would reduce your sensitivity. Solution players just wrote scripts to detect they went into a strike and raise their sensitivity back up. I have heard a tank in one of these realism games has the same exploit. The proper solution is to make an absolute limit on how fast the shrike or turret or anything can pitch and yaw. No matter how fast your sensitivity you cannot get past that. Another example is HL bunny hopping. Instead of fixing the math in the acceleration and velocity code they decided to just cull the speed after you have gone to fast. And on top of that they coded the jump so you had to jump after you touched ground which is harder to do especially with lag. So people just learned to make scripts or macros or scroll their mouse wheel to get around it. <br>
<br>
These and thousands of other exploits wreck games. The reason they do is because they turn what was just an imbalance into an exploit where only people who know how to script or find some loop hole around the code can utilize the exploit/skill and make it that much harder for noobs or casual players to use it. Then noobs start thinking it is cheating. On top of this because players are so focused on exploiting these types of bugs like bunny hopping or tweaking their configs so they have the right net settings and sensitivity scripted to weapons and jump scripts and what ever else. They really do not focus on the maps, they really do not want more interesting weapons or more vertical game play. HL2DM is a great example we are bogged down with over complicated key strokes to complete simple tasks because of poor coding and bugs. Honestly I always thought bunny hopping was stupidly complicated just to move from A to B on a map but valve some how in their extreme stupidity managed to be the first company to make it even worse. Not only do you need to go through all the key strokes and mousing as in other games you also have to hold duck. It is no wonder half the people out there want to go toward simpler flatter maps with less weapons and physics to complicate things. <br>
<br>
The other thing I hate is when companies do not give people a decent GUI and default settings to get people a proper config. Ship a game with an outlined dot xhair not a hard to see or over extravagant xhair that blocks half your screen. If you want people to change FOV or other things make it part of the GUI and ship it with the advantageous values stock. <br>
<br>
Basically I think the life of a game could be much longer and more enjoyable if Devs would take the small amount of time to just fix up the bugs and trivial shit. Because I have coded I know what goes into this. Some bugs like crashing may be difficult to pin point but most of the stuff I listed was 1 hour to fix for a Dev. Just to think in a mere hour a coder could have made a significant portion of everyones suffering go away. But instead of doing that they jumped off to the next game because that is where the money is. For this reason I do not believe they problems will ever get fixed. Because even if a game did address them and people played for a long time no more money would be generated and that company would go out of business unless they were pay to play by subscription like WOW.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I allways thought hl2dm had the right mix, not too complicated, not too simple. Like q3 cpma, its good, but its not as addictive as hl2dm's because its too simple.<br>
The only thing is i think it should be limited so u can only jump 1/1ms(wateva), to stop jump spamming ie macros/script and scroll. So that only those who can, do.<br>
This doesnt bother me or anything i accept the game how it is blah blah blah. And lets face it, ppl prefer hl2dm's overbouncing to be easier/dumbed down, even though they say they dont like games dumbed down &lt;.&lt; so lots of ppl would whinge if that was the case.<br>
I wonder though if such a thing could be written into a plugin (jump limiter).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah because I want to hold a button and let the game decide what I do rather than just jump over the shit manually like I already do in dm.  Mirror's Edge is the most recent thing that's come out with good movement.  I'd like to see an FPS that takes movement waaaayy out of the box, where you gotta learn how to move before you can do jack shit or something like that.  Of course, none of this will ever happen so wtf am I talking about?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah I know that, and I dream of a game with movement as fast as hl2dm's or even moreso but the devs actually give GOOD tutorials, walkthroughs, etc on it.  And I think the biggest thing would be that the devs would SUPPORT this movement and outright say that it is essential and legitimate.<br>

A new Deathmatch brand that doesn't suck.  I think that was the idea for warsaw.  Series stuff gets old even if it worked in the past.  I.E Quake, UT<br>
<br>
Replace deathmatch for superhero,  or action hero.  We are the gamers that are looking for a game were we can run around and defend attackes with powers either fast movement or catching shit with the GGun.  Rather then realistic when you run out and get headshoted and wait to respawn.<br>

Fuck I still remember laughing my ass off in '04 playing hl2dm on dm_steamlab when this dude had model exploit on and was running around as lamar with a 357 headshotting everyone.  Everytime he ran into a room people would start screaming in the mic.  He got kicked and came back as a file cabient.  Best time in hl2dm right there.<br>

Think most of the people here play mostly FPS so thats probably why.  However since you mention it, one of the reasons I really dont play MMORPG is because they become epic time sinks that suck you into a bottomless black hole that never seems to end.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yea, it's called warsow, it's ridiculously good, and no one plays it.<br>

trolling aside,<br>
<br>
My biggest problem is that they want you to have a good time for a given amount of time. It's fast food. You dont need to learn anything anymore, theres no consequences, its candyland and happyness.<br>
<br>
Back in the days, few could say they saw and played the last levels of Robocop 3 on snes,  or Contra, or the old megamans, these things had to be MASTERED. Just like hl2dm and just like oh so many addicting games, hence me being back on diablo 2 because its tricky and stuff.<br>
<br>
I understand most consumers, because thats what we are, prefer to be able to just sit there and have fun, kind of like a movie. It's just that, slowly, we, the rest, feel that soon enough we wont have anything fun to play anymore, because our definition of FUN isnt a viable marketing option at this time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I agree, my friends think HL2DM is quote "The stupidest multi-player game out there." I asked them why, and they complained that its simply unfair that you have to "learn" how to bhop and that the guy that does know makes the game not fun. Of course these are the same kind of people who think you can become pro within playing a game a few times. They give up on it within less than an hour of gameplay, because they say its too complicated. That's how I feel most gamers are today. The gameplay we once knew as awesome fun (HL2DM, UT, Quake, etc) and fast paced has been replaced with style and slower games. The advanced players are being left out for the majority of dumb people who don't want to bother to try and learn how to play a game, but jump in, shoot people and get points. It's ridiculous. Its hard to find games that are fun anymore unless you enjoy playing single player for the story.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is the main reason most fps have been dumbed down, and are now noob friendly.  How can anyone get a streak of headsots using a controller without assisted aim?  Also, you can't really expect much replay value out of a game that provides less than 10 maps for a $60 game.  Then once they see a popularity dropoff, it's time to release the expansion!  I mean whats next for pc fps players a monthly fee just to play online?  This is one more reason hl2dm is so unique and will stay on life support for quite some time, theres always going to be new maps to play!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't get why people hate "greedy" companies. Are you not greedy? Would you work for free? The real problem is greedy players or players with low standards. If there is no money you cannot hire coders to fix bugs and update games. Coders need to feed families too. One of the big things that has killed alot of the FPS games is the fact they do last so long. After the first heavy buying streak the money dries up and half the PC gamers are pirating games or getting them free somewhere. So people who are willing to pay get more of what they like. <br>
<br>
I personally would gladly pay even as much as $10 per month if my FPS game was kept clean and bug free and a serious anticheat system was put in place that was constantly updated. But most people are not and so their appears to be no market for a company to develop this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i sadly agree. because i love FPS ... <br>
<br>
nothing greedy about trying to keep their head above water and to do so they have to come out with new titles ALL THE TIME. it's a business thing and market demand calls the shots. not the devs. many ppl seem to miss this point. if back in 02-03-04 ppl liked playing deathmatch based games then dev catered for that...but then public taste changes and ppl like playing team based, coop and shoot more zombies or w/e then companies HAVE to respond or they go under.<br>
<br>
having said that...one of the funniest lies i've heard in my life is Valve's "Episodes" scheme. i'd probably do the same in their shoes but it's still a big fat lie lol.<br>
based on the logic of "we want to bring you new games faster and don't want to keep the fans waiting for years and years for every new title.<br>
so ok..let's see now. HL1 came out Nov 98<br>
HL2 came out Nov 04 - a 5 years gap (reported as a 6 years dev cycle)<br>
ep1 came out Jun 06 - about a 1.5 yrs gap for meh...about an hour worth of playtime. in other words, less than the length of a single HL2 chapter.<br>
ep2 came out Oct 07 (bundled with TF2 and Portal!!! = 3 games) again, illegally short.<br>
it's now May 2010 and we won't be seeing ep3 anytime soon. at least not until late 11.<br>
however, in the mean time it took them TWO years to release TWO HUGE games for what's now a MAJOR franchise - L4D.<br>
mind you L4D2 took less than a year's dev cycle. in full. with SDK support (well with all the famous Valve bugs any Source SDK gotta have lol). a year. one year. not 6. not 4.<br>
<br>
so, yes, the "episodic" approach was a lie but i can't blame them. in a time where other companies went under, were liquidized, merged or bought by big corporations Valve with an outdated engine is still at the top, selling more and getting better.<br>
yes i prefer playing dm still and prefer FPS games in general but i also salute Valve for their achievements.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Actually its Activision calling the shots, directing IW what to do (Activsion is the parent/owner company having little to do with developing the game but with the marketing and sales decisions)...<br>
<br>
Speaking of Activision vs IW read here <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/28/infinity-ward-employee-group-lawsuit-documents-see-them-here/" class="postlink">http://www.joystiq.com/2010/04/28/infin ... them-here/</a><br>

This was my problem with defending such a company, they made 1.5 billion in sales but can't pay the promised royalties to the people who made their fortune possible. There's greed at its best, the developers you defend with such passion are the ones being shafted Fearsome.

Second like I said it is the consumers. If someone figures out consumers are willing to pay for 2 maps then more development will go toward those types of games. Where as with DM games like HL2DM and Quake Live people are not even willing to pay for the game at all. They have to give it away for free. So next time what game are you going to make one you have to give away or one you can charge money for?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

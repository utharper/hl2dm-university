<br>
<br>
So, there's a man crawling through the desert.<br>
<br>
He'd decided to try his SUV in a little bit of cross-country travel, had<br>
great fun zooming over the badlands and through the sand, got lost, hit a<br>
big rock, and then he couldn't get it started again. There were no cell<br>
phone towers anywhere near, so his cell phone was useless. He had no family,<br>
his parents had died a few years before in an auto accident, and his few<br>
friends had no idea he was out here.<br>
<br>
He stayed with the car for a day or so, but his one bottle of water ran out<br>
and he was getting thirsty. He thought maybe he knew the direction back, now<br>
that he'd paid attention to the sun and thought he'd figured out which way<br>
was north, so he decided to start walking. He figured he only had to go<br>
about 30 miles or so and he'd be back to the small town he'd gotten gas in<br>
last.<br>
<br>
He thinks about walking at night to avoid the heat and sun, but based upon<br>
how dark it actually was the night before, and given that he has no<br>
flashlight, he's afraid that he'll break a leg or step on a rattlesnake. So,<br>
he puts on some sun block, puts the rest in his pocket for reapplication<br>
later, brings an umbrella he'd had in the back of the SUV with him to give<br>
him a little shade, pours the windshield wiper fluid into his water bottle<br>
in case he gets that desperate, brings his pocket knife in case he finds a<br>
cactus that looks like it might have water in it, and heads out in the<br>
direction he thinks is right.<br>
<br>
He walks for the entire day. By the end of the day he's really thirsty. He's<br>
been sweating all day, and his lips are starting to crack. He's reapplied<br>
the sunblock twice, and tried to stay under the umbrella, but he still feels<br>
sunburned. The windshield wiper fluid sloshing in the bottle in his pocket<br>
is really getting tempting now. He knows that it's mainly water and some<br>
ethanol and coloring, but he also knows that they add some kind of poison to<br>
it to keep people from drinking it. He wonders what the poison is, and<br>
whether the poison would be worse than dying of thirst.<br>
<br>
He pushes on, trying to get to that small town before dark.<br>
<br>
By the end of the day he starts getting worried. He figures he's been<br>
walking at least 3 miles an hour, according to his watch for over 10 hours.<br>
That means that if his estimate was right that he should be close to the<br>
town. But he doesn't recognize any of this. He had to cross a dry creek bed<br>
a mile or two back, and he doesn't remember coming through it in the SUV. He<br>
figures that maybe he got his direction off just a little and that the dry<br>
creek bed was just off to one side of his path. He tells himself that he's<br>
close, and that after dark he'll start seeing the town lights over one of<br>
these hills, and that'll be all he needs.<br>
<br>
As it gets dim enough that he starts stumbling over small rocks and things,<br>
he finds a spot and sits down to wait for full dark and the town lights.<br>
<br>
Full dark comes before he knows it. He must have dozed off. He stands back<br>
up and turns all the way around. He sees nothing but stars.<br>
<br>
He wakes up the next morning feeling absolutely lousy. His eyes are gummy<br>
and his mouth and nose feel like they're full of sand. He so thirsty that he<br>
can't even swallow. He barely got any sleep because it was so cold. He'd<br>
forgotten how cold it got at night in the desert and hadn't noticed it the<br>
night before because he'd been in his car.<br>
<br>
He knows the Rule of Threes - three minutes without air, three days without<br>
water, three weeks without food - then you die. Some people can make it a<br>
little longer, in the best situations. But the desert heat and having to<br>
walk and sweat isn't the best situation to be without water. He figures,<br>
unless he finds water, this is his last day.<br>
<br>
He rinses his mouth out with a little of the windshield wiper fluid. He<br>
waits a while after spitting that little bit out, to see if his mouth goes<br>
numb, or he feels dizzy or something. Has his mouth gone numb? Is it just in<br>
his mind? He's not sure. He'll go a little farther, and if he still doesn't<br>
find water, he'll try drinking some of the fluid.<br>
<br>
Then he has to face his next, harder question - which way does he go from<br>
here? Does he keep walking the same way he was yesterday (assuming that he<br>
still knows which way that is), or does he try a new direction? He has no<br>
idea what to do.<br>
<br>
Looking at the hills and dunes around him, he thinks he knows the direction<br>
he was heading before. Just going by a feeling, he points himself somewhat<br>
to the left of that, and starts walking.<br>
<br>
As he walks, the day starts heating up. The desert, too cold just a couple<br>
of hours before, soon becomes an oven again. He sweats a little at first,<br>
and then stops. He starts getting worried at that - when you stop sweating<br>
he knows that means you're in trouble - usually right before heat stroke.<br>
<br>
He decides that it's time to try the windshield wiper fluid. He can't wait<br>
any longer - if he passes out, he's dead. He stops in the shade of a large<br>
rock, takes the bottle out, opens it, and takes a mouthful. He slowly<br>
swallows it, making it last as long as he can. It feels so good in his dry<br>
and cracked throat that he doesn't even care about the nasty taste. He takes<br>
another mouthful, and makes it last too. Slowly, he drinks half the bottle.<br>
He figures that since he's drinking it, he might as well drink enough to<br>
make some difference and keep himself from passing out.<br>
<br>
He's quti worrying about the denaturing of the wiper fluid. If it kills him,<br>
it kills him - if he didn't drink it, he'd die anyway. Besides, he's pretty<br>
sure that whatever substance they denature the fluid with is just designed<br>
to make you sick - their way of keeping winos from buying cheap wiper fluid<br>
for the ethanol content. He can handle throwing up, if it comes to that.<br>
<br>
He walks. He walks in the hot, dry, windless desert. Sand, rocks, hills,<br>
dunes, the occasional scrawny cactus or dried bush. No sign of water.<br>
Sometimes he'll see a little movement to one side or the other, but whatever<br>
moved is usually gone before he can focus his eyes on it. Probably birds,<br>
lizards, or mice. Maybe snakes, though they usually move more at night. He's<br>
careful to stay away from the movements.<br>
<br>
After a while, he begins to stagger. He's not sure if it's fatigue, heat<br>
stroke finally catching him, or maybe he was wrong and the denaturing of the<br>
wiper fluid was worse than he thought. He tries to steady himself, and keep<br>
going.<br>
<br>
After more walking, he comes to a large stretch of sand. This is good! He<br>
knows he passed over a stretch of sand in the SUV - he remembers doing<br>
donuts in it. Or at least he thinks he remembers it - he's getting woozy<br>
enough and tired enough that he's not sure what he remembers any more or if<br>
he's hallucinating. But he thinks he remembers it. So he heads off into it,<br>
trying to get to the other side, hoping that it gets him closer to the town.<br>
<br>
He was heading for a town, wasn't he? He thinks he was. He isn't sure any<br>
more. He's not even sure how long he's been walking any more. Is it still<br>
morning? Or has it moved into afternoon and the sun is going down again? It<br>
must be afternoon - it seems like it's been too long since he started out.<br>
<br>
He walks through the sand.<br>
<br>
After a while, he comes to a big dune in the sand. This is bad. He doesn't<br>
remember any dunes when driving over the sand in his SUV. Or at least he<br>
doesn't think he remembers any. This is bad.<br>
<br>
But, he has no other direction to go. Too late to turn back now. He figures<br>
that he'll get to the top of the dune and see if he can see anything from<br>
there that helps him find the town. He keeps going up the dune.<br>
<br>
Halfway up, he slips in the bad footing of the sand for the second or third<br>
time, and falls to his knees. He doesn't feel like getting back up - he'll<br>
just fall down again. So, he keeps going up the dune on his hand and knees.<br>
<br>
While crawling, if his throat weren't so dry, he'd laugh. He's finally<br>
gotten to the hackneyed image of a man lost in the desert - crawling through<br>
the sand on his hands and knees. If would be the perfect image, he imagines,<br>
if only his clothes were more ragged. The people crawling through the desert<br>
in the cartoons always had ragged clothes. But his have lasted without any<br>
rips so far. Somebody will probably find his dessicated corpse half buried<br>
in the sand years from now, and his clothes will still be in fine shape -<br>
shake the sand out, and a good wash, and they'd be wearable again. He wishes<br>
his throat were wet enough to laugh. He coughs a little instead, and it<br>
hurts.<br>
<br>
He finally makes it to the top of the sand dune. Now that he's at the top,<br>
he struggles a little, but manages to stand up and look around. All he sees<br>
is sand. Sand, and more sand. Behind him, about a mile away, he thinks he<br>
sees the rocky ground he left to head into this sand. Ahead of him, more<br>
dunes, more sand. This isn't where he drove his SUV. This is Hell. Or close<br>
enough.<br>
<br>
Again, he doesn't know what to do. He decides to drink the rest of the wiper<br>
fluid while figuring it out. He takes out the bottle, and is removing the<br>
cap, when he glances to the side and sees something. Something in the sand.<br>
At the bottom of the dune, off to the side, he sees something strange. It's<br>
a flat area, in the sand. He stops taking the cap of the bottle off, and<br>
tries to look closer. The area seems to be circular. And it's dark - darker<br>
than the sand. And, there seems to be something in the middle of it, but he<br>
can't tell what it is. He looks as hard as he can, and still can tell from<br>
here. He's going to have to go down there and look.<br>
<br>
He puts the bottle back in his pocket, and starts to stumble down the dune.<br>
After a few steps, he realizes that he's in trouble - he's not going to be<br>
able to keep his balance. After a couple of more sliding, tottering steps,<br>
he falls and starts to roll down the dune. The sand it so hot when his body<br>
hits it that for a minute he thinks he's caught fire on the way down - like<br>
a movie car wreck flashing into flames as it goes over the cliff, before it<br>
ever even hits the ground. He closes his eyes and mouth, covers his face<br>
with his hands, and waits to stop rolling.<br>
<br>
He stops, at the bottom of the dune. After a minute or two, he finds enough<br>
energy to try to sit up and get the sand out of his face and clothes. When<br>
he clears his eyes enough, he looks around to make sure that the dark spot<br>
in the sand it still there and he hadn't just imagined it.<br>
<br>
So, seeing the large, flat, dark spot on the sand is still there, he begins<br>
to crawl towards it. He'd get up and walk towards it, but he doesn't seem to<br>
have the energy to get up and walk right now. He must be in the final stages<br>
of dehydration he figures, as he crawls. If this place in the sand doesn't<br>
have water, he'll likely never make it anywhere else. This is his last<br>
chance.<br>
<br>
He gets closer and closer, but still can't see what's in the middle of the<br>
dark area. His eyes won't quite focus any more for some reason. And lifting<br>
his head up to look takes so much effort that he gives up trying. He just<br>
keeps crawling.<br>
<br>
Finally, he reaches the area he'd seen from the dune. It takes him a minute<br>
of crawling on it before he realizes that he's no longer on sand - he's now<br>
crawling on some kind of dark stone. Stone with some kind of marking on it -<br>
a pattern cut into the stone. He's too tired to stand up and try to see what<br>
the pattern is - so he just keeps crawling. He crawls towards the center,<br>
where his blurry eyes still see something in the middle of the dark stone<br>
area.<br>
<br>
His mind, detached in a strange way, notes that either his hands and knees<br>
are so burnt by the sand that they no longer feel pain, or that this dark<br>
stone, in the middle of a burning desert with a pounding, punishing sun<br>
overhead, doesn't seem to be hot. It almost feels cool. He considers lying<br>
down on the nice cool surface.<br>
<br>
Cool, dark stone. Not a good sign. He must be hallucinating this. He's<br>
probably in the middle of a patch of sand, already lying face down and<br>
dying, and just imagining this whole thing. A desert mirage. Soon the<br>
beautiful women carrying pitchers of water will come up and start giving him<br>
a drink. Then he'll know he's gone.<br>
<br>
He decides against laying down on the cool stone. If he's going to die here<br>
in the middle of this hallucination, he at least wants to see what's in the<br>
center before he goes. He keeps crawling.<br>
<br>
It's the third time that he hears the voice before he realizes what he's<br>
hearing. He would swear that someone just said, "Greetings, traveler. You do<br>
not look well. Do you hear me?"<br>
<br>
He stops crawling. He tries to look up from where he is on his hands and<br>
knees, but it's too much effort to lift his head. So he tries something<br>
different - he leans back and tries to sit up on the stone. After a few<br>
seconds, he catches his balance, avoids falling on his face, sits up, and<br>
tries to focus his eyes. Blurry. He rubs his eyes with the back of his hands<br>
and tries again. Better this time.<br>
<br>
Yep. He can see. He's sitting in the middle of a large, flat, dark expanse<br>
of stone. Directly next to him, about three feet away, is a white post or<br>
pole about two inches in diameter and sticking up about four or five feet<br>
out of the stone, at an angle.<br>
<br>
And wrapped around this white rod, tail with rattle on it hovering and<br>
seeming to be ready to start rattling, is what must be a fifteen foot long<br>
desert diamondback rattlesnake, looking directly at him.<br>
<br>
He stares at the snake in shock. He doesn't have the energy to get up and<br>
run away. He doesn't even have the energy to crawl away. This is it, his<br>
final resting place. No matter what happens, he's not going to be able to<br>
move from this spot.<br>
<br>
Well, at least dying of a bite from this monster should be quicker than<br>
dying of thirst. He'll face his end like a man. He struggles to sit up a<br>
little straighter. The snake keeps watching him. He lifts one hand and waves<br>
it in the snake's direction, feebly. The snake watches the hand for a<br>
moment, then goes back to watching the man, looking into his eyes.<br>
<br>
Hmmm. Maybe the snake had no interest in biting him? It hadn't rattled yet -<br>
that was a good sign. Maybe he wasn't going to die of snake bite after all.<br>
<br>
He then remembers that he'd looked up when he'd reached the center here<br>
because he thought he'd heard a voice. He was still very woozy - he was<br>
likely to pass out soon, the sun still beat down on him even though he was<br>
now on cool stone. He still didn't have anything to drink. But maybe he had<br>
actually heard a voice. This stone didn't look natural. Nor did that white<br>
post sticking up out of the stone. Someone had to have built this. Maybe<br>
they were still nearby. Maybe that was who talked to him. Maybe this snake<br>
was even their pet, and that's why it wasn't biting.<br>
<br>
He tries to clear his throat to say, "Hello," but his throat is too dry. All<br>
that comes out is a coughing or wheezing sound. There is no way he's going<br>
to be able to talk without something to drink. He feels his pocket, and the<br>
bottle with the wiper fluid is still there. He shakily pulls the bottle out,<br>
almost losing his balance and falling on his back in the process. This isn't<br>
good. He doesn't have much time left, by his reckoning, before he passes<br>
out.<br>
<br>
He gets the lid off of the bottle, manages to get the bottle to his lips,<br>
and pours some of the fluid into his mouth. He sloshes it around, and then<br>
swallows it. He coughs a little. His throat feels better. Maybe he can talk<br>
now.<br>
<br>
He tries again. Ignoring the snake, he turns to look around him, hoping to<br>
spot the owner of this place, and croaks out, "Hello? Is there anyone here?"<br>
<br>
He hears, from his side, "Greetings. What is it that you want?"<br>
<br>
He turns his head, back towards the snake. That's where the sound had seemed<br>
to come from. The only thing he can think of is that there must be a<br>
speaker, hidden under the snake, or maybe built into that post. He decides<br>
to try asking for help.<br>
<br>
"Please," he croaks again, suddenly feeling dizzy, "I'd love to not be<br>
thirsty any more. I've been a long time without water. Can you help me?"<br>
<br>
Looking in the direction of the snake, hoping to see where the voice was<br>
coming from this time, he is shocked to see the snake rear back, open its<br>
mouth, and speak. He hears it say, as the dizziness overtakes him and he<br>
falls forward, face first on the stone, "Very well. Coming up."<br>
<br>
A piercing pain shoots through his shoulder. Suddenly he is awake. He sits<br>
up and grabs his shoulder, wincing at the throbbing pain. He's momentarily<br>
disoriented as he looks around, and then he remembers - the crawl across the<br>
sand, the dark area of stone, the snake. He sees the snake, still wrapped<br>
around the tilted white post, still looking at him.<br>
<br>
He reaches up and feels his shoulder, where it hurts. It feels slightly wet.<br>
He pulls his fingers away and looks at them - blood. He feels his shoulder<br>
again - his shirt has what feels like two holes in it - two puncture holes -<br>
they match up with the two aching spots of pain on his shoulder. He had been<br>
bitten. By the snake.<br>
<br>
"It'll feel better in a minute." He looks up - it's the snake talking. He<br>
hadn't dreamed it. Suddenly he notices - he's not dizzy any more. And more<br>
importantly, he's not thirsty any more - at all!<br>
<br>
"Have I died? Is this the afterlife? Why are you biting me in the<br>
afterlife?"<br>
<br>
"Sorry about that, but I had to bite you," says the snake. "That's the way I<br>
work. It all comes through the bite. Think of it as natural medicine."<br>
<br>
"You bit me to help me? Why aren't I thirsty any more? Did you give me a<br>
drink before you bit me? How did I drink enough while unconscious to not be<br>
thirsty any more? I haven't had a drink for over two days. Well, except for<br>
the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk?<br>
Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?"<br>
<br>
"No," says the snake, "I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I<br>
didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I<br>
bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just<br>
sitting around here."<br>
<br>
The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the<br>
desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a<br>
snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not<br>
great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no<br>
longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt<br>
hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool<br>
stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer<br>
dying of thirst.<br>
<br>
"I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your<br>
system with the next request," continued the snake. "I can guess why you<br>
drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left<br>
in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or<br>
two, if you drank enough of it."<br>
<br>
"Ummm, n-next request?" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting<br>
shoulder and backed away from the snake a little.<br>
<br>
"That's the way it works. If you like, that is," explained the snake. "You<br>
get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish." The snake grinned at his<br>
own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs.<br>
<br>
"But there are rules," the snake continued. "The first request is free. The<br>
second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of<br>
responsibility." The snake looks at the man seriously.<br>
<br>
"By the way," the snake says suddenly, "my name is Nathan. Old Nathan,<br>
Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound<br>
used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand<br>
for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into<br>
names. You can call me Nate, if you wish." Again, the snake grinned. "Sorry<br>
if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds<br>
somewhat threatening." The snake give his rattle a little shake.<br>
<br>
"Umm, my name is Jack," said the man, trying to absorb all of this. "Jack<br>
Samson.<br>
<br>
"Can I ask you a question?" Jack says suddenly. "What happened to the<br>
poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that?<br>
What do you mean by that's how you work?"<br>
<br>
"That's more than one question," grins Nate. "But I'll still try to answer<br>
all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question." The snake's grin gets<br>
wider. "Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need<br>
to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not<br>
be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make<br>
it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at<br>
all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to<br>
get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert.<br>
You've been changed.<br>
<br>
"For the third question," Nate continues, "you are still dying. Besides the<br>
effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal.<br>
In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years.<br>
Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is." Nate seemed vastly<br>
amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin.<br>
<br>
"As for the fourth question," Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack<br>
could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read<br>
talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, "first you have to agree<br>
to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell<br>
you."<br>
<br>
"Wait," joked Jack, "isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd<br>
have to kill me?"<br>
<br>
"I thought that was implied." Nate continued to look serious.<br>
<br>
"Ummm...yeah." Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was<br>
talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a<br>
nasty temper. "So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really<br>
stop the effects of the methanol?" Jack thought for a second. "And, what do<br>
you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper<br>
fluid, and just denature it?"<br>
<br>
"They may, I don't really know," said Nate. "I haven't gotten out in a<br>
while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and<br>
on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you<br>
pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume<br>
that they still color wiper fluid blue?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, they do," said Jack.<br>
<br>
"I figured," replied Nate. "As for being bound by secrecy - with the<br>
fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me,<br>
this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you<br>
decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me,<br>
write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will<br>
lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of<br>
course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm<br>
guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding<br>
anyway, so you won't notice." Nate said the last part with utter confidence.<br>
<br>
Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a<br>
little nervous at this. "Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know<br>
that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?"<br>
<br>
Well, Jack," said Nate sadly, "I can't tell you that, unless you make the<br>
second request." Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back.<br>
<br>
"Umm, well, ok," said Jack, "what is this about a second request? What can I<br>
ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?"<br>
<br>
"Sure!" said Nate, brightening. "You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes<br>
to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and<br>
before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or<br>
omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous<br>
and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and<br>
sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be<br>
omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very<br>
useful, at least in my opinion." Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was<br>
staring at him.<br>
<br>
"Well, anyway," continued Nate, "I'd probably suggest giving you permanent<br>
good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be<br>
immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long<br>
time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to<br>
recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a<br>
request to me."<br>
<br>
"Cure the methanol poisoning, huh?" said Jack. "And keep me healthy for a<br>
long time? Hmmm. It doesn't sound bad at that. And it has to be a request<br>
about a change to me? I can't ask to be rich, right? Because that's not<br>
really a change to me?"<br>
<br>
"Right," nodded Nate.<br>
<br>
"Could I ask to be a genius and permanently healthy?" Jack asked, hopefully.<br>
<br>
"That takes two requests, Jack."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I figured so," said Jack. "But I could ask to be a genius? I could<br>
become the smartest scientist in the world? Or the best athlete?"<br>
<br>
"Well, I could make you very smart," admitted Nate, "but that wouldn't<br>
necessarily make you the best scientist in the world. Or, I could make you<br>
very athletic, but it wouldn't necessarily make you the best athlete either.<br>
You've heard the saying that 99% of genius is hard work? Well, there's some<br>
truth to that. I can give you the talent, but I can't make you work hard. It<br>
all depends on what you decide to do with it."<br>
<br>
"Hmmm," said Jack. "Ok, I think I understand. And I get a third request,<br>
after this one?"<br>
<br>
"Maybe," said Nate, "it depends on what you decide then. There are more<br>
rules for the third request that I can only tell you about after the second<br>
request. You know how it goes." Nate looked like he'd shrug, if he had<br>
shoulders.<br>
<br>
"Ok, well, since I'd rather not be blind in a day or two, and permanent<br>
health doesn't sound bad, then consider that my second request. Officially.<br>
Do I need to sign in blood or something?"<br>
<br>
"No," said Nate. "Just hold out your hand. Or heel." Nate grinned. "Or<br>
whatever part you want me to bite. I have to bite you again. Like I said,<br>
that's how it works - the poison, you know," Nate said apologetically.<br>
<br>
Jack winced a little and felt his shoulder, where the last bite was. Hey, it<br>
didn't hurt any more. Just like Nate had said. That made Jack feel better<br>
about the biting business. But still, standing still while a fifteen foot<br>
snake sunk it's fangs into you. Jack stood up. Ignoring how good it felt to<br>
be able to stand again, and the hunger starting to gnaw at his stomach, Jack<br>
tried to decide where he wanted to get bitten. Despite knowing that it<br>
wouldn't hurt for long, Jack knew that this wasn't going to be easy.<br>
<br>
"Hey, Jack," Nate suddenly said, looking past Jack towards the dunes behind<br>
him, "is that someone else coming up over there?"<br>
<br>
Jack spun around and looked. Who else could be out here in the middle of<br>
nowhere? And did they bring food?<br>
<br>
Wait a minute, there was nobody over there. What was Nate...<br>
<br>
Jack let out a bellow as he felt two fangs sink into his rear end, through<br>
his jeans...<br>
<br>
Jack sat down carefully, favoring his more tender buttock. "I would have<br>
decided, eventually, Nate. I was just thinking about it. You didn't have to<br>
hoodwink me like that."<br>
<br>
"I've been doing this a long time, Jack," said Nate, confidently. "You<br>
humans have a hard time sitting still and letting a snake bite you -<br>
especially one my size. And besides, admit it - it's only been a couple of<br>
minutes and it already doesn't hurt any more, does it? That's because of the<br>
health benefit with this one. I told you that you'd heal quickly now."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, well, still," said Jack, "it's the principle of the thing. And nobody<br>
likes being bitten in the butt! Couldn't you have gotten my calf or<br>
something instead?"<br>
<br>
"More meat in the typical human butt," replied Nate. "And less chance you<br>
accidentally kick me or move at the last second."<br>
<br>
"Yeah, right. So, tell me all of these wonderful secrets that I now qualify<br>
to hear," answered Jack.<br>
<br>
"Ok," said Nate. "Do you want to ask questions first, or do you want me to<br>
just start talking?"<br>
<br>
"Just talk," said Jack. "I'll sit here and try to not think about food."<br>
<br>
"We could go try to rustle up some food for you first, if you like,"<br>
answered Nate.<br>
<br>
"Hey! You didn't tell me you had food around here, Nate!" Jack jumped up.<br>
"What do we have? Am I in walking distance to town? Or can you magically<br>
whip up food along with your other powers?" Jack was almost shouting with<br>
excitement. His stomach had been growling for hours.<br>
<br>
"I was thinking more like I could flush something out of its hole and bite<br>
it for you, and you could skin it and eat it. Assuming you have a knife,<br>
that is," replied Nate, with the grin that Jack was starting to get used to.<br>
<br>
"Ugh," said Jack, sitting back down. "I think I'll pass. I can last a little<br>
longer before I get desperate enough to eat desert rat, or whatever else it<br>
is you find out here. And there's nothing to burn - I'd have to eat it raw.<br>
No thanks. Just talk."<br>
<br>
"Ok," replied Nate, still grinning. "But I'd better hurry, before you start<br>
looking at me as food.<br>
<br>
Nate reared back a little, looked around for a second, and then continued.<br>
"You, Jack, are sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden."<br>
<br>
Jack looked around at the sand and dunes and then looked back at Nate<br>
sceptically.<br>
<br>
"Well, that's the best I can figure it, anyway, Jack," said Nate. "Stand up<br>
and look at the symbol on the rock here." Nate gestured around the dark<br>
stone they were both sitting on with his nose.<br>
<br>
Jack stood up and looked. Carved into the stone in a bas-relief was a<br>
representation of a large tree. The angled-pole that Nate was wrapped around<br>
was coming out of the trunk of the tree, right below where the main branches<br>
left the truck to reach out across the stone. It was very well done - it<br>
looked more like a tree had been reduced to almost two dimensions and<br>
embedded in the stone than it did like a carving.<br>
<br>
Jack walked around and looked at the details in the fading light of the<br>
setting sun. He wished he'd looked at it while the sun was higher in the<br>
sky.<br>
<br>
Wait! The sun was setting! That meant he was going to have to spend another<br>
night out here! Arrrgh!<br>
<br>
Jack looked out across the desert for a little bit, and then came back and<br>
stood next to Nate. "In all the excitement, I almost forgot, Nate," said<br>
Jack. "Which way is it back to town? And how far? I'm eventually going to<br>
have to head back - I'm not sure I'll be able to survive by eating raw<br>
desert critters for long. And even if I can, I'm not sure I'll want to."<br>
<br>
"It's about 30 miles that way." Nate pointed, with the rattle on his tail<br>
this time. As far as Jack could tell, it was a direction at right angles to<br>
the way he'd been going when he was crawling here. "But that's 30 miles by<br>
the way the crow flies. It's about 40 by the way a man walks. You should be<br>
able to do it in about half a day with your improved endurance, if you head<br>
out early tomorrow, Jack."<br>
<br>
Jack looked out the way the snake had pointed for a few seconds more, and<br>
then sat back down. It was getting dark. Not much he could do about heading<br>
out right now. And besides, Nate was just about to get to the interesting<br>
stuff. "Garden of Eden? As best as you can figure it?"<br>
<br>
"Well, yeah, as best as I and Samuel could figure it anyway," said Nate. "He<br>
figured that the story just got a little mixed up. You know, snake, in a<br>
'tree', offering 'temptations', making bargains. That kind stuff. But he<br>
could never quite figure out how the Hebrews found out about this spot from<br>
across the ocean. He worried about that for a while."<br>
<br>
"Garden of Eden, hunh?" said Jack. "How long have you been here, Nate?"<br>
<br>
"No idea, really," replied Nate. "A long time. It never occurred to me to<br>
count years, until recently, and by then, of course, it was too late. But I<br>
do remember when this whole place was green, so I figure it's been thousands<br>
of years, at least."<br>
<br>
"So, are you the snake that tempted Eve?" said Jack.<br>
<br>
"Beats me," said Nate. "Maybe. I can't remember if the first one of your<br>
kind that I talked to was female or not, and I never got a name, but it<br>
could have been. And I suppose she could have considered my offer to grant<br>
requests a 'temptation', though I've rarely had refusals."<br>
<br>
"Well, umm, how did you get here then? And why is that white pole stuck out<br>
of the stone there?" asked Jack.<br>
<br>
"Dad left me here. Or, I assume it was my dad. It was another snake - much<br>
bigger than I was back then. I remember talking to him, but I don't remember<br>
if it was in a language, or just kind of understanding what he wanted. But<br>
one day, he brought me to this stone, told me about it, and asked me to do<br>
something for him. I talked it over with him for a while, then agreed. I've<br>
been here ever since.<br>
<br>
"What is this place?" said Jack. "And what did he ask you to do?"<br>
<br>
"Well, you see this pole here, sticking out of the stone?" Nate loosened his<br>
coils around the tilted white pole and showed Jack where it descended into<br>
the stone. The pole was tilted at about a 45 degree angle and seemed to<br>
enter the stone in an eighteen inch slot cut into the stone. Jack leaned<br>
over and looked. The slot was dark and the pole went down into it as far as<br>
Jack could see in the dim light. Jack reached out to touch the pole, but<br>
Nate was suddenly there in the way.<br>
<br>
"You can't touch that yet, Jack," said Nate.<br>
<br>
"Why not?" asked Jack.<br>
<br>
"I haven't explained it to you yet," replied Nate.<br>
<br>
"Well, it kinda looks like a lever or something," said Jack. "You'd push it<br>
that way, and it would move in the slot."<br>
<br>
"Yep, that's what it is," replied Nate.<br>
<br>
"What does it do?" asked Jack. "End the world?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, no," said Nate. "Nothing that drastic. It just ends humanity. I call it<br>
'The Lever of Doom'." For the last few words Nate had used a deeper, ringing<br>
voice. He tried to look serious for a few seconds, and then gave up and<br>
grinned.<br>
<br>
Jack was initially startled by Nate's pronouncement, but when Nate grinned<br>
Jack laughed. "Ha! You almost had me fooled for a second there. What does it<br>
really do?"<br>
<br>
"Oh, it really ends humanity, like I said," smirked Nate. "I just thought<br>
the voice I used was funny, didn't you?"<br>
<br>
Nate continued to grin.<br>
<br>
"A lever to end humanity?" asked Jack. "What in the world is that for? Why<br>
would anyone need to end humanity?"<br>
<br>
"Well," replied Nate, "I get the idea that maybe humanity was an experiment.<br>
Or maybe the Big Guy just thought, that if humanity started going really<br>
bad, there should be a way to end it. I'm not really sure. All I know are<br>
the rules, and the guesses that Samuel and I had about why it's here. I<br>
didn't think to ask back when I started here."<br>
<br>
"Rules? What rules?" asked Jack.<br>
<br>
"The rules are that I can't tell anybody about it or let them touch it<br>
unless they agree to be bound to secrecy by a bite. And that only one human<br>
can be bound in that way at a time. That's it." explained Nate.<br>
<br>
Jack looked somewhat shocked. "You mean that I could pull the lever now?<br>
You'd let me end humanity?"<br>
<br>
"Yep," replied Nate, "if you want to." Nate looked at Jack carefully. "Do<br>
you want to, Jack?"<br>
<br>
"Umm, no." said Jack, stepping a little further back from the lever. "Why in<br>
the world would anyone want to end humanity? It'd take a psychotic to want<br>
that! Or worse, a suicidal psychotic, because it would kill him too,<br>
wouldn't it?"<br>
<br>
"Yep," replied Nate, "being as he'd be human too."<br>
<br>
"Has anyone ever seriously considered it?" asked Nate. "Any of those bound<br>
to secrecy, that is?"<br>
<br>
"Well, of course, I think they've all seriously considered it at one time or<br>
another. Being given that kind of responsibility makes you sit down and<br>
think, or so I'm told. Samuel considered it several times. He'd often get<br>
disgusted with humanity, come out here, and just hold the lever for a while.<br>
But he never pulled it. Or you wouldn't be here." Nate grinned some more.<br>
<br>
Jack sat down, well back from the lever. He looked thoughtful and puzzled at<br>
the same time. After a bit, he said, "So this makes me the Judge of<br>
humanity? I get to decide whether they keep going or just end? Me?"<br>
<br>
"That seems to be it," agreed Nate.<br>
<br>
"What kind of criteria do I use to decide?" said Jack. "How do I make this<br>
decision? Am I supposed to decide if they're good? Or too many of them are<br>
bad? Or that they're going the wrong way? Is there a set of rules for that?"<br>
<br>
"Nope," replied Nate. "You pretty much just have to decide on your own. It's<br>
up to you, however you want to decide it. I guess that you're just supposed<br>
to know."<br>
<br>
"But what if I get mad at someone? Or some girl dumps me and I feel<br>
horrible? Couldn't I make a mistake? How do I know that I won't screw up?"<br>
protested Jack.<br>
<br>
Nate gave his kind of snake-like shrug again. "You don't. You just have to<br>
try your best, Jack."<br>
<br>
Jack sat there for a while, staring off into the desert that was rapidly<br>
getting dark, chewing on a fingernail.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, Jack turned around and looked at the snake. "Nate, was Samuel the<br>
one bound to this before me?"<br>
<br>
"Yep," replied Nate. "He was a good guy. Talked to me a lot. Taught me to<br>
read and brought me books. I think I still have a good pile of them buried<br>
in the sand around here somewhere. I still miss him. He died a few months<br>
ago."<br>
<br>
"Sounds like a good guy," agreed Jack. "How did he handle this, when you<br>
first told him. What did he do?"<br>
<br>
"Well," said Nate, "he sat down for a while, thought about it for a bit, and<br>
then asked me some questions, much like you're doing."<br>
<br>
"What did he ask you, if you're allowed to tell me?" asked Jack.<br>
<br>
"He asked me about the third request," replied Nate.<br>
<br>
"Aha!" It was Jack's turn to grin. "And what did you tell him?"<br>
<br>
"I told him the rules for the third request. That to get the third request<br>
you have to agree to this whole thing. That if it ever comes to the point<br>
that you really think that humanity should be ended, that you'll come here<br>
and end it. You won't avoid it, and you won't wimp out." Nate looked serious<br>
again. "And you'll be bound to do it too, Jack."<br>
<br>
"Hmmm." Jack looked back out into the darkness for a while.<br>
<br>
Nate watched him, waiting.<br>
<br>
"Nate," continued Jack, quietly, eventually. "What did Samuel ask for with<br>
his third request?"<br>
<br>
Nate sounded like he was grinning again as he replied, also quietly,<br>
"Wisdom, Jack. He asked for wisdom. As much as I could give him."<br>
<br>
"Ok," said Jack, suddenly, standing up and facing away from Nate, "give it<br>
to me.<br>
<br>
Nate looked at Jack's backside. "Give you what, Jack?"<br>
<br>
"Give me that wisdom. The same stuff that Samuel asked for. If it helped<br>
him, maybe it'll help me too." Jack turned his head to look back over his<br>
shoulder at Nate. "It did help him, right?"<br>
<br>
"He said it did," replied Nate. "But he seemed a little quieter afterward.<br>
Like he had a lot to think about."<br>
<br>
"Well, yeah, I can see that," said Jack. "So, give it to me." Jack turned to<br>
face away from Nate again, bent over slightly and tensed up.<br>
<br>
Nate watched Jack tense up with a little exasperation. If he bit Jack now,<br>
Jack would likely jump out of his skin and maybe hurt them both.<br>
<br>
"You remember that you'll be bound to destroy humanity if it ever looks like<br>
it needs it, right Jack?" asked Nate, shifting position.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, yeah, I got that," replied Jack, eyes squeezed tightly shut and body<br>
tense, not noticing the change in direction of Nate's voice.<br>
<br>
"And," continued Nate, from his new position, "do you remember that you'll<br>
turn bright purple, and grow big horns and extra eyes?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, yeah...Hey, wait a minute!" said Jack, opening his eyes,<br>
straightening up and turning around. "Purple?!" He didn't see Nate there.<br>
With the moonlight Jack could see that the lever extended up from its slot<br>
in the rock without the snake wrapped around it.<br>
<br>
Jack heard, from behind him, Nate's "Just Kidding!" right before he felt the<br>
now familiar piercing pain, this time in the other buttock.<br>
<br>
Jack sat on the edge of the dark stone in the rapidly cooling air, his feet<br>
extending out into the sand. He stared out into the darkness, listening to<br>
the wind stir the sand, occasionally rubbing his butt where he'd been<br>
recently bitten.<br>
<br>
Nate had left for a little while, had come back with a desert-rodent-shaped<br>
bulge somewhere in his middle, and was now wrapped back around the lever,<br>
his tongue flicking out into the desert night's air the only sign that he<br>
was still awake.<br>
<br>
Occasionally Jack, with his toes absentmindedly digging in the sand while he<br>
thought, would ask Nate a question without turning around.<br>
<br>
"Nate, do accidents count?"<br>
<br>
Nate lifted his head a little bit. "What do you mean, Jack?"<br>
<br>
Jack tilted his head back like he was looking at the stars. "You know,<br>
accidents. If I accidentally fall on the lever, without meaning to, does<br>
that still wipe out humanity?"<br>
<br>
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does, Jack. I'd suggest you be careful about that<br>
if you start feeling wobbly," said Nate with some amusement.<br>
<br>
A little later - "Does it have to be me that pulls the lever?" asked Jack.<br>
<br>
"That's the rule, Jack. Nobody else can pull it," answered Nate.<br>
<br>
"No," Jack shook his head, "I meant does it have to be my hand? Could I pull<br>
the lever with a rope tied around it? Or push it with a stick? Or throw a<br>
rock?"<br>
<br>
"Yes, those should work," replied Nate. "Though I'm not sure how complicated<br>
you could get. Samuel thought about trying to build some kind of remote<br>
control for it once, but gave it up. Everything he'd build would be gone by<br>
the next sunrise, if it was touching the stone, or over it. I told him that<br>
in the past others that had been bound had tried to bury the lever so they<br>
wouldn't be tempted to pull it, but every time the stones or sand or<br>
whatever had disappeared."<br>
<br>
"Wow," said Jack, "Cool." Jack leaned back until only his elbows kept him<br>
off of the stone and looked up into the sky.<br>
<br>
"Nate, how long did Samuel live? One of his wishes was for health too,<br>
right?" asked Jack.<br>
<br>
"Yes," replied Nate, "it was. He lived 167 years, Jack."<br>
<br>
"Wow, 167 years. That's almost 140 more years I'll live if I live as long.<br>
Do you know what he died of, Nate?"<br>
<br>
"He died of getting tired of living, Jack," Nate said, sounding somewhat<br>
sad.<br>
<br>
Jack turned his head to look at Nate in the starlight.<br>
<br>
Nate looked back. "Samuel knew he wasn't going to be able to stay in<br>
society. He figured that they'd eventually see him still alive and start<br>
questioning it, so he decided that he'd have to disappear after a while. He<br>
faked his death once, but changed his mind - he decided it was too early and<br>
he could stay for a little longer. He wasn't very fond of mankind, but he<br>
liked the attention. Most of the time, anyway.<br>
<br>
"His daughter and then his wife dying almost did him in though. He didn't<br>
stay in society much longer after that. He eventually came out here to spend<br>
time talking to me and thinking about pulling the lever. A few months ago he<br>
told me he'd had enough. It was his time."<br>
<br>
"And then he just died?" asked Jack.<br>
<br>
Nate shook his head a little. "He made his forth request, Jack. There's only<br>
one thing you can ask for the fourth request. The last bite.<br>
<br>
After a bit Nate continued, "He told me that he was tired, that it was his<br>
time. He reassured me that someone new would show up soon, like they always<br>
had.<br>
<br>
After another pause, Nate finished, "Samuel's body disappeared off the stone<br>
with the sunrise."<br>
<br>
Jack lay back down and looked at the sky, leaving Nate alone with his<br>
memories. It was a long time until Jack's breathing evened out into sleep.<br>
<br>
Jack woke with the sunrise the next morning. He was a little chilled with<br>
the morning desert air, but overall was feeling pretty good. Well, except<br>
that his stomach was grumbling and he wasn't willing to eat raw desert rat.<br>
<br>
So, after getting directions to town from Nate, making sure he knew how to<br>
get back, and reassuring Nate that he'd be back soon, Jack started the long<br>
walk back to town. With his new health and Nate's good directions, he made<br>
it back easily.<br>
<br>
Jack caught a bus back to the city, and showed up for work the next day,<br>
little worse for the wear and with a story about getting lost in the desert<br>
and walking back out. Within a couple of days Jack had talked a friend with<br>
a tow truck into going back out into the desert with him to fetch the SUV.<br>
They found it after a couple of hours of searching and towed it back without<br>
incident. Jack was careful not to even look in the direction of Nate's<br>
lever, though their path back didn't come within sight of it.<br>
<br>
Before the next weekend, Jack had gone to a couple of stores, including a<br>
book store, and had gotten his SUV back from the mechanic, with a warning to<br>
avoid any more joyriding in the desert. On Saturday, Jack headed back to see<br>
Nate.<br>
<br>
Jack parked a little way out of the small town near Nate, loaded up his new<br>
backpack with camping gear and the things he was bringing for Nate, and then<br>
started walking. He figured that walking would leave the least trail, and he<br>
knew that while not many people camped in the desert, it wasn't unheard of,<br>
and shouldn't really raise suspicions.<br>
<br>
Jack had brought more books for Nate - recent books, magazines, newspapers.<br>
Some things that would catch Nate up with what was happening in the world,<br>
others that were just good books to read. He spent the weekend with Nate,<br>
and then headed out again, telling Nate that he'd be back again soon, but<br>
that he had things to do first.<br>
<br>
Over four months later Jack was back to see Nate again. This time he brought<br>
a laptop with him - a specially modified laptop. It had a solar recharger,<br>
special filters and seals to keep out the sand, a satellite link-up, and a<br>
special keyboard and joystick that Jack hoped that a fifteen-foot<br>
rattlesnake would be able to use. And, it had been hacked to not give out<br>
its location to the satellite.<br>
<br>
After that Jack could e-mail Nate to keep in touch, but still visited him<br>
fairly regularly - at least once or twice a year.<br>
<br>
After the first year, Jack quti his job. For some reason, with the wisdom he<br>
'd been given, and the knowledge that he could live for over 150 years,<br>
working in a nine to five job for someone else didn't seem that worthwhile<br>
any more. Jack went back to school.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Jack started writing. Perhaps because of the wisdom, or perhaps<br>
because of his new perspective, he wrote well. People liked what he wrote,<br>
and he became well known for it. After a time, Jack bought an RV and started<br>
traveling around the country for book signings and readings.<br>
<br>
But, he still remembered to drop by and visit Nate occasionally.<br>
<br>
On one of the visits Nate seemed quieter than usual. Not that Nate had been<br>
a fountain of joy lately. Jack's best guess was that Nate was still missing<br>
Samuel, and though Jack had tried, he still hadn't been able to replace<br>
Samuel in Nate's eyes. Nate had been getting quieter each visit. But on this<br>
visit Nate didn't even speak when Jack walked up to the lever. He nodded at<br>
Jack, and then went back to staring into the desert. Jack, respecting Nate's<br>
silence, sat down and waited.<br>
<br>
After a few minutes, Nate spoke. "Jack, I have someone to introduce you to."<br>
<br>
Jack looked surprised. "Someone to introduce me to?" Jack looked around, and<br>
then looked carefully back at Nate. "This something to do with the Big Guy?<br>
<br>
"No, no," replied Nate. "This is more personal. I want you to meet my son."<br>
Nate looked over at the nearest sand dune. "Sammy!"<br>
<br>
Jack watched as a four foot long desert rattlesnake crawled from behind the<br>
dune and up to the stone base of the lever.<br>
<br>
"Yo, Jack," said the new, much smaller snake.<br>
<br>
"Yo, Sammy" replied Jack. Jack looked at Nate. "Named after Samuel, I<br>
assume?"<br>
<br>
Nate nodded. "Jack, I've got a favor to ask you. Could you show Sammy around<br>
for me?" Nate unwrapped himself from the lever and slithered over to the<br>
edge of the stone and looked across the sands. "When Samuel first told me<br>
about the world, and brought me books and pictures, I wished that I could go<br>
see it. I wanted to see the great forests, the canyons, the cities, even the<br>
other deserts, to see if they felt and smelled the same. I want my son to<br>
have that chance - to see the world. Before he becomes bound here like I<br>
have been.<br>
<br>
"He's seen it in pictures, over the computer that you brought me. But I hear<br>
that it's not the same. That being there is different. I want him to have<br>
that. Think you can do that for me, Jack?"<br>
<br>
Jack nodded. This was obviously very important to Nate, so Jack didn't even<br>
joke about taking a talking rattlesnake out to see the world. "Yeah, I can<br>
do that for you, Nate. Is that all you need?" Jack could sense that was<br>
something more.<br>
<br>
Nate looked at Sammy. Sammy looked back at Nate for a second and then said,<br>
"Oh, yeah. Ummm, I've gotta go pack. Back in a little bit Jack. Nice to meet<br>
ya!" Sammy slithered back over the dune and out of sight.<br>
<br>
Nate watched Sammy disappear and then looked back at Jack. "Jack, this is my<br>
first son. My first offspring through all the years. You don't even want to<br>
know what it took for me to find a mate." Nate grinned to himself. "But<br>
anyway, I had a son for a reason. I'm tired. I'm ready for it to be over. I<br>
needed a replacement."<br>
<br>
Jack considered this for a minute. "So, you're ready to come see the world,<br>
and you wanted him to watch the lever while you were gone?"<br>
<br>
Nate shook his head. "No, Jack - you're a better guesser than that. You've<br>
already figured out - I'm bound here - there's only one way for me to leave<br>
here. And I'm ready. It's my time to die."<br>
<br>
Jack looked more closely at Nate. He could tell Nate had thought about<br>
this - probably for quite a while. Jack had trouble imagining what it would<br>
be like to be as old as Nate, but Jack could already tell that in another<br>
hundred or two hundred years, he might be getting tired of life himself.<br>
Jack could understand Samuel's decision, and now Nate's. So, all Jack said<br>
was, "What do you want me to do?"<br>
<br>
Nate nodded. "Thanks, Jack. I only want two things. One - show Sammy around<br>
the world - let him get his fill of it, until he's ready to come back here<br>
and take over. Two - give me the fourth request.<br>
<br>
"I can't just decide to die, not any more than you can. I won't even die of<br>
old age like you eventually will, even though it'll be a long time from now.<br>
I need to be killed. Once Sammy is back here, ready to take over, I'll be<br>
able to die. And I need you to kill me.<br>
<br>
"I've even thought about how. Poisons and other drugs won't work on me. And<br>
I've seen pictures of snakes that were shot - some of them live for days, so<br>
that's out too. So, I want you to bring back a sword.<br>
<br>
Nate turned away to look back to the dune that Sammy had gone behind. "I'd<br>
say an axe, but that's somewhat undignified - putting my head on the ground<br>
or a chopping block like that. No, I like a sword. A time-honored way of<br>
going out. A dignified way to die. And, most importantly, it should work,<br>
even on me.<br>
<br>
"You willing to do that for me, Jack?" Nate turned back to look at Jack.<br>
<br>
"Yeah, Nate," replied Jack solemnly, "I think I can handle that."<br>
<br>
Nate nodded. "Good!" He turned back toward the dune and shouted, "Sammy!<br>
Jack's about ready to leave!" Then quietly, "Thanks, Jack."<br>
<br>
Jack didn't have anything to say to that, so he waited for Sammy to make it<br>
back to the lever, nodded to him, nodded a final time to Nate, and then<br>
headed into the desert with Sammy following.<br>
Over the next several years Sammy and Jack kept in touch with Nate through<br>
e-mail as they went about their adventures. They made a goal of visiting<br>
every country in the world, and did a respectable job of it. Sammy had a<br>
natural gift for languages, as Jack expected he would, and even ended up<br>
acting as a translator for Jack in a few of the countries. Jack managed to<br>
keep the talking rattlesnake hidden, even so, and by the time they were<br>
nearing the end of their tour of countries, Sammy had only been spotted a<br>
few times. While there were several people that had seen enough to startle<br>
them greatly, nobody had enough evidence to prove anything, and while a few<br>
wild rumors and storied followed Jack and Sammy around, nothing ever hit the<br>
newspapers or the public in general.<br>
<br>
When they finished the tour of countries, Jack suggested that they try some<br>
undersea diving. They did. And spelunking. They did that too. Sammy finally<br>
drew the line at visiting Antarctica. He'd come to realize that Jack was<br>
stalling. After talking to his Dad about it over e-mail, he figured out that<br>
Jack probably didn't want to have to kill Nate. Nate told Sammy that humans<br>
could be squeamish about killing friends and acquaintances.<br>
<br>
So, Sammy eventually put his tail down (as he didn't have a foot) and told<br>
Jack that it was time - he was ready to go back and take up his duties from<br>
his dad. Jack, delayed it a little more by insisting that they go back to<br>
Japan and buy an appropriate sword. He even stretched it a little more by<br>
getting lessons in how to use the sword. But, eventually, he'd learned as<br>
much as he was likely to without dedicating his life to it, and was<br>
definitely competent enough to take the head off of a snake. It was time to<br>
head back and see Nate.<br>
<br>
When they got back to the US, Jack got the old RV out of storage where he<br>
and Sammy had left it after their tour of the fifty states, he loaded up<br>
Sammy and the sword, and they headed for the desert.<br>
<br>
When they got to the small town that Jack had been trying to find those<br>
years ago when he'd met Nate, Jack was in a funk. He didn't really feel like<br>
walking all of the way out there. Not only that, but he'd forgotten to<br>
figure the travel time correctly, and it was late afternoon. They'd either<br>
have to spend the night in town and walk out tomorrow, or walk in the dark.<br>
<br>
As Jack was afraid that if he waited one more night he might lose his<br>
resolve, he decided that he'd go ahead and drive the RV out there. It was<br>
only going to be this once, and Jack would go back and cover the tracks<br>
afterward. They ought to be able to make it out there by nightfall if they<br>
drove, and then they could get it over tonight.<br>
<br>
Jack told Sammy to e-mail Nate that they were coming as he drove out of<br>
sight of the town on the road. They then pulled off the road and headed out<br>
into the desert.<br>
<br>
Everything went well, until they got to the sand dunes. Jack had been<br>
nursing the RV along the whole time, over the rocks, through the creek beds,<br>
revving the engine the few times they almost got stuck. When they came to<br>
the dunes, Jack didn't really think about it, he just downshifted and headed<br>
up the first one. By the third dune, Jack started to regret that he'd<br>
decided to try driving on the sand. The RV was fishtailling and losing<br>
traction. Jack was having to work it up each dune slowly and was trying to<br>
keep from losing control each time they came over the top and slid down the<br>
other side. Sammy had come up to sit in the passenger seat, coiled up and<br>
laughing at Jack's driving.<br>
<br>
As they came over the top of the fourth dune, the biggest one yet, Jack saw<br>
that this was the final dune - the stone, the lever, and somewhere Nate,<br>
waited below. Jack put on the brakes, but he'd gone a little too far. The RV<br>
started slipping down the other side.<br>
<br>
Jack tried turning the wheel, but he didn't have enough traction. He pumped<br>
the brakes - no response. They started sliding down the hill, faster and<br>
faster.<br>
<br>
Jack felt a shock go through him as he suddenly realized that they were<br>
heading for the lever. He looked down - the RV was directly on course for<br>
it. If Jack didn't do something, the RV would hit it. He was about to end<br>
humanity.<br>
<br>
Jack steered more frantically, trying to get traction. It still wasn't<br>
working. The dune was too steep, and the sand too loose. In a split second,<br>
Jack realized that his only chance would be once he hit the stone around the<br>
lever - he should have traction on the stone for just a second before he hit<br>
the lever - he wouldn't have time to stop, but he should be able to steer<br>
away.<br>
<br>
Jack took a better grip on the steering wheel and tried to turn the RV a<br>
little bit - every little bit would help. He'd have to time his turn just<br>
right.<br>
<br>
The RV got to the bottom of the dune, sliding at an amazing speed in the<br>
sand. Just before they reached the stone Jack looked across it to check that<br>
they were still heading for the lever. They were. But Jack noticed something<br>
else that he hadn't seen from the top of the dune. Nate wasn't wrapped<br>
around the lever. He was off to the side of the lever, but still on the<br>
stone, waiting for them. The problem was, he was waiting on the same side of<br>
the lever that Jack had picked to steer towards to avoid the lever. The RV<br>
was already starting to drift that way a little in its mad rush across the<br>
sand and there was no way that Jack was going to be able to go around the<br>
lever to the other side.<br>
<br>
Jack had an instant of realization. He was either going to have to hit the<br>
lever, or run over Nate. He glanced over at Sammy and saw that Sammy<br>
realized the same thing.<br>
<br>
Jack took a firmer grip on the steering wheel as the RV ran up on the stone.<br>
Shouting to Sammy as he pulled the steering wheel, "BETTER NATE THAN LEVER!",<br>
<br>
he ran over the snake.<br>

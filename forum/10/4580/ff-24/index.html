	<div class="content">FF was alright...it just barely missed some key things that could've been ported from TFC, but all in all FF was attempting to catch lightning in a bottle twice but just lacks the soul of TFC by oh so much.

Yes. As a matter of fact, Valve moved up the release of TF2 because of FF. TF2 was supposed to be released a few weeks after the FF date and then Valve released an open beta, which they never do, and then FF moved up their date to counter and then it was all but over for FF in terms of numbers. For me personally, FF is 10 times the game TF2 is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

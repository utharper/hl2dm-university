	<div class="content">Yea the trailer was a bit weak, but if you read the game description, it could be interesting.  Its not supposed to be released until October and if things go as they usually do, that will get moved back.  The game isnt finished yet.  It still looks like it could be interesting and worth keeping an eye on in any case.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Don't forget Day of Defeat. Valve bought all of these betas and totally modified them. I didn't know about Natural Selection.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

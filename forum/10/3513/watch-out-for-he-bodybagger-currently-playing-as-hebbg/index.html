and BTW, ya, many of you dont like zman, and make fun of him for posting what he did, but he's totally right and holds true to the values of fair play and hard work.  although i dont like his cocky posts of his "leetness" i still respect him because he has the balls to point out hackers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol, you hear about all these people hacking, but how many people have you played against that were using hacks to try and beat you? none or if any you would tell them there shit and post it on the forumns and bring more shit to this website  about hax and the game ending etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Z-Man stated that BB got banned for using them, did he say BB was using them for CAL, but got banned in the process? no he did not. so why do you even have to worry about him if it does not even affect you. who cares if people are using hacks to dick around with them, BB did not try and use it in a CAL game or agaisnt you so you should not have to fucking care what he does with it. you don't see everyone in this community lining up to throw their stones at a person for hacking, they probably accept that it is in the game or just don't care. people do as they please and if hacks bother you that much then stick to only playing CAL matches so you will never have to worry about hacks at all<br>
<br>
stretch<br>
<br>
also your next post will be about that it is a bad impression for this site ,(remember you brought it up), and that he should not do hack against the n00bs he was prolly playing</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Also, i have a VAC'd account aswell and there's no thread about it. Should I be jealous? it's not like i kept it secret either, just check for some previous post where i state it clearly and some well known players know about it (people i usually mess around with like ninjins etc.. )<br>
<br>
It seemed too easy to hack and i was curious how the thing works etcetera etcetera, i tried in private 1vs1 where my opponent knew what i was up to wich could be refered as "messing around" It also took a FUCKING long time before it got vac'd.<br>

ya, im one of those "little whiny bitches" that wanna play against ppl that arent fucking hacking.  i just think this is fucking epic that CAL was put on hold for months while grain was investagated only to find out that he wasnt hacking and now its all of a sudden cool to hack as long as you are "making a vid" or "trying it out" or "using it cause it's obvious" or some stupid shit like that.  how you gonna call ppl that try hard to improve their skills without hacks whiny bitches?  this game has turned into a joke cause of ppl like you.  so you're the one who can go FUCK YOURSELF.  just like the rest of the players caught cheating, all your kills are tainted now.  </div></blockquote>

lol, you hear about all these people hacking, but how many people have you played against that were using hacks to try and beat you? none or if any you would tell them there shit and post it on the forumns and bring more shit to this website  about hax and the game ending etc. etc.<br>
<br>
Z-Man stated that BB got banned for using them, did he say BB was using them for CAL, but got banned in the process? no he did not. so why do you even have to worry about him if it does not even affect you. who cares if people are using hacks to dick around with them, BB did not try and use it in a CAL game or agaisnt you so you should not have to fucking care what he does with it. you don't see everyone in this community lining up to throw their stones at a person for hacking, they probably accept that it is in the game or just don't care. people do as they please and if hacks bother you that much then stick to only playing CAL matches so you will never have to worry about hacks at all<br>
<br>
stretch<br>
<br>
also your next post will be about that it is a bad impression for this site ,(remember you brought it up), and that he should not do hack against the n00bs he was prolly playing</div></blockquote>

<br>
ill just pick out the few parts of that post that actually made sense.  so basically you were (attempting) to say that cheating is cool as long as it's not in CAL?  that's just epically brilliant.  Also how would I know if ppl I played against were hacking or not?  I wouldnt.   CAL is dead, dead, dead.  Even if it does some how come back there will be less then 6 teams playing in it.  When i play a match, whether it be CAL, warzone, a scrim, or a pub, I dont think it's unreasonable of me to want all my oppenents (or teammates) to be free of any hacks.  but i guess there are a million excuses to why they were....so fuck it.   As for your last sentence.......FAIL.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Agreed. Making real progress as a player after you've been discovered as a cheater is seen as somewhat suspicious, especially if your skills dramatically increased in a short amount of time. However, I have known players who have tested hacks to find out information, then never used them again. There is no way to say with 100% certainty what people's real motives are. <br>
<br>
I agree that this game's population is small, but that is no reason to completely ignore cheaters, especially from a league's and clan's standpoint. The goal is to keep everything clean and legit, so that everyone can enjoy playing on a level playing field. That being said, keep a list, and it's up to each clan's discretion whether or not to recruit players from this list.<br>
<br>
p.s. do not shoot the messenger, they are just trying to keep this game legit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i love you.  nvm Sac. they just arent going to get it.  its a new rule, hacking is fine. do it until you get caught, VAC banned or w/e. then choose one of the following:<br>
<br>
1-i was making a comedy vid. but never got around to finishing it.<br>
2-i was just testing it, in a pub, without telling anybody.<br>
3-holy said it was K<br>
4-its not like i was using it in CAL<br>
<br>
<br>
then its all cool.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok, let me see if I read earlier responses correctly.  Other people in the community have clearly admitted to using hacks in the past to kill boredom (i.e Conflict).  If I'm not mistaken, he admitted to using one, had his account vac banned as well, and is in the same clan as the dude who started this thread (i.e Z-man).  So, does that mean it is ok to "mess around with" hacks when said offender is in your own clan, but not ok when it's not?  Regardless, yes I (i.e Body Bagger) admit to using a program called Holzed ***LINK EDITED*** and was ulitmately vac banned for it.  Believe me when I say I was crushed and disgusted that my account was takin away from me, because like some (or most of you) I have been playing hl2dm since its first release.  Do I think I did a bad thing?  Yes and No.  Yes - if I would have had the audacity to use this hack in any scrim, 1v1, ecw, or cal match.  No - because I used this hack in one pub server.  In regards to Chemical's response saying hacks should not be used in any fashion (including pubs), I respect your opinion.  Do I think it's a little drastic, yes.  But, any match that I've ever played in, (ECW and CAL), I have NEVER NEVER used this program or any like it.  I would agree with everyone that using these hacks here are disgusting and I probably would be throwing stones with the rest of you.  I am one of the few people left who actually play this game, and I know all of the AT that all of you do too, not because some hack helped me achieve this, but because of hard work and effort to better myself at this game.  I love this game, even with all it's bugs and exploits, (i.e. rate changes, speedcrawling, etc).<br>
I pray that valve actually makes a hl3dm, but because of its learning curve, bugs, lack of interest, I will probably never see this day come.  The thought of this makes me really sad.  It would be like bungie telling their loyal halo2 followers that we will not be releasing a 3rd halo.  I wish we had that sort of following.  But we don't.  Hopefully I'm wrong and Valve surprises me in 5 years. : ).  I'm sorry I caused so much of a commotion, but I'm glad it's out there.  Chemical, if it makes you feel any better, we can play a match, and I will record a demo for you and send it your way.  Maybe I can prove to you and the rest of the naysayers that good players actually dick around every now and then.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

dude, first off, did you once in any of my posts see me say that you are a bad player?  never.  i've played with you a bunch of times on the FF server.  i've always thought you as a nice guy, very respectable and very tallented.  thats why this thread shocked me.  i, unlike most of you, have not been playing this game since its release.  in fact i started playing about 15 months ago because i was sick of play UT2004 and needed a game to hold me over until UT3 came out.  little did i know that i would become so addicted to this game.  i think my addiction to it has A LOT to do with this community and the friends i have made here.  when ever i play a new game, i always think to myself, i wonder what is going on in HL2dm right now.  i have never played hl1 or even played hl2 for more than 5 mins.  just dm.  i took me a long time to get where i am now, which isnt anywhere near as good as some of you who have been playing for years and years.  but i never hack.  and for the record demo's dont prove shit.  do i honestly think that you hack all the time?  honestly, no, i dont.  but i can promise you that every time i see you playing from now on i will question it, and that is something you brought on yourself.  thats it, im done with this thread.  i cant stand repeating myself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't hack and never have, but my comedy video would have been hilarious and, chemicalburn, you CAN use hacks because I said it's K. I suggest using a hack called holzed. It's really neat and its totally undetectable, just like hl2hook. It won't get you VAC'ed or anything. You can totally download it from like 30 websites if you google it. I think it's an awesome idea.</div></blockquote>

Wow. Your officially a retard holymoly. You've just opened the floodgates for newer players who want to cut the learning curve time short. The good thing is that players in HL2DM with enough pure natural skill like Seagull, Nutri, Blas, Luke ect will always have the ability to compete and most likely beat players with lower amounts of brain cells that even with wallhacks or league version aimbots cannot compete with high caliber natural skill players. The same cannot be said for counter strike..Holy and BB you guys officially look like jerkoffs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i have no sympathy for anyone whose been vac banned... UNTIL they stop rationalizing the "why" and show some genuine remorse.  thats not being hypocritical.<br>
<br>
i dont' find cheating humorous.  and i dont see the difference between using cheats in a pub or in league play.  for me, competition is fun and so is pubbing.  i enjoy competition more than pubbing due to the "wow" factor of seeing some really skilled play.  but i dont devalue pubbing to a categorie that makes cheating acceptable.<br>
<br>
i have no idea who/what you're referring to with the fios/cal matches thing.  so you're making an assumption that its a "known" fact throughout the community.  unless you care to elaborate and educate us mushrooms, i'll chalk that part of your post up to innuendo/gossip/hearsay.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have to agree with Cellar that anyone that has been Vac'd really doesnt deserve sympathy, but when it is someone I have known for a long time, it does make me pause a bit before passing complete judgement.   The only thing that I will add is that haxing in a pub has got to be the lamest shit on earth.  I mean seriously you got to hax to beat the guy that spawns and runs at you with the SMG spraying.  LMAO.    Also how are we going to get aspiring pub players to want to learn more if all they see is the "l33t" players just using hax?  Hell half of them think we hax as it is.  I am not a great player and I certainly dont consider myself l33t, but I usually do very well in pubs and I also want level a playing field so that I know the results of a round are due to pure skill, maybe some luck, not a computer program designed to take that out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Holy and BodyBagger.  I have known both of you almost since the time I started playing this game.  BB, I was one of the noobs that hung out on the HE server three years ago and played with you and many other HE from back then.   I always thought you were a good player, you certainly took me to school often back then.   I can understand being curious about how something works, but it does tarnish both of your reps (not that you should care) to know that you have done this and will make people wonder if there is more to it.  I am not passing judgement per se; personally, I give you credit for admitting it, but youll have to face some flammage as you are seeing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I recruited everyone to the positions here, and my conscience is clean. I don't care that one person participated in FIOS when they shouldn't have. Correct, he shouldn't have done it, but that isn't even a fraction as bad as hacking. I know nothing of any account sharing.<br>
<br>
I don't "lul" when someone gets caught hacking, I write them off immediately. Just because some threads are more reactionary than others doesn't make me a hypocrite here either.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I tested the latest hacks around when the new ACS was around to feed suggestions and to know what to check in general when looking at "this one guy suspicious demo"<br>
<br>
I had about 4 1v1 with luke in a locked server and no one else, I took time comparing my old  demos vs the ones im hacking on demos to know what to look after when shit hits the fan about cheating people and I knew how it was i could add my word to the questioning of some people's play and turn the tide in their favor.<br>

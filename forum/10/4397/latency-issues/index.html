	<div class="content">the past two days my ave ping is 20-30 higher than usual.  i cant find a single server below 54.  i used to ping from st louis to chicago in the 20's to 30's.  now its 50's and 60's.<br>
<br>
any suggestions for something to look for as to the cause?  or is my isp (att dsl) just borked recently?<br>
<br>
my dsl has always been pretty shitty.  about 1.9 down and .4 up.  but this ping thing is new.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Everytime I call tech support, I tell them I graduated in IT and work as a network admin for my job, I could probably work for their company, and I know he's some 17 years old who wrote ''good with computer'' on his resume.<br>
<br>
<br>
I immediately get transfered to what these poor tech support souls might refer as ''the higher being'' wich would be an actual technician, then my shit either get fixed or i'm told the neighborhood is affected aswell and the issue will be resolved when i wake up tomorow morning.<br>

My phone company (BT) are like that they tell me the hissing and crackling  Ihear on my line is the broadband, yes that very same broadband  I disconnected 20 minutes ago and have disconnected all extensions in the house and plugged the corded phone into their test socket which tests their equipment only and what do you know its still the same, the worst part is they want me to agree to pay them £120 if they find nothing wrong, they wont even send anyone out unless  Iagree.<br>

obviously you've never had the pleasure of calling att support before.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
<br>
its not that big of a deal, at this point, to warrant a call to them.  but i do want to explore other possibilities beforehand so i can rebut their utter nonsense.<br>

lordy, i hate calling them.  fuckers ALWAYS try to sneak in a new fangled "service" that they "promise" will be cheaper... which ALWAYS ends up costing more in the long run.  bastids!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'd try to get a new modem out of them if you can as the first hop is your network card or onboard lan going to your modem, then the second hop is the modem going to the first router on the isp network and it really shouldn't take 43ms to make that hop.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">someone who understands broadband is going to have to explain this to me.  cause i feel like at&amp;t just scammed me.<br>
<br>
background:  1.5 meg adsl was all that was available at my house for 7 years.  last year, i discovered that 3 meg was available at my house... and it was $10 a month cheaper.  wtf!  so i cuss them out and get the 3 meg.  it has been problem free for the past year.  although i never approached the 3 meg speeds (which at&amp;t tells me is normal).  my speeds averaged around 1.9 down and .41 up.<br>
<br>
about 5 days ago the latency issue developed... and you've seen my progress up to this morning when an at&amp;t tech came a calling.<br>
<br>
now, the tech hooks up his thingy outside the house and determines there are no problems with lines inside or outside the house.  BUT... my dsl is running at 100% all the time, which he says is bad.  he claims he read all kinds of errors and drops (which i have never experienced?  is that possible?) and that i never should have had the 3 meg service!  WTF!  so, he tries calling back to the at&amp;t to get them to back my line down 1.5 meg.  i argue with him a bit and say ive had the 3 meg for a year with no problems and i want to keep it.  nope, not gonna happen he says.  then he sits in his truck for 2 hours, in my driveway, talking on the phone.  apparently he cant through to support any easier than the rest of us poor schmucks!<br>
<br>
so while he sits in his truck, i randomly poll my dsl speed on speedtest.  lo and behold, i start seeing my latency back in the 20's AND my down speed jumps to 2.3 meg and up to .45!  yippeee!  or so i think.  he finally knocks on the door and says he could only fix it by downgrading me to 1.5 meg.  i says "bullshit".  and told him what i saw.  he went on and on about the unreliability of those "net" tests.  so i says, lemme try my game before you leave.  guess what... latency in the 60's and 70's to the same chicago servers.  motherfuckers!  i says "you havent fixed the damn problem".  finally, he decides to check the dsl modem and discovers its set to "interleave".  he changes that and my pings return to normal 20's.  i says "how did that happen?"  the "machine" did it, he says.  "what machine is that?", i says.  then he launches into an explanation, AGAIN, that my dsl line was running full throttle, and thats bad bad bad, so the interleave "automatically" kicked on.  <br>
<br>
any of this make sense?  me and my 1.5 meg dsl would like to know what you think.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok what that means is that your dsl line is not very good and not capable of reliably delivering the higher speed service. I had a similar problem back in the day when I ran dsl and went through the exact same downgrade in service to see a improvement in my dsl.<br>
 The problem is likely caused by the distance you are located from the central office and you are on the edge or "cusp" of service as they may call it. By backing your service back down to the lower tiered platform they can increase the reliability of your service. What they are telling you may sound like BS but it is in fact true and there is a bunch more technical stuff that goes into explaining the how and why it is true, but I won't go into that it's unlikely either one of us would fully understand that.<br>
The interleaving is like a "safe" mode they can put your service into at the central office and it may be the only way to get you back down to the lowered tier or "speed package". What I would do at this point is get cable (if its a option) if not try it out on this interleaved mode and see if its any better than before, if you see no improvement contact the technical support dept and ask them if its possible for you to remove the interleave and still be on the lower speed tier.<br>
After I went through all this I finally got cable, and have much more happy with my service ever since.<br>

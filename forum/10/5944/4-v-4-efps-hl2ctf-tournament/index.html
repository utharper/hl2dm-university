	<div class="content">I'm really curious for the map pool and rule set.<br>
<br>
For the rules, I guess you'd do 20 min timer, 8 flag cap max on most maps. However, I think having no flag cap max would be fun; there are certain maps where it's very possible to get 8/8 against the other team's 6/8 or 7/8 (Epicenter, 2fort) with more than a few minutes left in the clock. I think 8 max would just be too much of a blitz sometimes. It also tends to cockblock epic comebacks and close games too. I'm guessing most people would want Runes enabled?<br>
<br>
There are two maps that <em class="text-italics">everyone</em> will agree for 4v4 play: Dirtwork and Prisonriot.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Dirtwork</strong> is pretty much the dust2 of this game: it's perfectly sized, makes very good use of HL2CTF's movement (unintentionally, seeing as how the map was made before the wall jump was in the mod), and doesn't have retarded weapon placements.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Prisonriot</strong> is similar to Lockdown, but is also more varied. There's closed and open hallways and corridors, somewhat claustrophobic areas like the flag room, and a very open Mess Hall containing the Magnum. The weapons and items are nearly perfectly placed; the only silly thing is the double SMG nade placement at both the flag room and the shotgun room. Fortunately, this is remedied by the fact that the SMG itself is out of reach, so you can't just spawn and become a SMG-nade hero in a few seconds. Orbs, though underused in pubs, are game makers, just as they are in Lockdown. And there's no RPG.<br>
<br>
The other maps are more debatable, often because they're either too small, encourage brainless gameplay (the Canyons, though they are <em class="text-italics">awesome</em> for pubbing), and/or have questionable weapon/item placements (one particular map has FOUR RPGs in it...). Some are "fit" for competitive play, but suffer from the same problem as dm_Amplitude did in league play: no one likes playing them.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Contrary to what TF2, TFC, and HL2DMCTF may have you believe, <strong class="text-strong">2fort</strong> is pretty offense-oriented in this mod. It's unique in that the RPG + Shield rune for each team is stored in a "secret supply", activated by the big button on the soda machine in the flag room. However, the soda machine's on a 3-minute timer, so dying as the basement defender with the RPG is a HUGE deal. There's also the new sewer entrance, but the door is locked from the sewerway; to open it, you must have a teammate press the button in the battlements. However, you can always leave the basement through the sewers. At any rate, the sewers contain team Cloak runes and an RPG ammo crate, offering basement defenders some interesting options. To refill the RPG, they can go through the secret sewer path to the crate, but they risk someone sneaking into the flag room during that time.<br>
<br>
"But basement defense in this map must be stupid-easy like in the map's other incarnations. Besides, RPG + Shield rune sounds pretty lame man." That combo can be tough. However, it's not as invincible as you think; as aforementioned, keeping up on RPG ammo is risky and difficult. The RPG is also pretty nerfed; if someone's particularly ninja-y with wall jumping, you might have to waste three rockets on a <em class="text-italics">single</em> guy. There's always orbs too. And remember, when someone dies, all his SLAMs explode (yes, even the tripmine laser ones); dying once as a basement defender changes the game. It's pretty stressful when you're against good players.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
You know, <strong class="text-strong">Epicenter</strong> would be fine if it weren't for one thing: the RPG. Unlike 2fort, the RPG is on an easily-accessible roof on each side, sitting on a 20-second respawn timer. I remember herpa-derping an 8v8 cause of this. It's a shame, because the rest of the map is pretty varied architecturally and really rewards good movement and coordinated pushes/defenses, that is until someone herpa-derps their way to victory with RPGs. Yes, it's "balanced" because both teams can do it, but does anyone who doesn't need a crutch really want to play RPG vs RPG? RPGs shouldn't be a crutch to "encourage defensive play" (which you can easily do better with, say, SMG nades, slams, orbs); they're probably going to be used as battering rams and spawn camping tools anyway, given how they're placed here.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Lambdabunker</strong> looks pretty solid overall. The RPG is similar to Dirtwork's; it's very, very easy to get. However, getting out takes a bit. However, there's also no glaring cues that someone's warped to the RPG sewers. The item placements aren't exactly dynamic; you get the Shotgun, Magnum, lotsa armor, and even SMG nades from simply patrolling your base. Runes are no exception; all four of them sit next to one another at your base. Despite it feeling ginormuos, I think it's similarly sized to Prisonriot (and a lot more open) horizontally. The most interesting thing about the map is that it is asymmetrical. Shouldn't really affect balance if both teams play both Rebels and Combine.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Greatwall</strong> is an often forgotten map, despite being a serious oldie. Maybe for good reason. The map lacks batteries completely, and health is quite scarce. The weapons are pretty abundant, though. So, expect to die a lot. The RPG and team cloak runes are also smack in the middle, just sitting on their default spawn timers (no soda machine gimmick or anything). With this, expect to die a LOT. It's got a very different feel to it. Oh, and it's pretty big... Maybe these reasons are why it's not often played.<br>
<br>
However, Greatwall also seems to demand the most teamwork as well, which I see as a plus for the map. The two bases are connected by these "forcefields"; if you have one person at each base and coordinate, you can temporarily open a shortcut between the bases. Or you can perhaps pass the flag through this shortcut while your dedicated defender takes a break from his chores. The map's varied vertical levels, with its battlements and whatnot, also open opportunities for some good flag passing.<br>
<br>
Despite it being quite different from other maps, I think this deserves a chance for 4v4 play.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Storm</strong> suffers the same problem as Epicenter: STUPID RPG. It's not very interesting architecturally either.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Elite</strong> is that map with the four RPGs. I think that having instead a single RPG in the middle of the well would solve this (you'd need to use the Lung rune and traverse a loooooooong time underwater to get this, in which you are subject to crossbows, railguns, and pistol fire). It's a huge map, yeah, but it's rather simple and maneuverable for eight people. But I digress; there's four rocket launchers in this map.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Given the way CP maps reset rounds, they're incredibly unstable. And the maps themselves alter the server's timer, so stalemates can become INCREDIBLY long. You can't exactly control how many rounds will be played either.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
I don't like the idea of DOM and TC maps being in HL2CTF 2.0's first tournament, so I'll be really biased if I evaluate those maps. They can be legitimate maps though, but do others want to play them? I'm interested to see what you guys think.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

All that shit talk from a guy who lost to maybe the 3rd best 2v2 team in the land last time I played you (me and bahlk). If you actually played scrims and knew what the situation was you'd understand fantom is probably the best overall player right now maybe next to edge.<br>

But w/e I guess once again if I decide to return and practice after this paper is done I'll let results do the talking. I would love to see you actually play on a 4v4 team against us ~LoL~</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

  Once again i gotta explain to you in a child-like fashion.  We lost a few games to you guys, But we won the majority. We won maybe 6 of 8 against  you 2. So winning 1 or 2 games does not mean <br>
<br>
that you 2 are better. Once again you refer back to a few games that were played with a team member.  You alone are good at no game. You rely on bahlk, blasphemy and phantom. You never have <br>
<br>
proven yourself individually at any game. All i know of you valiums is to either talk shit about how good you are, or talk shit for someone else like phantom. Does it make you feel all warm inside to <br>
<br>
shout off that phantom is so great and will slaughter all of us? Do you say this because you can't speak for yourself?  <br>
<br>
And id love to see how good you could be at CTF. I see you down in the dumps.....Cheers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We had 4 scrims, we split them even and won by 20+ the last time I played you in a real server where I "carried" bahlk with a top score even though there's no such thing as carrying in team games.

Actually we are reviving rivalries and tension, unfortunately retired people are doing it. Although I have no idea what "ace2scrim"'s excuse is for retiring and claiming he could've been a somebody.<br>

Baseball, hockey twice, dodgeball, biking, and football. I broke this bone by running towards the stairs and hitting my toe on the couch. This xray was pretty gruesome. The toe was curved off to the left.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm glad i've experienced a nasty broken bone when I was younger.  I think it really helped to boost up my pain tollerance.  Cause man nothing has EVER hurt more than the broken bone I described above in a previous post.  I mean I broke my pinky a couple years later and didn't even notice until someone said it looked weird, and sure enough when I actually looked at it the damn thing was shaped like a ski jump lol.  Femur is a pretty narly break from what I've heard BI, cause the bone gets pulled by your muscles out of position.  *shudder* just like in your x-ray the ends got pulled past each other!! OWY I'm so glad I haven't boken anything lately lol, only bone bruises and road rash lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We only survived because of seatbelts and the way the car was built, I had to kick a window down, climb out, walk up a freaking hill with a hairline fracture in my neck and a broken foot (adrenaline kept me going, I practically fainted when paramedics got to me) They had to use the jaws of life to get her out and airlifted, she was in a coma for 10 days and was never the same (lots of facial fractures)  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

I started having pain problems in my late 20's, nerve damage that travels down my arms (the particular vertebra feeds down the arms and last 2 fingers) I can't really feel my pinkies but I can surely feel the pain, go figure. The docs were pretty amazed I wasn't paralized, nothing they can do to fix a broke neck  so it restricted my activities for the rest of my life. Rode a rollercoaster once, because I was being daring, had to wear a neck brace for a month just from the whiplash.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> <br>

The gamepad on consoles are so tough to get used to when playing first person shooters. I tried Halo 3 for a bit on the 360 and failed miserably.<br>
There's no such thing as "twitch" with a gamepad and its so frustrating.<br>
<br>
So what are everyones favorite maps?<br>
Mine have to be <a href="http://glooba.ath.cx:8080/~defme/panama_canal.png" class="postlink">Panama Canal</a> and <a href="http://glooba.ath.cx:8080/~defme/laguna_alta.png" class="postlink">Laguna Alta</a> on Conquest. For Rush it would be both <a href="http://glooba.ath.cx:8080/~defme/laguna_presa.png" class="postlink">Laguna Presa</a> and <a href="http://glooba.ath.cx:8080/~defme/arica_harbor.png" class="postlink">Arica Harbor</a>.<br>
<br>
And thank god you're not one of those useless wookies, chEmicalbuRn. There is nothing more annoying then recons that wont work on the objective. In the rare occasion when I go recon, I'm the kind of player that'll wanna snipe a baddie from 20 yards out while laying down motion mine assists and blowing up tanks with C4 like woah.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah I've been over 20 on more then one occasion. The 28 stab one was funny though. I got behind the enemy lines while on offense and took out a herd of them, like 8 or 9, before finally being taken down. It was as if they didnt know what to do as I just kept stabbing them all right next to each other lmao. I had a few Elite guys in vent playing as well and they were lol'ing as I did the play by play while continuing to stab them all lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I kinda thought the same about the start off weapons being weak, until I came across the engineers <a href="http://battlefield.wikia.com/wiki/9A-91_Avtomat" class="postlink">starter</a>.<br>
The Avtomat has so much stopping power without the need of the magnum upgrade. It evens sounds awesome when fired.<br>
Kinda reminds me of that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebhKro1jxzs" class="postlink">silenced shotgun</a> Anton Chigurh, from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/" class="postlink">No Country for Old Men</a>, toted during the motel scene.<br>

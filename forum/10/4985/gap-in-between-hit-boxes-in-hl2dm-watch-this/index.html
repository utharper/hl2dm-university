The reason why this is strange is because when I fired the shotgun shot, the player in front's hitbox was completely blocking the player behind who was perfectly aligned behind the player in front, so how come the shot dropped both players? See it wouldn't have been that uncommon if the player behind was a teensie bit to the left for example as then it would be showing some of its hitbox, but this wasn't the case.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

1. Login to internet<br>

But yeah, I always tought shotgun spread was acting like this:<br>
<br>
----<br>
----<br>
---<br>
-----<br>
<br>
^ bullets spread<br>
<br>
<br>
some bullets are SLIGHTLY behind and some slightly more to the front in the spread, so I believe sunshine is right and when happened is the first ''wave'' of pellets killed the 1st dood then the rest killed the other dood. Doesn't happen often i'll admit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">But as I already stated and if you look carefully, the player in front is fully blocking the player behind him, I've slowmo'd it down to the slowest speed and the player in front covers him the whole time when the shotgun shot is fired, completely, thats why it doesnt make sense, the other pellets couldn't have gone and hit the player behind because he was FULLY aligned with the player in front and my shotgun in a straight line when the shotgun shot was fired. I have heard about leaks in the hitboxes before and this looks to be the case.

Yeah but theres a HUGE difference in getting it in a scrim compared to a pub lmao, all you do is pub, you never played any scrims, that was a 2v2 and I dropped both players so it was decent, learn something, it wouldn't have been as special even if it were a 3v3 or 4v4, it's easy as to get it in a pub ffa lmao.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No one admitted shit because that config was never used in CAL you illiterate, giant headed dwarf.  It was all explained to you and you chose to believe what you wanted because you can't accept the fact that PB and Grain would rape your face completely off. <br>

	<div class="content">The shots fired are unlikely to come before or after anything. The game calculates bullets as trace lines which all will take place in the same frame. Back in HL1 there were demonstrations that bugs in the game would cause odd issues. They could take an AWP and fire it at a line of players and sometimes not all the player would get hit. Meaning somehow a single traceline had not calculated a hit on a player. It would not surprise me if these still exist, it would surprise me if anyone at valve went through extra work to write code for a shotgun that fired pellets at different speeds. Trace lines are instant they have no velocity or infinite velocity depending on how you want to think of it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

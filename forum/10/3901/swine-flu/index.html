	<div class="content">I think those of us living in America have heard the latest media sensation which is going to kill us all. After having survived Y2K, foot and mouth disease, Saddam Hussein's nuclear weapons, SARS, monkey pox, mad cow disease, West Nile virus, the bird flu, and the conficker virus, I am pretty sure I will be able to make it through the swine flu or whatever else the media is going to tell me will kill me.<br>
<br>
My question is what is the extent to which this is being covered in the media in Europe and elsewhere? If some of the non-American people on here can help me out, I'd be interested in knowing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

a mexican crossed the border to goto a hospital and died from swine flu,  so they shut down all high school sports in a county in Texas.  Pretty silly.

I want Yellow Journalism again over the mock-impartiality mock-objectivity of our current media. They aren't saying that you'll die from swine flu but they make sure that 'pandemic' is used no less than twice per sentence, mention that discussions are taking place to close Hospitals, Sea Ports, Whole Countries, and Pizza Hut even if the discussion was really just a homeless person talking at a pigeon, and all this with a straight face and sternness like a doctor telling you that you got rectum cancer.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They just warn about an eventual flu that killed a bunch of people and now we should piss our pants.<br>
<br>
It has now become very hard to get death numbers of the ''regular flu'' because now when you type google anything about flus all you get is that influenza / swine flu crap.<br>
<br>
But yearly, this good old flu we all know would killed over 60 000 people (mostly oldies but still) so when shit hits the fan because something kinda new killed 1000 dudes somewhere in mexico. No one gives a shit.<br>
<br>
I started seeing some asian people wearing paper masks in the metro, not sure if it helps.<br>
I also saw people wearing gasmask but that was at some fetish party, ill skip the details.<br>
<br>
Some radio stations are calling out the medical industry, questionning the whole <br>

Yes, the <span style="text-decoration:underline">intention</span> of surgical masks is for those who infected and home with the flu to no cough/sneeze and pass the pathogen on through airborne vector to those in their proximity. <br>
<br>
The mask will stop you from spreading it, not protect you.<br>
<br>
However the majority of those wearing like the man in the picuture are uninfected beleiving that teh mask they're wearing will afford them some protection as they walk around the street. that's the part i think it ironic...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

All that media spam and idiot straining for a virus that didnt even manage to pull off a 1000 person worldwide death toll in the end.<br>
<br>
To put that in perspective, over 1000 people will die in north america in the next 8 hours from heart disease alone. Sars didnt end up killing that many in the whole world over the course of an entire year. People dont needs masks, they need to step away from the fork.<br>
<br>
But of course the talking heads on tv are surely more accurate than hard facts, and itd be a damn shame if anyone were to actually learn from history, so i soon expect to see plenty of scared randoms in masks all over again.<br>

Right now all it seems is a random series of people getting sick(most likely for being in Mexico at the time then returning home before symptoms started to show. The media just keeps saying Pandemic, Pandemic and the like when we really don't know any hard data on the virus. <br>
<br>
All we really know is that its a flu, it originated in Mexico, its got the capacity to kill, its apparently spreading and can be transmitted human to human.<br>
<br>
What we DONT know is whats the incubation period of the virus, is it still contagious while its in incubation inside a human body, can it become airborn, how close do you have to be to someone infected with Swine flu for it to spread.<br>
<br>
It seems that governments are actually trying to nip this in the bud by implementing the masks outdoors for those infected and quarantining off parts. The question is will the general population be smart enough or will they make poor decisions based on the inflation the media is giving this virus?<br>
<br>
I don't know about all of you but I think common sense is a lot more rare these days..<br>

is this supposed to be a joke?  humor?  i must be missing something.<br>
<br>
CARACAS (Dow Jones)--Venezuela's pork industry is not exposed to the swine flu afflicting Mexico and the U.S., and no signs of the disease have been detected, Alberto Cudemus, the President of Venezuela's Pork Federation, said Monday.<br>
<br>
according to el presidente' for life, chavez, there is NO swine flu.  period.  end of story.  anything reported to the contrary is "irresponsible" reporting from the free press.  just ask his health minister.<br>
<br>
"the u.s. goverment decided it was ok to have a pork factory in venezuela"... wtf?  chavez decides what gets produced in venezuela.  not the u.s.  the only the u.s. gov could do is allow trade.  if chavez had the SLIGHTEST OPPORTUNITY to blame the u.s. he would be shouting it form the mountaintops.<br>
<br>
and wtf, do rivers somehow drain from venezuela into mexico?  is my geography that bad?<br>

Yes. There is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals.<br>
<br>
However, it is essential to cook meat properly. A temperature of 70C (158F) would be sure to kill the virus.<br>
<br>
Experts are also stressing that this is now a disease which is being passed between people.<br>
<br>
The World Organisation for Animal Health said culling pigs, as Egypt has proposed, was therefore "inappropriate" as a measure to stop swine flu spreading.<br>
<br>
It added there was no evidence of infection in pigs, nor of humans acquiring infection directly from pigs. </div></blockquote>

Hint: If it was due to dumping in a river it would have been a waterborne virus by now and A LOT more people would be infected.<br>

Most infections right now have been proven to be human to human transfer.<br>

Our party is going to the shitter mainly because of those that think the same way as you.

LOL Really?<br>
<br>
The US HAS ruled other countries AND conquered as well. <br>
Puerto Rico was forced under US control and they immediately forced a military government for over 15 years. Only AFTER those 15 years did we get a chance to vote for who would lead our country and even then it wasn't until the 1930's what we had complete control over that. Theres still plenty of people that want independence from the states in Puerto Rico.<br>

i dont entirely agree with you Sac.  i feel like the GOP has abandoned its conservative principles.  not just in theory, but in actuality.  the expansion of government from Bush II began with the creation of DHS and ended with the birth of TARP.  it was just bewildering and disappointing to watch.  GOP leadership is lost.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Who cares? The flu itself kills over 200,000 people a year. This thing is like a pimple on the flu's ass. The swine flu, like many other things, is something the media is banking on for viewers. Live your life without fear people and please ignore our Vice President at all costs lol.<br>

They are called guidelines for a reason. Three strikes is for when people are flaming back and forth and it is just annoying stuff. If you go too far you can get banned instantly.<br>

perhaps you're worried banning certain ppl / or a wave of bans will kill the site? if that's the case i'm not judging you but i disagree: if anything, this site will only live longer if some kids here were kicked out. otherwise things are not looking too good in the near future. not sure if it's the moon, mercury's withdrawal or something in the water they drink but something's just not right lately.<br>
 GOOD JOB on the cleanups you and nino done in the 2v2 and dal's threads.<br>

They are called guidelines for a reason. Three strikes is for when people are flaming back and forth and it is just annoying stuff. If you go too far you can get banned instantly.<br>

Also, one mans troll is another mans joke...so I don't ban for silly posts unless it is blatant spam, or aimed at someone.</div></blockquote>

Reasons why I enjoy having WT as our Admin here. He isn't offended to easily, he knows when to ban someone. Enough said. Thanks WT for all your effort.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

"There has been a small outbreak of “zombism” in London due to mutation of the H1N1 virus into new strain: H1Z1.<br>
<br>
Similar to a scare originally found in Cambodia back in 2005, victims of a new strain of the swine flu virus H1N1 have been reported in London.<br>
<br>
After death, this virus is able to restart the heart of it’s victim for up to two hours after the initial demise of the person where the individual behaves in extremely violent ways from what is believe to be a combination of brain damage and a chemical released into blood during “resurrection.”<br>
<br>
The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the alert to phase six, its highest level, and advised governments to activate pandemic contingency plans.<br>
<br>
In Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak, President Felipe Calderon urged people to stay at home over the next five days."<br>
<br>
We need Bear Infantry to fight this Pussy Ass Swine Flu Zombism!!!<br>
Incinerate London to begin with. Forget all that 28 Days Later shit. Just bomb it, now!<br>
We must not take any chances and its just the British anyways! Who cares?!?<br>
Then we cleanse Canada (and no one even knows there IS a Country to our north anyways) and Use the Bear Infantry and make Mexico our buffer.<br>
Then we can concentrate on cleaning up the South down there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

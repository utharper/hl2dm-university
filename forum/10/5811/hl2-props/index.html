	<div class="content">Hey guys, not sure if I'll get a big response from this, but I'm just looking to see if anyone has any suggestions.<br>
<br>
So I went to my first Con ever a few weeks ago. It blew me away at how much fun it was, naturally I went as a Half Life 2 Rebel since I've been playing this game for over a year or so now maybe 2 off and on. I purchased a cheap mp7 airsoft gun and when I got to the Con they told me it needed an orange tip not a red one and that it can't be made from an airsoft gun.So they wouldn't let me walk around with it, (I pulled the gun out for pictures whenever I could tho) Pfft. I saw a ton of people walking around with airsoft guns too... Anyway, It just made me want to learn how to make my own SMG 1 from scratch that was pretty dam good looking. I would rather make my own with detachable orange tips so I can replace them with nice looking ones for pictures.<br>
<br>
So I was just wondering if anyone here has any experience making props? I'm sort of a perfectionist so I would like to get as close as I can. I don't have a lot of experience making any props, but I'm willing to give it a try and I don't give up easily. I've seen some (very few and rare) HL2 props online that are amazing. I've seen a few AR2's some pretty sweet SMG 1's, and a few crowbars made from scratch. <br>
<br>
Here are the Con rules:<br>
No airsoft guns (I'm sure if I mod the hell out of it or use it as a skeleton they wouldn't know.) <br>
No full metal parts (like I would just grab a crowbar and paint it, but it's considered a weapon)<br>
Must have a bright orange tip (I would like to figure out a way to have a removable orange tip I can swap out with a realistic looking one, that would be schweet).<br>
No laser sights (I guess I could do an RPG but I would have to cover up the laser if I did put one in there)<br>
<br>
I'm looking to make an AR2<br>
or<br>
a crowbar<br>
or<br>
an SMG1<br>
or some health packs/misc items from the game. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'll post some of the links I've found in my spare time looking around for this stuff online if this thread gets some kewl responses. I'm just curious if anyone has any experience on making props. Should I do papercraft? Should I use cardboard and paint it? What kind of paint should I use? How does one make molds for masks or other items? I've got those kinds of newb questions. <br>
<br>
If I do get some responses here I'll make sure to update everyone on the progress with lots of pictures and how I did it so you guys can do it too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nice, thanks guys! While I was on youtube I found these two guys making replica AR2's. I'll check this out. Looks like I'll have to pick up some tools/paint before I get started.<br>
<br>
This kid made one out of cardboard:<br>

Yea for sure! I plan on starting the project in July, I'll be ordering paints and a few parts to start off with. I've seen some sick props made by others online, I hope I can come close to what they have done. I'll make sure to post progress pics here!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Update, okay I was out of town for a while, just got back this week, I've had these items for a few weeks now, but here is an update.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the stuffz I've got. (I hope you have a large monitor for these pics, I've already scaled them down lol)<br>
<br>
I've purchased some bondo, some hardener, sandpaper (80 grit, 100 grit, &amp; 150 grit), bummed some cardboard box tops off of a school, and am reusing a few cereal/cracker boxes from around the house along with some tools I had lying around the house.<br>

I'm off to wallymart to pick up a glue gun. The main thing I'm missing (at the moment) is a cheap airsoft/toygun. That has a skeleton similar to the AR2 used in this video: <br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T2i6qzq" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T2i6qzq</a> ... ll&amp;list=WL (EDIT! CRAP! Looks like the video was taken down for copyrighted music, however I downloaded it ahead of time. Here are some pics of the gun from the youtube video. Ask me for more if u need em)<br>
<br>

<br>
So I DO NEED SOME HELP <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> If you guys could help me find something on Amazon or Evike or anywhere online for a cheap gun that is similar to the one in the above youtube video so I can use it as a skeleton for the AR2 that would be SWWEEEET! I'm actually not even sure what type of rilfe he is using in the video(the guy who made the video did a great job on the prop, but a poor job of explaining exactly what he used). Any help would be welcome! So far I've spent about $23.30. If you guys can help find a cheap under $30 (or even under $10!) gun that would really help out, I'm prolly going to rush shipping a bit too lol. Thanks ahead of time, I look forward to seeing how this turns out. Any questions? Go ahead and ask meh. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dunno...some very narrow minded peeps in this online world...guess they'll always be "noobs"...sad really<br>

Are you afraid that if you play without bunny hopping, you actually suck and can not hold your own in the game? <br>
<br>
I think that is the case: without using your game flaws, you would get your butt kicked. You can't play without them, because you don't have the skillset to hold your own without the use of scripts/flaws.</div></blockquote>

It DOES matter that it's within the expectations of the game engine, it's why they are NOT "flaw-techniques". In fact, if they were flaw-techniques, they wouldn't BE within the expectations of the game engine, indicating a flaw.<br>
<br>
That said, the server owner is totally within his rights to make it a rule that advanced techniques aren't allowed.<br>
<br>
And yes, you are right, if we don't like that rule, we should play somewhere else... Which is the whole point of this thread! The point of this thread is to warn others NOT play there, in a server with such rules, which is apparently "the whole point of your response(s)"! It seems rather redundant to come here and tell us not to go in that server if we don't like it, when the thread is to warn others not to go there because we wouldn't like it....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The rules are displayed when you enter, don't you ever read them? Is it wrong for him to ban those who don't obey the rules? He gives them several chances, as he did with Panic. Panic kept bunnyhopping and asking 'why? why? why?' like a 3 year old.<br>
<br>
I entered a sever one time that said if I changed my username to put THEIR klan name at the front of my name, they would ban me. So if I changed my name and did it anyways, and they banned me, would they be in the wrong? No.. because I disobeyed their rules.<br>
<br>
At least this Sub_Genius guy gives you a couple of chances to stop the game-flaws before he finally has to do something about it. He gave panic several chances.. finally Sub and the other guy gave up and waited patiently for Panic to leave of his own free will.<br>
<br>
Besides Sub_Genius is a nice guy, another guy came in while I was there today and plainly ASKED to be banned, so he quickly did as the guy so politely requested.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They ARE flaws. Tricking the system into thinking you are part of an object, then climbing up a wall that clearly has no ladder, IS cheating.

agreed 100%<br>
Taking it a step further, he can ban whomever he wants for absolutely no reason.<br>
There's a reason why casual gamers greatly outnumber the HL2DMU and the competitive community as a whole. You're just being ignorant if you assume that everybody will enjoy the game more by learning advanced skills. <br>
Don't get what you want. Throw a fit. Send in cronies to grief the server and do exactly what you did. Maybe if you get lucky he'll shut the server down and move on to a different game. Would that make you happy Paradox?<br>

<br>
Bunnyhopping is not a flaw of the game, if it weren't meant to be implemented why did the programmer bring all velocities up to match up to, and create the source engines perfect strafe jump?<br>
<br>
Why did they not code against it during the update that was exclusively for the FIOS grand tourney, and the number of updates before that one? It's obviously simple for them to do it look how fast they implemented anti bunnyhopping code to team fortress 2.<br>
<br>
Bunnyhopping in deathmatch is the norm, it's mandatory and the server you play on is no where near the intended state of the game. As far as phys jumping goes I could care less if it's allowed or not because clearly it's not meant to be part of the game, but for you to sit here and try to tell me bunnyhopping in a deathmatch game is a glitch is fucking stupid.<br>

As I have already said, if he would have just stated that they dont want bunny hop, etc there instead of calling me a cheater and a scripter, I would have left and it would have been no problem.  I have been told this on other servers and I have left with no issues.  Its this guy's attitude that irritated me.    He didnt behave like the "reasonable guy" his friend claims him to be.  In fact he was rather rude about it.    And yea I wanted to warn people here that this is a server that they are not welcome on.  He runs maps that some people here like so they could, like I did, go into the server.  <br>
<br>
Yea I didnt read the MOTD.  Does everyone here read the MOTD of EVERY server they enter?  I try to but sometimes I just want to play and I forget, especially if the server doesnt have spawn protection.<br>

I have run many pubs and I do realize that people dont play video games to read.  When someone was doing something we didnt like, we would just tell them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was like 37-3 and the three kills were afk kills and another one was some random rpg kill.

ok now this i totally disagree with, this is like going to the aborigines, taking all of thier knowledge, tools, way of life and replacing it with our own just because we percieve it to be "inferior". No if they want to play the game how they want who are you to stop them? Hows about you go into all the puzzle and rp servers and take out all their maps and replace them too... build servers? Now they are aware of advance techniques they may come for assistance but otherwise leave them alone, it's his server and Valves game yes they wanted bhopping but not everyone has to do it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not sure if ur actually saying anything there or an attempted joke failed XD<br>
But pressing the grav button +attack/+attack2 = simple.

Intent, simply by observing how things work in a game u can see wat is and wat isnt suposed to be.<br>

I can confirm it, since I recall reading that specific post, but I would be surprised if anyone actually took screenshots of the FIOS forums.

<br>
I still have the demo of Dirk, modal and I play testing the beta before the update  With CPL|Chris,  he was talking with me in irc a bunch asking questions about that valve had asked him.  Valve told him to have the community send a bunch of demo's of the various techniques.  <br>
<br>
Fast weapon switch, fast shotgun, b-hopping, grav-jumping, fast-orbing, slamming under items, Ggun scrolling , holding an item behind a wall, g-nading.  While STa had it's own rules against some of these things valve decided what to keep and take out.<br>
<br>
Funny thing was, the update completely screwed hit reg for a good month or so once it came out with stv and match system.<br>

wtf you can't lead that far, even if you were just walking you could change directions and the model/avatar wouldn't do the change until a full second later.<br>

<br>
We can't be talking about the same thing.   The update right after they released beta was bad.  PiC made a video (doubt it is still up) showing the hitboxes.  When the hitboxes went to do a jump they would land before the model would even start the jump.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

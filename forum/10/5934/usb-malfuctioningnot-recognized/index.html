	<div class="content">Alright, so I'm having a big issue with plug and play devices in Windows 7. Things that shouldn't be happening.<br>
<br>
I plug in my razer death adder mouse. It will sometimes say. "Windows is trying to find the driver."...."The driver can not be found." Other times, it will say "USB Device not recognized..etc" I've included that error in the picture link below. I insert a plug and play keyboard, same error. I select a thumb drive.. Nothing. External hard drive? Nope. All of these devices work on my netbook with windows 7 starter. <br>
<br>
I search these errors on google. People on other forums say to go to device manager, uninstall all usb hubs, turn off the computer, unplug the psu, unplug all USB devices, turn the computer back on, then plug in the USB devices and the driver will be found again. Okay, so I did that a couple of times. 10% of the time it will work. Just for kicks, I'll keep all the USB devices plugged in and restart the computer. Same error. <br>
<br>
That was just the start.. Next I reformatted. I needed to do it anyways. The last time i formatted was when windows 7 came out. I transferred all my files onto my external hard drive through my netbook via ethernet cord. Then I reformat. The mouse and keyboard which were USB worked for a bit. I restarted and they broke (again). <br>
<br>
Then I thought I might've needed a new power supply. Maybe the mouse and USB keyboard weren't getting enough power. Again. They. didn't. work.<br>
<br>
My dad thought steam was the issue when I reformatted. He said steam might have given me a virus or malware.  I told him no, but he said to format again anyways. I did it. Still the same exact issue, a second(third, fourth, fifth?) time. <br>
<br>
I googled more and they said to update the chipset drivers as they usually contain the USB drivers as well. I downloaded the latest and greatest drivers from Intel, and again, to no avail. I downloaded the drivers for my razer mouse, installed, restarted, again, nothing.<br>
<br>
This is getting ridiculous. <br>
Google is no luck. People on microsoft forums won't provide any answers to the problem. I've run out of options.<br>

	<div class="content">The problem is, this could be a lot of things.  To one of the four USB connectors not being tightened on your MOBO to, the MOBO being defective/shitty, bad mouse/keyboard (I doubt it's this, but always, try other input peripheral).  Windows 7, out of the box, no updates, should have NO problems with a Death Adder.  Hey, I have one in a box over there in my closet, and it works fine.<br>
<br>
Checklist:<br>
  Update Motherboard Drivers<br>
  Check all USB connections plugged into your motherboard.<br>
  Goes without saying, but try plugging your mouse into different USB slots, and try different mice.  (This really should be the first thing you do.)<br>
<br>
Finally, what's the history of this motherboard/computer.  Have you used it before and been fine?<br>
<br>
edit: and oh yea, don't touch your mobo without you discharging any static electricity from yourself and shutting off your psu (via the back switch)<br>

It seems to me that the issue is either software related to the motherboard or the motherboard itself saying "Fuck this, I'm out" i.e. slowly dying.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have updated the motherboard drivers off the Intel website. If by check connections you mean to make sure they are plugged in all the way, I've done this multiple times. The problem is not specifically with the mouse. NO USB works in any slot. I've tried plugging in a plug and play flash drive, USB keyboard, external hard drive, a plug and play mouse and none of them work.<br>
<br>
Yes, I have used the motherboard before. Up until two weeks it worked fine. Then I get these errors, then the USB worked again, then I restart it and it doesn't.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

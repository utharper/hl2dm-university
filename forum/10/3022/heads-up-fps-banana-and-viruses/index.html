	<div class="content">Ugh.  This new Virtumonde is pretty sinister.  I was only able to clean it by booting from CD and editing the registry with the hard drive in slave-mode.  That finally killed Virtumonde, but so far I've run SpybotS&amp;D, Ad-Aware, Avira, and Malwarebytes AM and each one finds different crap leftover.<br>
<br>
And to top it off, my system makes an audible error chime about a half-hour after boot.  Yeah, that isn't disconcerting at all.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"><br>
<br>
Yeah, Adblock probably saves you from these drive-by infections, so it's a good first line of defense, but definitely upgrade java and Acrobat, because the root security defect is otherwise still there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you actually have an infection, and the anti-spyware programs don't seem to be removing it, here's what I did to kill one of the variants:  <a href="http://bbayles.googlepages.com/antivundo.html" class="postlink">http://bbayles.googlepages.com/antivundo.html</a><br>
<br>
I had to follow the "If the files wouldn't rename or delete" section, and then had to reboot and move/delete the files by hand... MoveFile didn't seem to actually delete them.  That works if the variant you have is the one that hooks into the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run registry key.  You'll know it's there if there's a value that says "rundll32 \windows\system32\&lt;random junk&gt;.dll"  The &lt;random junk&gt; part will match the dlls that you found while following the directions in that page.<br>
<br>
There's another variant that's a whole shitload tougher to remove.  It will show up in the ListDlls list, but MoveFile won't help at all.  PM me if you need help.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's free and basically I run this about once a month creating a backup image of my registry or after doing any major updates/additions ect. When things like this malware screw up your registry you simply can run Erunt to rewrite your registry to the last good save you have, if you are vigilant about doing it often its very nice to have. The program also comes with NTregop a nice little registry optimizer, which I also use about once a month.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm no expert in this area, but it is my understanding that when you visit a site if that site has any java script running on the page, it is possible for malicious code to be contained within that java script. Java keeps updating to try to prevent this but it seems people keep finding ways around it. I never realized how much java script is being used out there until I started running no-script, and seeing how many things it was preventing from displaying or working. At first you will be thinking to your self this is a pain in the ass, every site I go to I have to manually ok things for it to work, but then you get to the point where you are asking your self is it really needed to see all of this site of just what is important to me, and you selectively ok things as needed (if you trust the site, like this one).

The website contains a java applet that, using one of javas many security holes, gives itself admin level permissions and edits the users winlogon and select other files, which then open the door for the trojan to be automatically downloaded.<br>
<br>
Disabling scripting of java applets obviously foils this particular malware, but tbh so many users allow automatic scripting of applets, running / dling of activex controls, installation on demand or no prompt for file / font downloads, that its no surprise at all that people are constantly getting hit with driveby malware infections.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ko-Tao is right.  I've seen it happen with a Java exploit, and this last one was an Acrobat exploit.  I only noticed it because Acrord32.exe suddenly started up while I was browsing maps on FPS banana and I had Java disabled.<br>
<br>
The "root-cause" security defect is in Java or Acrobat itself, and maliciously crafted jar or pdf files can exploit those defects to run arbitrary code (install viruses, download more stuff, rootkit, basically do anything).<br>
<br>
The key is if Java or Acrobat are enabled as web browser plugins, and the browser automatically runs embedded applets or Acrobat files, then there's a risk of drive-by infection.  By default, I know that Firefox won't even prompt you.  It'll just load jar or pdf files, fat-dumb-and-happy, even if it comes from a site's advertiser.<br>
<br>
So it's not actually just simply browsing the site, it's also the loading of less-than-secure plugins and automatic d/l and running of embedded media.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

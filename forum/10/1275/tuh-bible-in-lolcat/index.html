	<div class="content">because he is a realist Vermonter like me. No disrespect to you religious foke but in this day in age its kinda sad that there is still religion, at least in industrialized countries with such a strong grip on science, that is hard to believe that people still believe in it. And its scary that the people in charge of our country are some of the most hardcore religious fanatics of them all.<br>
<br>
for example... you either believe in evolution,dinosaurs or the big bang theory , or "god" not both, now ask your self, which do you believe in.<br>
<br>
religion was established as a way for a better way of living, either it was back in the polytheistic days for crop, a way of order (todays law) or just comfort of death ( idk maybe them jihads? hahaha jK!) but like i said, science is the biggest influence on the world these days and has been for a long time. While most of the ridiculous stuff in the bible for example is just a story to provide hope or blah blah blah, the rest of it has been completely dis proven by science.<br>
<br>
since i was raised in a some what religious family it was always there. While i was allways skeptical of the whole thing it wasnt untill my 9th grade history teach (mr dean ian hahaha the man!) but he said that out of the first monotheistic religions (Judaism's,Christianity and Islam) out of these monotheistic religions ONE GOD! and thats it, either... one of them is the only true one...Judaism since they were here in all fairness first.  or there is no god at all.<br>
<br>
He also talked about how either "god" or the people who started it are both some crazy mother fuckers ( which imo they were tripping on rotten yeast in the bread like the witch craft days hahahaah) but.. these ppl or god or w.e are telling each other to go and kill the other religion cause there... bad? or what not idk but either way... god is 1 fucked up person  or the ppl interpreting it are just as fucked up.. <br>

	<div class="content">Bahlk and I are of like minds when it comes to this subject.  why you might ask?  Well its simple we got drunk, stoned and tripped a lot with each other.  What do you do when you are all of those things?  You consider things in this world that really don't make sense.  One recurring theme was religion.  Now you see me posting about Christianity primarily because that is the one that effects us most here in the good'ol US of A.  <br>
<br>
But in general I believe, Religion is an archaic institution which has FAR out lived its usefulness.  It now serves as nothing more than a societal crutch.  Science now has the ability to define what we don't understand, which was religions primary function, provide answers to the unexplainable to make people more comfortable.  People are afraid of what they don't understand, I believe religion EVOLVED out of this idea.  Provide something to alleviate mans inherent timidity towards things which he does not understand and you greatly improve his ability to survive.  It also provides a power well to whom ever sees this and chooses to exploit it.  Religion, now that we have science to give us objective answers regarding what we don't understand, really only remains as a weakness to humans as a species.  That sums up my thoughts on religion in general, not just Christianity, the IDEA of religion.<br>
<br>
I know some people may find this hard to believe, but I really don't come out saying this to try and offend anyone.  I can't be anymore truthful when I say that, I respect ones choice to believe in what makes sense to them.  I regard religion as the scourge, not the people choosing to believe in its many representations.  There are INNUMERABLE things that can be learned from the religious beliefs of the world, I just think we take it all WWWWAAAAAAYYYYYYY too seriously.  <br>

Its better not to beleive in any one thing, i like quantum mechanics as it forces u to think deeper into the subject and brings up alot of interesting facts and theories.<br>
I have a theory that stems from the theory of unity, basically we are all of the same consciousness which is that of the universe, it separates our minds with the subconcious but through our subconciousness is where we get our instincts, and how things evolve. Basically all life would be, if that were true, is a universal consiousness constantly trying to come into the physical realm. <br>
In the end though, its just a theory, i dont change my life in any way because of it. Though it does make more sense then christianity XD<br>
And i have to say, the universe is an extremely complex place, to simplify it or speek in absolute terms about it IS philisophically retarded, hence why i say that about religion, ALL RELIGION.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Agreed, in the grand scheme of things, how can there be right and wrong in such complexity.<br>
Societies dictate wats right and wrong, good or bad, and those vary in all societies/cultures. And im not saying that ppl should just do wat they want, i think a form of philosophical enlightenment should be tought to all kids in school, so wen they grow up they can just do wats logical, logic = peace.<br>
<br>
It makes u think though, the chemical reactions that take place in our brains, are they only there to force us to do some other entities biddings, is it all simply a test, experiment, or is it something even more complex then that and there is no other consciousness involved.....difficult. In my opinion, high levels of emotion (the chemicals that make them) are wat causes ppl to act irrationally, in most cases anyways. Once u have control and logic u are set.<br>

Hey, that's utter bullshit! I'm living proof, if nothing else, being a scientist and an atheist.<br>
The idea you are describing is also flawed. Life didn't arise by mere coincidence, but by the driving force of natural selection. Also, if you defer the explanation of life and the universe to some kind of higher being, you are still left with the question as to what/who created that being. So in reality it doesn't explain anything. I recommend everyone to read "The God Delusion" if you want a deeper understanding and more detailed explanation why nothing supernatural exists.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Let's just say that the situation that gives rise to life is really improbable. But, how many planets can there be in the universe with similar conditions? Quite a few I'd imagine, so if you multiply the probability with the number of "experiments" the resulting figure might not be so improbable. In fact, even if only one of those planets gave rise to life, that place would be right here by definition since we are here discussing it, right?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thats right, now juts continue some deep breathing while you rerad this post, lets lower our blood preasures a littel shall we? This is a tough subject to get through without harsh words, I know, its the very nature of this debate to get a little hot under the collar. We are talking about beliefs, lets not forget this, things near and dear to what makes people....them. A delicate subject to say the least, but please if we're going to have this debate lets have it for the sake of sharing ideas not proving someone else wrong or anything of the sort. Even if one does not agree with a decenting opinion, striving to understand it regardless of that fact is the only way to broaden your understanding of the subject itself. So then it seems prudent for eveyone to consider...well everyone and when writing posts please do try to be civil, generalizations are going to happen, people will write things in haste, and concepts won't be fully thought through. This is a great discussion but if it starts to turn for the bad im having it locked asap. no more back and forth, your wrong im rirght, you contradicted yourself here here and here, chat log this chat log that...blah poopy gnar gnar. AKA-Not in my fucking hijacked thread! Sry BI I'm claimin it shes all mine. lol</div></blockquote>
That's why... this subject is not to be speaken in a haste and all you said. And as I said before, I don't plan to BUMP this more (even though I somehow did), cuz no one will change the mind of anyone, and I highly DOUBT something good is gonna come from this disscusion.<br>

Others believe that there "superstition" has grounds in fact, or does not need grounds in fact in order to be true.  This debate doesn't function well on absolutes.  Its true I was idealisticly hoping that we could a fun debate about some of the more profound philisophical questions and conundrums we as humans have been trying to answer since the beginning of time.  to be entirely to cliche, The desination is not whats important, its the journey.<blockquote><div><cite>Cynips wrote:</cite>Let's just say that the situation that gives rise to life is really improbable. But, how many planets can there be in the universe with similar conditions? Quite a few I'd imagine</div></blockquote>  This certainly raises the probability of life anywhere in the universe.  The universe is gigantic, it contains millions if not billions of galaxies, which can contain billions of stars, which makes for even more orbital bodies surrounding those stars.  This leave us with many trilions of chances for life to occur, making the proability of it happening <em class="text-italics">anywhere</em> in the universe, nearly inevitable.  I belive that that model alone is enough to rule out the idea that there HAD to be a greater being in the works.  Not only does that explain how we are here, but it also says to me that we are most likely not the only ones pondering such ideas.  It would seem to be highly improbable that we are the only cosmic variance able to percive our own existance.  Is that the extent of what classifies something as having the condition we refer to as life?  Being able to percieve ones existance?  How can something BE prior to existance?  What is nonexistance? Does it exist?  Am I capable of percieving nonexistance?<br>
<br>
Then once you add in the idea from quatum physics that we are everything and nothing, simultaneously, this whole idea of life, existance and nonexistance gets even more thoroughly complicated.  I tired to explain this idea but I can't write coherently enough to have it make sense lol.  This principle is very clearly illustrated in the movies, "What the Bleep Do We Know?" and "Down the Rabbit Hole."  Both of thses movies do an amazing job of simplifying and explaining most of the really influencial principals from quantum mechanics and quantum physics.  Extremely intriguing, and some of the scientists they interview are very interesting characters.  "Down the Rabbit Hole" is the sequal to "What the Bleep Do We Know."  I highly suggest these movies, extremely intriuging, and vastly informative.  I have not looked at the world the same since I saw them lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Interesting discussion.<br>
<br>
I am also a scientist, and I was brought up with in a very religious household.  What I state here is meerly my point of view and not intended to incite a riot.<br>
<br>
I do believe there is some "higher intellegence" that has guided things. While I do believe that natural selection occurs, I do not believe that humans evolved from apes.  There still is no proof of the missing link.  Seems to me that if humans did evolve from apes, we would have found at least one specimen somewhere that bridges that gap.  To say that religion is a fabrication by people to explain the unexplainable because science couldnt do it I think is a bit of a disservice.  Someone would have had to have one hell of an imagination in order to come up with the ENTIRE old testament.  How do you explain the Shroud of Turin?  Scientists have studied it, they can offer no scientific explaination for it.  Also if you look at religion around the world, there are many commonalities among the different ones that goes beyond coincidence.   I cant remember specific examples, but scientists have found evidence and explainations for things they could not explain in the bible itself, rather than the other way around (ie science explaining events in the bible).  One of them had to do with errors in the calender if I remember correctly.<br>
<br>
My issue with religion is that some factions (for lack of a better term) have used religion as a means to oppress others.  The fault doesnt lie in the religion itself, but with the people who implement it that way.  I take exception to modern religious leaders using religion as a means to garner money from their followers and then live extravagant lives.  Not that they should live in destitution, but they shouldnt live in a home that rivals Bill Gates' mansion.  Because of that I dont subscribe to any one particular religion or church and simply call myself a Christian that believes in the bible, and not subject myself to any particular faction's spin on it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Hehehe your so right Pernicious, its just a big jumbled mess of ideas.  But I disagree, and yet I also agree. (ill explain) Religion is a very pertinant consideration in this day and age when disussing, scientific theories and philosophical ideas, because I think you must realize to what extent that persons perceptions are guided by relgious beliefs.  Granted any good scientist will try and remain as objective as possible for as long as possible, his ideas still will be effected to some extent by his beliefs, be them in religion or in logic.  And yet I also agree that religion really muddies the waters when you are trying to make sense of the things we have been discussing.  Having said that I think its safe to say that more and more people are coming to the same conclusion as our species matures.  Now that we have science to answer our questions one of the only things still holding religions place in the world, is peoples need/desire/compulsion to have something which is greater than them.  It is too far of a stretch for them to think what we experience could not have arisen from something so cold, logical, and devoid of mystic elements as probability.  Thats why people love to gamble so much, we are a proverbial jackpot one could say.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I believe there is a higher being, yet I can't pinpoint which one. How can somebody do this with so many beliefs? There's too many religions to pick just one until I can completely believe in one (which I probably don't have enough faith for). I'll stay atheist. <br>
<br>
I actually grew up in a pretty religious family too, but I don't think they actually believed in God. I just think they thought that they were suppose to. They had me to go a christian school from 2-6th grade. It doesn't even matter to anyone at that age about gods and whatnot. What's the point? I tried to "accept jesus into my heart." I asked for forgiveness for my sins and stuff and I never felt any different. I tried twice and nothing different. Well, I'm 17 now and I can decide for myself. There's people around me that are complete christians and they want me to accept jesus into my life. Well, if I tried twice and nothing changed, what's going be different this time. I do believe things happen for a reason and sometimes I do feel like someone is looking out for me. Now whether that is Jesus or not. I don't know. <br>
<br>
I kinda agree with the bible being too big for someone to just write and sometimes it is pretty gruesome. I also can't believe if we are in 2008 bc, that after 2008 years the apocalypse still hasn't taken place. <br>
<br>
In conclusion, I need good solid truth that this has happen. It's like telling someone to believe that there are aliens. They have 90132842 arms and 345983 legs and if you don't believe in them. You're going to hell. Yeah, sure, there are some facts that mean the bible is more true than that. But I'm not going to believe them because someone tells me to. It would be pretty scary though to live in Hell forever.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nice post Paradox, thats the type of idea sharing I was trying to insight in this thread, thank you.  I would like to comment on one of your remarks in particular.  "Also if you look at religion around the world, there are many commonalities among the different ones that goes beyond coincidence." -Paradox  I'm going to have to be a little vague because I don't rememeber some of the specifics, like which eastern religion the people I will be referring to practiced, or what tribe of native americans a certain belief comes from.  There is a very eerie similarity between a very specific native indian beliefs and tibetan belief.  Both of these people believed that if they did not meditate in specific locations around the globe that the balance of the earth would fall apart.  Both sects seperated by thousands of miles of land and and water know that if their fellows of the other side falter, or if they themselves falter, there will be consepences that effect the world.  One would think that these two groups of people would have to have comunicated to have wound such an intertwined and interdependant fate.  The Cherokee indians also used a single blue bead to represent the earth...how did they know the planet looks like a blue ball from space?  It looks mostly green, or brown from the surface.  Though they believe that humans fell from the stars of a galaxy, so many it was on their cosmic journey that their ancestors was the earth from a far as a blue ball.  Its things like those two examples that really make me wonder about the whole "we only use 10% of our brain" theory.  Maybe we have somehow lost some extraordinary cognitive ability that our ancestors were able to tap into.  Could it be that we have become so jaded, that we can no longer understand what is probable and possible?  One question leads to another which leads to another which leads to an idea which need to be clarifieds, which once clarified leads to another question.  I also love how these debates always end up being hopelessly cyclical, things you say in regards to a certain idea will most likely also pertain to a previously discussed idea.  Its like a building proscess of expression, discussion and revision; leading to great undertsanding of things.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

btw, something useful:<br>
<br>
THE QUESTION OF BELIEF IS BINARY<br>
1. Theist- Holds a positive belief in a diety<br>
2. Atheist- Does not<br>
<br>
THE QUESTION OF KNOWLEDGE IS ALSO BINARY<br>
1. Gnostic- Knows that there is/is not a god.<br>
2. Agnostic- Does not know, or does not believe it is possible to know, if there is a god or gods.<br>
<br>
<br>
AGNOSTICISM COMES IN MULTIPLE LEVELS<br>
1. Weak Agnostic- Lacks knowledge of a god.<br>
2. Strong Agnostic- Believes that it is impossible to know whether or not there is a god.<br>
<br>
ATHEISM AND AGNOSTICISM ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE<br>
1. Knowledge and belief are independent.<br>
<br>
THEREFORE YOU HAVE, WITH THESE TWO VARIABLES, THESE COMBINATIONS<br>
1. Weak Agnostic Atheist- Lacks knowledge and belief in a god.<br>
2. Strong Agnostic Atheist- Believes it is impossible to know there is a god, and lacks belief in that god.<br>
3. Gnostic Atheist- Knows that there is no god and does not believe.<br>
4. Weak Agnostic Theist- Lacks knowledge of a god, yet believes in a god on faith, without evidence.<br>
5. Strong Agnostic Theist- Believes it is impossible to know whether or not there is a god, and believes that this god exists.<br>
6. Gnostic Theist- Knows there is a god and believes.<br>
7. Denying Atheist- Knows there is a god, yet does not believe.<br>
8. Denying Theist- Knows there is no god, yet believes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

For instance paganistic usages are spread all over the religions. Stuff like trinity, eastern, xmas, hell, a livin on soul, using pictures or effigies for worship, all this stuff emanates from paganistic. <br>

My mother told the pastor that Jesus Christ never wore pants and that when the pastor started to wear a dress all the time then she would. ROFL.

I guess not many people watch the discovery channel, this is very true. There is a huge amount of proof that it is, as it was written,and there are people who have spent their entire lives uncovering that proof.

It doesnt say this anywhere it only says that you should live your life after it and why? Because its good for you. At this point i dont mean the religious fanatics who just missinterpret or missunderstand by intention to support their position.

I would say right now, our society is struggling to move forward philisophically, and not even mainly because of religion, u just have to look at how small minded the average person is, beleiving everything they read in the news or see on television, obsessing over celebrities, crappy music thats lasts no longer then a peice of chewing gum, etc<br>

	<div class="content">While i dont automatically disrespect religious people, what cynips says about it being similar to believing in faeries or santa is pretty much true, and accordingly im always at least a bit suspect of anyone who still has an imaginary friend/enemy once their age hits double digits.<br>
<br>
Regarding the missing link- this is true, theres zero proof we evolved from apes, and a transition species has yet to be found either alive or in fossil form (and at this point, its pretty likely that such a thing never will be found). Going even further, theres the problem of the big bang theory, or rather, what existed before it and/or what caused it in the first place. However, the sane answer to this question isnt to react in fear/ego and dream up some sort of cosmic bang-maker or whatnot, its to react in humility/wisdom, accepting that theres a great deal more research to be done on the subject and that we simply dont have the answer yet.<br>
<br>
Life itself is also a problem question, as while its easy to see its origins in some ways, weve made zero progress in figuring out why it originates, or what its purpose is. Since its probably safe to assume the purpose isnt just to madly move various bits of matter from place to place until the life dies again, its likely that we have plenty more research to do here as well- which likely also ties in with whatever spawned the big bang, though of course thats not a guarantee either.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the bible could have easily been dreamed up by someone with a fervid imagination. The chronicles of thomas covenant, buried for a millenia and dug up by fearful people of great ignorance and questionable judgement, could easily be taken as a bible- history of the promised land, fated battles of good vs evil, the trials of the savior etc. They might even have "heretics" that question whether or not it was just a product of someones imagination, and the heretics would be right: stephen r donaldson has a fine imagination, and doesnt much resemble god so much as he does a successful author. He manages alot more cohesion and clarity than the bible as well, and a much better background- the creator is better than god, lord foul is badder than satan and andelain is utopia to the garden of edens vegetable patch.<br>
<br>
Basically, splicing bits of reality into a fantasia doesnt make the bible any more than exactly that: a fantasy novel loosely based on historical events. And in that respect, the covenant chronicles have the bible flat out beat.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>

BTW, there's much more than zero proof that we evolved from apes. Or rather, that we are a kind of ape. Don't forget that all the other great apes have evolved just as long as we have. We only like to think we are so special. It's not like the other apes stopped and we continued on with them as direct ancestors. Since we took different roads along the evolutionary pathway, we've certainly added on a bunch of more striking features than they have. And although the fossil record is kinda scarce, there's plenty of both morphological and molecular evidence speaking for our shared recent ancestry.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Cynips there's actually a study in 'Chromosome 2' that pretty much proves that we've decended from a common ancestor, 'evolution', (even though the proof is in logic imo)<br>
<br>
<br>
WIKI--
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Chromosome 2 is widely accepted to be a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral chromosomes. [2][3] The evidence for this includes:<br>
<br>
The correspondence of chromosome 2 to two ape chromosomes. The closest human relative, the chimpanzee, has near-identical DNA sequences to human chromosome 2, but they are found in two separate chromosomes. The same is true of the more distant gorilla and orangutan.<br>
<br>
The presence of a vestigial centromere. Normally a chromosome has just one centromere, but in chromosome 2 we see remnants of a second. [6] <br>
<br>
The presence of vestigial telomeres. These are normally found only at the ends of a chromosome, but in chromosome 2 we see additional telomere sequences in the middle.<br>
<br>
Chromosome 2 is thus strong evidence in favour of the common descent of humans and other apes. According to researcher J. W. IJdo:[7]<br>
<br>
We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome

One important question, if we didnt evolve from some kind of ape which evolved from something which evolved from a fish that crawled out of the sea which evolved from something which evolved from a single celled organism (excuse my simplistic example) then where the hell did we come from, like, modern day humans didnt just pop out of thin air, theres allways the theories about alien ancestors and being engineered an so on but even that would raise more questions if u took it seriously ^_^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

One thing is for certain though, if an alien race (yes even the <strong class="text-strong">possible</strong> 'creators' that dropped us off on this planet because they saw it was inhabitable) came here and looked around, saw that we're still at war, separated because of colors or language, they would totally disapprove of our behaviour as 'civilized' 'humans', we're this complex yet this much a unified FAIL.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, I remembered that when I read it. It's what I would call molecular morphology - the shape and form of the genetic moelcules so to speak. And although it is no logical proof, as empirical evidence you cannot find much more convincing stuff.<br>

Who wants to take this thread further than religion?  Our brains have become complex enough to leave our senses behind and imagine/experience new worlds where the impossible can be questioned for as long as we're conscious, and yeah I believe drugs had a major influence on most of the accepted beliefs now, take a look at everything without moral..

No but we have alot of information (imo) that states that we aren't a part of a big experiment, still though, a part of me WANT's us to be, it's a fun thought <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>

	<div class="content">@ Badinfluence  You remember the ending of Men in Black?  When the aliens are playing marbles and our entire universe is contained on just one marble of his collection.  Thinking about that idea really help to open my mind to the idea that we are incapable of completely understanding the nature of our existance.  Which is good because it leaves a little bit of wonder in this jaded world.<br>
<br>
@ Coke  Some native americans believe that all things have a spirit passing through them.  So essentially all things are alive and experiencing their existance in one way or another.  Humans were on the same level as rocks and trees and animals as far as they were concerned.  Part of the same spirit that runs through the stream, the rock, and the tree run through you aswell, making us all conected and essentially bound to the same fate.  Hence their extreme stewardship towards nature, they were as much a part of the cycle as the sun and the animals.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that there must be something else outside of our universe.  Scientists put a boundary on our universe, so am I to believe that there is a physical limit to our existance?  Can I bang on the edge like a pice of glass?  I mean can you really wrap your mindaround what nonexistance would look like?  Is there just a huge white/black void beyond our universe with absolutely nothing in it.  What would absolutely nothing look like?  Have you ever seen absolutely nothing?  Can absolutely nothing exist?  &lt;--- oxymoron but the heart of the question is intruiging and worth considering.  Wrap your mind around those questions and tell me that lump of flesh between your ears doesn't feel stimulated. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

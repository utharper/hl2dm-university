<br>
You can rake up the kills in a full killbox if you hit it right.<br>
<br>
I got 8 one night and the quakesounds went crazy.<br>

Isn't it seen as a negative to use the orb alot on lockdown?<br>
<br>
I was playing with some friends the other year (LOL) and some people were complaining when I was doing it.  My friends said that the orb was frowned upon in the "real" maps as the RPG is in killbox.<br>
<br>
If anybody is shooting one at you, pray there isn't something else around that you can pick up.  I more often than not get smg ammo or health instead of catching the orb. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Some think so, others disagree. Some players are known for their orbs, while others will bitch if they think you spam too much.<br>
<br>
"Play the map" is my philosophy. Most people I play have no problem with orbs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I can't say I have encountered an orb "whore"  all too often except for one time, I was running Steamlab on my server with a handful of people and one guy camped at the ammo crate full of orbs and did nothing but shoot orbs as fast as the gun would allow him.  Then, before the map ended, he had the balls to brag about how good he did compared to everyone else and he left.  He pissed off a few people after that but what can you do?  That was really the only time I felt there was some abuse, otherwise I could really care less because you can always counter attack!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL, I've been told that before, don't play Steamlab!!  I run it once in a great while, you would be surprised how many people connect when that map is running!!  I thought it was an OK map, fun to play, it was just that one time someone had to spam the  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">  out of the orbs, othewise no complaints.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, I know and I really didn't mean to be bragging about it either.  The only reason I pulled it off is that it was really and truly a server full of n00bs, myself included.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I am not sure if all of you are aware of a couple of people from our community that have decided to move on.<br>
<br>
[IWU] Zohar IMed me last week and said he was leaving the game.  There were various reasons that I wont go into here, but he decided he needed to do something else.  Zohar is a very good player and I always found him to be a pleasure to play with for a scrim partner and in general.  He never had a bad word to say to anyone and he was always a nice person to have around.  The community will miss him.  <br>
<br>
<br>
In addition, Khaos's own axeman has also decided he needs to spend more time on real life and family things.  Many of you have scrimmed with him on draft night, and played the game with him on our server and others.  We at Khaos are greatly saddened by his having to leave us, but we know that real life must take precedence.  We will miss him greatly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sounds to me like the people who need to make a change, as in, spending more time with family, getting some sun - simple enough!  Do those things, just cut down your time playing DM.  To quti completely is absolutely absurd!!  Have you heard of prioritizing your time?  It's a bummer these great players are quitting, but at the same time I wonder what is wrong with them that they can't work it out somehow.  Is it the bugs that's making them leave?  Deal with it!!  Every game has bugs of some sort, it's unfortunate but it happens.  As someone else mentioned above, I play more in the Winter than any other time just for the obvious reasons.  I too have family and other priorities but it all works out.  I would never quti playing this game for any reason.  The time spent playing may be reduced now and then but I will never leave this game!!  Sorry for the whining but that's my 2 cents worth, plus I feel like hammered shit today so that helped add a little fuel to the fire.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote><div><cite>CellarDweller wrote:</cite>Epoch has me confused with "slacklining". I'm thinking tightlining? Yanno, fishing.</div></blockquote>  Heh yeah thats not the first time I've been confused with an angler.  "Slacklining" as I refer to it is far closer to tight rope walking, but as the name implies the line is not "tight," it very elastic and wobbly while still taught enough to keep you fromm touching the ground when walking the line.  Most lines are made of 1" climbing webbing, which is a flat piece of tubular webbing which is very strong (tensile strength of 4000+ lbs.) and extremely flexible.  Usually when I setup a line it is about equal height with my arm pits at 50' long, and the line usually bows down like 1.5-2 feet as I walk it.  Its great fun, if no one has ever seen or tried it I HIGHLY suggest it, it feels so cool.  It can takes a couple days for some people to be able to stand for their first time, but once your there taking steps is far easier to learn.  The equipment is cheap too.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sadly HL2 Deathmatch is doomed and nothing can be done. The crashing is a property of the game and not a bug. It brings more excitement/randomness to the game ... it is like the weather in F1 (Formula). But seriously the game crashes too often, you can expect atleast one crash in 1-2 hours ... My vista just instructed me in germany that there is possible already a excisting fix to the problem (654th crash, managed to thumble and choose germany as the troubleshooting language and there is NO WAY to change it. NO WAY at all. )</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well, glad to read a lot of oppinions. Most of them advocate the group or the opinion.<br>
I am the founder of this group; first it was more or less a joke, but now we (the officers) have serious plans.<br>
Maybe some of you do not believe we can achieve something, but who knows? Let us give it a try! =)<br>
<br>
So thx for your support!<br>
And btw. we still need more officers! So, write me or one of the officers if you want to!<br>

try this web based link <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/STGHL?action=join" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/STGHL?action=join</a>, you may need to log in though.<br>

I guess this is duplicating the work done here, we hope to bolster the <br>
community effort displayed in here, but this group is only focused on one issue. <br>
I guess if we hope to prove our dissatisfaction by numbers, when the day comes it <br>
may seem clearer that our aims are something all 1xxxxx members want. <br>

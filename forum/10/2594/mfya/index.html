He's not a cool dude, hes completely annoying all the time. I re added him to friends when he added me, thinking oh maybe he's cool now, everyone's basically nice. Wrong. 15 minutes later in a match he was back to being just as big of an asshole. Also why would you think I'm talking to him like a css hacker? He doesn't hack and he is good at hl2dm.... ? He does act 15 though. Whats with you ghost dog? you used to be cool, now you're just like ruckus and all over his nuts...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, you're missing the humor in it.  There are people that get it, and people that don't.  You obviously don't, and therefore create more lulz.  <br>

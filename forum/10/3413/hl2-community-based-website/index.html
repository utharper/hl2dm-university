	<div class="content"><em class="text-italics">HL2DMU was founded on the principle that the community can work together to make the game better for all players. This means working together to facilitate and promote higher quality maps, cleaner servers, tougher competition, and more sportsmanlike behavior.<br>
<br>
HL2DMU is designed for all players with a good attitude, regardless of clan affiliation, skill level, play-style preference, and reputation.<br>
<br>
Although HL2DMU may initiate and host various projects, all work remains the property of it's respective authors, including videos, maps, plugins, software and all other contributions to the site. If you contribute to HL2DMU, full credit will be given wherever possible. HL2DMU is simply a vehicle for the community and has no interest in claiming credit for anything.<br>
<br>
If you want to show support for HL2DMU, simply show support for the HL2DM community. It is as easy as getting online, joining a server, and giving it your best without whining about how others choose to play the game. </em></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Plus, the purpose of a community site is to unite it and the HL2DMU site has been the most successful site in teaching and uniting groups in the ways of the game, other games, and stuff in general.<br>
In my opinion, besides steam forums, which would be an obvious choice for visitation, this has been the most successful site.<br>
Doubtfully many will not go to your site.<br>
HL2DMU has been a long term founded site around the time of the FIOS tourney at the games returned peak.<br>
It would be wiser to put forth your efforts here more then on your own site, because this community site is founded by the core of the gaming community and you wont waste your breath with a blank gawdy color wraught website.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No offense Bullock, but I dont understand why you are putting so much effort into a website for HL2 games.   Recall HL came out in 1998 and HL2 came out in 2004.   I dont think you can even find it in a video game store any more.   Pretty much if you own it now, you have played it at least twice (I think I have played it 3x).   I think I have played the episodes twice each.  There will be one more installment to the game: Episode 3 then in all likelyhood its going to be gone, dead.<br>
<br>
So.....pretty much no one needs tutorials for those games and if they are retarded enough to actually need a hint, there are TONS of websites that have walkthroughs.<br>
<br>
If you are going to put any HL2DM content up there, you are doing the game and this community a disservice.  It is small enough as it is why do you wish to split it further?<br>
<br>
Getting feedback is great, but based on what I have seen here, I dont see people from this crowd subscribing to your website, sorry.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

2 weeks?? you have got to be joking I learned to do more than that in what, 1 hour? Do you also live in one of those fantasy worlds, where in this case, you think you're James Bond or something along those lines?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I accidentally your website man, the <strong class="text-strong">whole</strong> website, I'm sorry! what do I do?<br>
<br>
Also, as Paradox said, there are already tons of walkthroughs for the HL single player games, HL1 is barely played, and the people that do still play it already know all about it, and they have their owns sites with tips and such. The only thing of value that COULD be added to your site would be HL2DM knowledge, and that's what the DMU is for, which makes your site pointless. The only thing it CAN do is, as pointed out, split our already small community. But I'm not worried, I honestly doubt anyone is going to split to go THERE.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi all <br>
All you can do is tit for tat all the time and it is not geting you anywhere my site will be a very good one once it is completed professionally.<br>
So keep it up if you wish but I will not go down that road to get into a slaging war all the time.  You can do as many posts as you like but I will not see them anymore as it is to much like school ground talk, he did this you did that hehehe <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
How come you say that my site is so bad  when other sites say well done.  I have a big list of all the nice comments about what will be a very friendly  community based website for all. My site will not be for people who just slag it off all the time but for nice people.<br>
So have fun on this post as you will be talking to yourselves not me from now on, as this is my last post.<br>
Have a great time.<br>

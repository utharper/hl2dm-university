Lmfao.<br>

I have too many to list but off hand it's probably the time I was playing ko-tao in cal on aim arena. He jumps out from behind one of the blocks on the ground to send an smg nade to the opposite side of blocks. I come around the corner to mag him and somehow I managed to shoot his nade before he even launched it. He ended up just exploding. It's in my "ninjins: back in the day" video I believe.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They stopped to record it , aforizm probably has it on demo.<br>

The other one was on Teto , where I shot him with two midair shots with the xbow before he falls to the ground.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you can't top that.<br>

I also did a 1v1 with poorbilly, i don't think i got any kills but the deal was every time you died you'd take a shot of vodka (me) or slam a beer (poorbilly, i think that's right, he's a whiskey kind of dude but that night i think he was drinking beer). Some one who wasn't in ewr, or EE, or WRW got a demo, no idea who it was but even though i get ass pounded through all of tigcrik i bet plenty of people would enjoy watching that. Later that night i puked up hotdogs all over my bathroom floor.<br>

Seriously though, the only reason i mention it is because i really, REALLY would like to see a demo, i don't remember shit of that night other than it happened and i want to relive it, so if you've got it let me know.

	<div class="content">Hm I dunno. I still like the overwatch RPG curve shot in my frag vid that goes from outside the xbow office, through the side door to the basement, and kills Ninjins at the stairs leading to the second level. What I should have shown was that later in the match he walked into the slam I placed in the office during that frag. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
I have done some nice xbow bounce shots too, but never managed to record any. One I recall was avalon. I was chasing punk but he got away from me, so I bounced a shot down the stairs from the second level inside and it ricocheted a few times, and went into the RPG room and killed him as he was running in.<br>

There was a RPG camper on overwatch, i was picking him off with mag and giving him general trouble for the whole game, and anyways, so i run around the front and see him up at rpg out the corner of screen, he immediatly hides behind the wall b4 i can get shot off, at that point u can only see the very tip of his head, then he takes a shot and goes to curve it down over the wall. So, i quickly grab a table from beside me and flick it as fast as i can up to rpg(full 180 degree fkick), and it goes over the wall and hits ......the very tip of his head. Was a funny one to me.

Well you know, the radiator hitting your toe would have crippled you anway. Your enemy would have just beat you senseless with the crowbar.  Might as well get it over with.

its pretty sad these days the level people goto to steal from other people...<br>
<br>
now...i known hooked personally for over 10 years..and i know hes not the sharpest knife in the drawer....but<br>
<br>
he got hijacked yesterday...<br>
<br>
not funny...someone sent him a link sayin that its steam's birthday and hewas selectedto win a couple games....to please click the link..<br>
<br>
and he did...<br>
<br>
soo....now..some european got his account and goin to all his friends askin them to click that link...so watchout...<br>

<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p</a> ... =10&amp;t=3396<br>
<br>
i see someone put a post already about this and a lot of shit is beint stirred up...<br>
<br>
thats not him...thats the phoney<br>
<br>
and now that if everyone reads that post and if they dont know by now...about the VAC banned status...<br>
<br>
both me and him have that on our records....and thats from before we started gaming hl2..thats from Condition Zero...<br>
<br>
lets settle this now...<br>
<br>
Before i even had a pc...i used to game at buddies house...and this is when i first started gamin on the pc...and he was big into CS, and CZ.....so thats what i started to play...and then my buddy found a hack...this was new to me..i never knew what this did or what consiquences it would bring me...so me and hooked being the noobs we are...we tried it....and we suffered...<br>
<br>
I see a lot of posts of people doubting his skills....and mine too...<br>
<br>
and too all those people they can go fuck theirselves because....that VAC banned status has been on our name before we even thought of creating [HCC]<br>
<br>
now its 3 years later and now we are getting shit for it?<br>
<br>
quotes from that link<br>
<br>
"it was like that before his account got hacked btw, I'm lol'ing not at his account being stolen and then vac;ed, but rather at him being a hacker and merlyn saying hes a good guy"<br>
<br>
"Yeah I've played with hooked on VAC secured hl2dm servers and l4d servers as well, if for example you hack in CS1.6 you get banned by VAC1 (gldsrc games), but you're not banned by VAC2 (source engine games)."<br>
<br>
Like i said if anyone knew half the story...they can open their mouths...<br>
<br>
I had this status on my account before i was in HCC....while i was in HCC...while i was KBH....and none of you guys thought different of me....but until that steam update came out and it shows this status....a lot of people think differently....i feel that even some of my close friends on steam dont look at me like they used to....<br>
<br>
this makes me feel like the MLB steroid era situation.....i dont know what else to say...but thats the story...hijacked account...watch out<br>
<br>
"Tazzer wrote"<br>
<br>
just to put it in the open for all to see..............<br>
<br>
Beas and Hook are 2 awesome guys and they are my friends as well and anybody who feels ill towards them can add my ass to their list cause ima stand up for them right up front, they are good experienced players whom are a pleasure to frag with!!<br>
<br>
<br>
and Beas i got the steam message from Hook's steam account too but didnt click<br>
it cause ...well i know better but sometimes we might be a little high od sumtin lmao<br>
<br>
i love you both and i can only hope you get your shit back!!!!!!!!!!<br>

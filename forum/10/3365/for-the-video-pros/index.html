<br>
I have a Motorola DCT6416 III DVR and I have it hooked up to my PC via firewire (IEEE 1394).  I'm trying to record data from my dvr to PC but am not having much luck.  My PC sees the dvr and I can use Windows Movie Maker to capture video but as soon as I hit the capture button, playback on the dvr freezes and nothing gets recorded.  I have used other programs like CapDVHS and it appears it is recording but with the same result of what appears to be frozen playback from the dvr, although when I stop the recording it shows a huge file size like it really did record but I can't play it back using WMP or even VLC.  I have searched the internet a million times over and virtually everything I find is dated from 2006 and nothing works based on that information.  Has anyone else attempted this and if so, what did you do?  Please help!!!!!!! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have capture card in one of my pc's for which I use to record stuff like tv and movies onto a hard drive so it acts like a dvr, and thats the type of program I have to use to playback the files.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks, so far what I have been doing is attaching my DVD Handycam to the output of the DVR (RCA outputs) but that quality is lacking what I'm looking for.  But even so, 42 minutes worth of video (shows without commercials) usually gets me around the 2.7GB region.  I'm looking for HD quality which firewire is, for the most part, the best to use for the highest quality.  I was looking towards several GB for a 1 hour show (an HD channel).  That's why I'm choosing the firewire route versus a capture card.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

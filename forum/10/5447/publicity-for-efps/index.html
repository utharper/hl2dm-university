	<div class="content">Some of you guys may know of Husky and HD's StarCraft II commentaries on youtube. They, along with some other gamers have launched a new youtube channel called The Game Station...<br>
They have plans to make it a professional gaming community not only of StarCraft II, but other games, including fps genre games...<br>
<br>
They have many plans for this new idea of their's, and much of it is still up in the air...<br>
<br>
I was thinking if somehow Holy and Da11aS could get one of them to post a link or even mention eFPS in one of their videos, this would be HUGE!<br>
I know you guys have many plans for eFPS, and much of it is still in the works, but this would be great publicity considering they have well over 200,000 subscribers to each of their channels.<br>

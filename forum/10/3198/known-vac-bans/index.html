	<div class="content">My second account is VAC'd.<br>
<br>
Some people claimed it was really easy to hack through an entire CAL season because VAC was stupid slow then all you had to do is tell the world you're account got pwnt,cry and then you'd get a new one.<br>
<br>
So i gave it a tried and played a couple of 1v1 with people aware that i was using this on them and (shame on me) i did worst than i usually would without hacks XD<br>
<br>
Walling requires training aswell i guess? :O<br>
<br>
Took exactly 3~ months before the account goes ban.<br>
<br>
account name is/was a_rope<br>
<br>
Account was made a long time ago because my cousin wanted to play CSS and i made a_rope with the ATI offer.<br>

All the players i listed had a long alias list of similiar names and former clans i know they were in.<br>
They have too many kills and too high a regular KPD to be one time aliasing noobs.<br>
I used a process to sift through the lists.<br>
I didnt take it lightly and possible mistakes is one of the reasoins i removed the list.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Not sure I understand what you mean.<br>
<br>
But kpd is dependant on who you fight with mostly. If a good player fights mostly noobs he will have a good ratio. I never managed to get mine above 1.25, but I know a guy, that I'm positivelly sure he doesnt cheat, and never seen his kpd below 3.0. <br>
<br>
But taking this guy Silver, I know he used an alias of «Ðe|Мōŋ» X-bow Warrior 7 months ago. I looked for all the 'eS|Silver listed and I found the one with the aliases that were know to me and the one that had them was VAC Banned. Anyway, I don't know him enough to say he cheated or not, but, even though I was 90% noob when I met him, I could tell he was a greatly skilled player that probably wouldn't need to cheat, and that is why I felt like something was very wrong here.<br>

Would that actually work??  I was banned by IP from a few places.  Now I am not, I assume it had to do with a reformat, or maybe even an upgrade in internet service as well with the same company.<br>
<br>
But yeah, it's weak through steam account, making it even worse for this game since it's free.<br>
It's probably safe to assume many people have tried out hacks, but under alias accounts to see if they were detectable or not.    <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Curiously, I just submitted a cheater ID to valve an asked them about that. Maybe if they started getting spammed with requests to end it they would do it.<br>
<br>
All of you can send that request, there's nothing more to loose than 10 minutes doing it.<br>

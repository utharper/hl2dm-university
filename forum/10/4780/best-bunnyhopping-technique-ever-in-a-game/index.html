Technically, quake games didn't have bunnyhopping because there was very very VERY little air control. This was called strafe jumping and circle jumping. As far as I'm concerned, true bunnyhopping can be best described by TFC and HLDM. Unreal Tourney had crap movement too from what I remember. <br>

Quake started the whole bunnyhop movement.<br>
Quake 3 has little air control but 1 and 2 do. CPMA added back air control.<br>
Quake 4 uses crouch sliding to turn corners.<br>
Valve ruined the HLDM bunnyhop with an update many years ago which is probably why AG exists.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">HL2DM bunny hopping is terrible what are you crack heads talking about?<br>
<br>
As said Quake started the bunny hopping it was a bug left in for a while, then altered in Q3. Bunny hopping was probably never intended in any major game it was just an artifact inherited from the quake engine which was the source of just about every FPS game ever made. They coded the movement to solve problems with games not allowing players to move correctly and then when added to air accel and bugs in friction while jumping people figured out the loop hole or exploit we call bunny hopping. Most companies at some point attempted to patch it out of the game, since most companies had noobs who could not bunny hop coding for them their patch attemts were like government laws which only partially fixed the problem and often led to more complicated solutions which still left loop holes, another tactic was to just punish the hell out of people for jumping like later CS. With HL2DM you just crouch to get around it surely no idiot coder did that on purpose but they were to lazy to patch it out once people were used to it. The early versions of HLDM and QW, 1, 2 had very nice bunny hopping. After that things went strait down the crapper and Mods would try to bring it back, some succeded.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Pardon me guys but I played quake 2 for 5 years straight and quake 3 for at least 3 years. The movement is no different between the two. You can barely maintain speed through corners unlike the games with the air control and air acceleration. The steering is completely different and as far as I'm concerned, the movement in quake 2 and quake 3 was NEVER called bunnyhopping. Maybe I missed the meeting where bunnyhopping was defined as just jumping in a straight line over and over again. The way you gain speed from quake 2/3 compared to half life games is completely different. Therefore, it's titled different.<br>

Bunnyhopping is a general conceptual term used to describe continually jumping to evade an enemy or to move faster.<br>

Overbouncing falls under the conceptual umbrella of bunnyhopping<br>
Strafe jumping falls under the conceptual umbrella of bunnyhopping<br>

Well then heres the obligatory "So, how did you fare against Garpy?".<br>

	<div class="content">Tons of players from AG/HLDM played or play HL2DM, just in the spirit of their old game they are all fake naming so you don't know who they are. I am pretty sure Rhideon was a HLDM player too though he never admitted it, his idea of a good map was always a HLDM map, he knew what was going on at the rage board and so on. Many did not fake name as well. Many ONE and HALO members played under their HLDM names and clan tags. Neo played, Trem_r, and well just go over to the AG2 thread and most of those guys who are big proponents are probably HLDM players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Of course but if he altered his interp ratio along with the interp command itself maliciously, it can make this happen on purpose. That's just the tip of the iceberg when talking about the amount of net code compensation settings available on the orange box, and even with all of them set perfectly the OB net compensation fails hard.<br>
<br>
Basically, even when tuned ideally, it feels like the very beginning of client side detection all over again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not true at all, I was in a lockdown server today, and half the server was complaining about how the shotgun is easier to get kills with now, which I agree with.<br>
<br>
I have a demo from my fov, and the person I killed's fov, of me shooting him at 100/15hp from outside backmag alllll the way to the back wall within backmag itself, and killed him in one hit.<br>
<br>
Never been able to do that before thats for damn sure, and the same guy said 99.9% of the time i was doing over 100dmg.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This.<br>
<br>
In TF2, a not-so-recent patch made it so that your first bullet hits directly on the crosshair if you haven't shot that weapon within ~1.5 seconds. Shotguns are guaranteed to have one pellet hit the middle of the crosshair under the same algorithm. Anything beyond that and the bullets go by the random cone of fire. However, TF2 may, not only have a better net code but also, have smaller cones of fire in general, leading to more consistent shots. Not only that, but there are even more cvars to remove more randomness, a very notable one being the removal of shotgun spread randomization. Rather than scatter chaotically (as in HL2DM), the shotgun splits all its pellets perfectly, creating a circle of bullets with one bullet perfectly aligned in the middle. This makes the already powerful Scout's Scattergun even more dangerous, but at least it's more consistent. Perhaps we should suggest such a feature to Valve, despite how unlikely it is to show up.<br>
<br>
But we know the insanity that the HL2DM shotgun can pull off, especially if one could actually predict its aim. Would the OPness be worth it if it meant no more randomness?<br>
<br>
I think many of us at this point would say yes...<br>
<br>
Pistol should really have perfect accuracy to give it any merit whatsoever and SMG/AR2 should be a bit more controllable (like a weapon in Counter-Strike, perhaps).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Secondly, i am experiencing the same thing, but only with secondary fire, primary fire shotgun registers more often like normal. As i have described in other threads, sec fire seems to do 0 damage most the time, even on slow moving and non moving targets, the only way to register any or decent amounts of damage with sec fire is to aim in front of the person, though it was allways like this for me its much worse now, its redonkulous, sec fire really is useless now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Holy's POV is his real demo, his name is not shown in the lower-middle and his sprint and ammo update appropriately.  Sourcetv demos make your aim look smoother than it really is anyway.  So, even if it was a srctv, you can still tell he's jerky as hell.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

and mouse sensitivity at it's comfortable minimum. Before I realised that CPL Mouse Fix didn't work for Win7 I thought my hitreg was totally fucked and that I had to switch back to XP SP3, but it was just mouse accel + FPS cap issues lol. Was another world after I turned that stuff off in a proper way.</div></blockquote>

Errr, ur not talking to a bunch of noobs here, and m_filter 1?....GF! Change that shit to 0.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Herp dee derp dee derp<br>

But you're not jerking around a whole bunch.  You can actually have smoothness and control with it.  Mine's pretty fast and I do well with it as well; I move my mouse around 2 inches to turn 180 degrees.<br>
<br>
My point is you tailor your sensitivity to what's perfect for you, and I don't think holy's tailored his well for himself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't do any damage at all, while Panic does 125 damage from 20 feet. This kind of disparity makes the game entirely unplayable. When you can't predict how much damage you think something did, you can't react appropriately. If I nail you with 6 shotgun shots point-blank, I'm gonna switch to SMG to finish you off. Little do I know that none of those shots did damage, and you still have 100/100. <br>

I'm fed up.</div></blockquote>

Been like this since day one, what changed?</div></blockquote>
I agree with this statement. When have you ever known how much damage your shotgun was actually doing?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

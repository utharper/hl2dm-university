	<div class="content">It's an ongoing problem. People don't pull their head out of their ass to read the rules or the forum. Expect forfeits, especially in the pre-season. Another reason this site exists is to promote active leagues so this happens less. The more active and dedicated players we can get in, the better it will be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
For CAL they need to post in match comm for sure and are suppose to have at least 1 irc channel listed. If you care you can try to contact them through ICQ/MSN or whatever and tell them to get in #hl2dm and post in match comm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i didnt know Tom very well, only talked to him over steam a couple of times.  From the times I did talk to him, Tom left me with the impression of a gentleman. Very polite, well spoken, and respectful.  But i always knew he was a great guy.  Our community is very tight, and we all know each other quite well, either by personal interactions or word of mouth.  I never heard a bad thing about Tom.  I can't possibly imagine the pain you are suffering with right now.  I just wanted to tell you that we all miss him very much and I wish your family the strength to get threw this horrible time.  All the best.<br>

Tom was one of my best friends, through all the problems I encounter in game and out he was their with advice or just to listen. He was one of the nicest guys you might meet on the internet. Its unfortunate the way things went and he will be missed. Personally I'm going to miss him because I'd always ask him for advice on an issue I might be having with life and he'd either have an example of what not to do or what to do. He was the most loving father I've ever talked to as well, it seemed almost every other day he'd mention his two daughters while we would chat about something completely unrelated from them. He was always excited when he would get to see them. He really seemed to be getting everything in life sorted out before this, I wish things would have gone different so we could all see what he could make of life after moving to Alaska. All of us from the online community that had played any games with pike will be missing him.<br>

I never knew Tom very well.  I only played with him a few times, and it's sad that that's all I did, too.  A great personality and attitude always eminated through his gameplay while in-game, even if he didn't talk.  And even though I never knew him well, news of his death hit me very hard.  It felt as though I had lost a brother.  I don't even consider this gaming community a community anymore.  I think it's a family, because we have all been playing with each other for at least 2 years, and Tom was (and still is) a part of our family.<br>
<br>
Pike's passing has brought our community even closer together.  I now feel closer to every person in this gaming family (and you, Pike's family) than ever before, and I now feel more of an obligation to get to know the people within better.<br>
<br>
My greatest condolences go out to all of you in this terrible part of your lives.  May you get through this smoothly and be able to think of Tom with fond memories and cherish the time you had with him.  I'll be praying for all of you.<br>

I knew P!ke since he started playing this game and I admit it felt like gaining another close friend, we chatted many times trough steam and we always had great moments he always seemed to be there for his friends and liked talking to them. Even though Im a cold hearted person , after finding out he passed away it made me shed a tear and hope i dont have to experience the same feeling again.<br>
<br>
His moments around the community will definitely be kept tucked in our memories and will bring us closer, I want p!ke's family to know that Tom will be remembered as one of the closest friends and will never be forgotten and I hope the best for his two beautiful daughters and wish they grow up with the warm feeling of their father's love.<br>

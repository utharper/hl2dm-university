	<div class="content">Yeah so, I won't go into many details, but I've heard complaints from other people so I thought it was time to post.<br>
<br>
I myself being a high grav player enjoy fooling around in low gravity servers from time to time, and being a high grav player makes low grav much much easier in my opinion. So I figure hell why not, and go into a server running a bunker map. The -[AS]- clan sniper server was the server of my choice, i played there for about a week, got to meet some people that all thought i was cool, ect ect, showed some people some tricks like the yoyo and stuff, everything was cool, or so I thought. <br>
<br>
I go in there the next day and type rank, whoazers I'm ranked #3 with a 4.50 kd ratio (not exactly sure what it really was) and the owner of the server -[AS]- Tracker, goes "oh..."<br>
 boom kicked and banned. Thats one -[AS]- server, should i talk about the other two?<br>
<br>
I won't bring up the regular dm server since all I really have to say is I was banned out of the blue from there too. But today, I was in -[AS]- Scorps Guild, they were playing a killbox map, i was just having fun kinda confused as to why I wasn't banned from there aswell, but anyway, I was playing minding my own business, had an amazing score of 7-11, so I figured, hell why not try a little bit, so I start playing for real, i get like 15 or so kills without dying making me 26 - 11 was I think the final score, so don't take 15 and think it was the exact amount of kills I had. The leader of the clan -[AS]- Scorp was 25 and 2 when I joined the server, so when I passed him he was 25 and 15 aswell, and the moment I gained a higher score than him, kicked and banned.<br>
<br>
So I recommend if you wanna play on an -[AS]- clan server, do bad.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Is this the joke forum?<br>
<br>
I play on AS servers a lot, and they are some of the coolest people I have ever met.  Most of the time gamers (if you want to call them that) on hl2dm are just in it to win and get their geek rocks off about it, they don't even care about the fact they are playing with real ppl.  I guarantee it's not true what you are saying about AS, if you are kicked out then its for a good reason, in fact the guy who posted this (panic) used to be an AS member if I remember right and was kicked out of the clan for use of scripting and bashing the group.  It's no wonder you were doing so "good" while you were playing there. AS is one of THE biggest groups on HL2DM and have some of the most talented people who can not only play, but make their OWN maps, write plugins, software and design everything about themselves.  Thats a lot more than most "clans" can say.  Panic, maybe you just should be an adult about it and contact a member or better yet, move this post onto their forums and try and resolve the issue instead of bashing people here only, it really says a lot.  There is two sides to every story.<br>
<br>
Another thing I don't understand, if all you guys get on a server for is to just start crap, or be in the intent thereof, then why even connect to them?<br>
<br>
AS has some really good players, and they also have some players that just want to get on and have fun.  Most of you "elite" hardcore players will pick on ppl who aren't very good just get on to own up and that's stupid, where is the fun or skill in that?  You get no challenge for yourself, and ruin the fun for others. I'm sure if you were owning scorp (yeah right) like you said you were then lets see the proof lmao.  Anybody can type anything just to make themselves look good.<br>
<br>
You also say you were banned? If that is actually true then how are you also pointing the finger at who did it?  You don't know who exactly kicked you lol. There are several admins for the servers and I can tell you at least four of them if you want to.  So maybe instead of guessing who supposedly did it, maybe you should find out and RESOLVE it....if you say you don't care then why did you post here?  I don't even really know why I'm posting here, I think it's just because of the spineless ppl that run around hl2dm get on my nerves.  AS will be around for a long time, and hopefully they expand past puny, buggy hl2dm and the few people that actually still play it.<br>
<br>
But from the sounds of it hopefully you and whoever else just hates on AS ppl wont be back, just one less person to create BS on an otherwise fun time.<br>

Done? plz sit down.<br>
<br>
For one, I got banned on the PURE 100% FRAG SERVER, which means both chats are turned off, the only thing you can type in is rank (lol), so I don't know how I was "starting shit". For two, I got kicked out of -[AS]- because I called Master of Disaster a camping faggot. Scripting? Lol? Please don't try and back up a joke ass clan like AS, who hide behind walls to kill people, and rip off everyone elses maps. You sir, need to get get your facts straight, or for that matter, get some facts at all.<br>

I also took the time to point out the most laughable bullshit in your post possible, they are not the biggest group in dm, or anywhere near the biggest ones, they rip every single one of their maps aside from the shitty ones off maps already made, they don't write plugins, Scorp isn't even good at all, he was the only admin there I know who the admins are, and they ripped off a frag video thats on their website. ( <a href="http://www.asclan247.com" class="postlink">http://www.asclan247.com</a>) A high gravity video for a low grav clan? Are you like dumb or something? Should I type slower?<br>

I was there today when P!ke got kicked and banned for nothing, now let me see, in this server you cant type or say anything in there. I wonder what he did????? I saw him killing a lot. he couldnt type or even talk on mic, cause the server don't allow it. so I don't think he did anything wrong. now mister bytejoust you just created your account today to post this, cant post your real name??? I am sure your a AS member trying to keep a low profile. also a friend of mine told me you guys are taking a video posting it on your youtube and taking credit for it calling it More Than Just A Clan (which it can be seen here <a href="http://www.asclan247.com/" class="postlink">http://www.asclan247.com/</a> ) I am pretty sure i am right when i see it also on your youtube page and it also says "-[AS]- MORE THAN JUST A CLAN..." Wonderful :d (taking credit for other players also I do re call a member of your clan saying CAL is GAY and SO are the CAL maps, And The Players <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> yet you all have a CAL Maps video <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral">. Interesting.  But if you say that people are just going to your server and starting bs. I am sure that is a lie cause i to get kicked and banned for nothing <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">. how can i do something wrong when I cant type or talk in game. you say Pure Frag? I see nothing but camping in your hidding spots.  HIDE away little Campers. I even heard someone 3v1 your clan and you all kicked and banned him for dominating  interesting  to be honest just admit defeat and you wont look worse then you already do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you want a SIMPLE solution, if you don't like a server then don't go there.  Every clan has assholes and every clan has problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
OH and to touch base on the asshat that says AS just jacks maps, well yes that would be true if it was a 1:1 copy and they slapped their name on it.  I think their REMAKES are 10x better than the originals.  All the bugs worked out, new features, more details, they look awesome and on and on.  Even more, think about how many AS maps you see on servers ALL OVER THE HL2 COMMUNITY!! That says something, I bet most of you use their maps too on your own servers if you run them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Think about all this drama your causing because of what you supposedly got kicked or banned? Get over it, it happens on any server and judging from all the comments from the haters here, its pretty understandable why your not allowed on AS servers....<br>

Keep up your hating guys, in AS there is so much good over bad, and believe me those who know the members know where I'm coming from.<br>

I PLAY ON AS SERVERS ALL THE TIME SO YEAH I AM THEIR FRIEND, you state the obvious kid, someone has to put light in this trashy post!  A LOT of ppl know about AS, come on seriously can't believe you would say that, how lame. There obviously bigger than you because they aren't in here laughing there asses off at this lame post.  keep 'em coming.<br>
<br>
let's see what maps you've made?  your all hardcore because you can click a fucking mouse and get a headshot...WOOOOHOOO..... so can I....how about you make 100's of maps for a game, design a nice website and forum, spend countless hours running servers and dealing with losers like you, ... thats what those guys do, they are dedicated to something they enjoy, and its ppl like you that take all the fun out of it.<br>
<br>
keep the hatin and lies comin! your probably just pissed off because you didnt get what you wanted in the clan and they told you to take a hike...now your back for your "revenge"...if you call it that.<br>
<br>
This is just entertainment, I was going to rent a movie tonight, but this is much more fun atm.<br>

You said it yourself their panic, like i said in a previous post, I'm sure they have good reasons in the world as to why your not with them anymore.  What an asshole, now I really don't blame them for not wanting you on their servers.<br>

I will give you the thumbs up for some good plotting, it probably took a while to plan all of this out.  I really think I am going to print this out when it quiets down and read it again when I'm pissed off to get me in a better mood.<br>
<br>
Who cares who thinks they are better than this person or that clan. WHO GIVES A F*CK really. ITS A GAME, ITS A GAME!!!!!!! If that's the only way you all can prove yourselves then by all means that's you.  Some people just get on to have fun and don't care about proving themselves.<br>
<br>
I play both low and regular grav, for low grav AS all the way...normal grav, TSGK all the way.  Thats it, I leave the rest of the servers alone.  It's all about personal preference guys and gals, right?  GDawgg was around FOREVER and used to be the best low grav servers, they still have cool maps and servers, but they went primarily COD (another sign HL2DM was losing it's player database).  All thats left for HL2DM is new ppl and diehards, eventually you all will move on too.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't play the hater game towards this clan that clan because frankly I think every clan has good shit too offer, but I will speak the truth to BS when i hear it.  I'm sorry I had to be the one to stand out and call it.<br>

So if you don't like it then stay away lol.  I've played you before Ulver, your not that great, your good, but not great.  You get pissed off and whine too when you get owned.  It's all part of the losing process, we all do that.

I PLAY ON AS SERVERS ALL THE TIME SO YEAH I AM THEIR FRIEND, you state the obvious kid, someone has to put light in this trashy post!  A LOT of ppl know about AS, come on seriously can't believe you would say that, how lame. There obviously bigger than you because they aren't in here laughing there asses off at this lame post.  keep 'em coming.<br>
<br>
let's see what maps you've made?  your all hardcore because you can click a fucking mouse and get a headshot...WOOOOHOOO..... so can I....how about you make 100's of maps for a game, design a nice website and forum, spend countless hours running servers and dealing with losers like you, ... thats what those guys do, they are dedicated to something they enjoy, and its ppl like you that take all the fun out of it.<br>

keep the hatin and lies comin! your probably just pissed off because you didnt get what you wanted in the clan and they told you to take a hike...now your back for your "revenge"...if you call it that.<br>

Actually, there arent many serious people here. You made it seriously amusing when you showed up and posted in this thread. That is the only reason anyone even payed any attention to it. Other then panic, who here really gives a rats ass about some clan named AS?

It is just like sacrifist said, nobody would have talked much @ this thread, but you tried to defend something that just cannot be defended.<br>
If a guys talks about him being banned from some servers, ok, I could bite you "there are 2 parts for every story" thing. If I hear you can't talk or chat, then I start wondering. When several other people state they had the same thing done to them, then there is no second part.<br>
AS "might" have some good people here and there, but there is definitely some retarded ones that just can't stand losing and are cleaning their servers from people more skilled than them.<br>
Please don't come saying AS has skilled members, I HIGHLY doubt they would since nobody knows a thing about them, and even worse (and something that makes me a bit mad), they ripped off one of the best new videos, which is ridiculously lame. If they are so good, can't they produce something of their own?<br>
And now instead of removing it and asking for an apology (at least to the maker...) all they do is disable the comments and leave it there.<br>
As you say, "get real". I don't like being rude, but that clan is a joke. If you have "friends" in there, do all of us (including you) a favor, and talk some sense into them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Now all you babies are gonna whine about is the video, boo fucking hoo, that video was probably picked because it was nice, they change videos on their homepage all the time.  So now that all the haters are running out of ammo to feed the whining, I remind you, that video was not altered or discredited in any way and credit was given to the author. <br>
<br>
Here is the same movie, Part 1 of 2, by A-Master:<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKNe7Ru97XQ" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKNe7Ru97XQ</a><br>
<br>
<br>
It's a cool video, don't get me wrong, but its not anything that great as to fuss about, especially since AS isn't taking any credit for the video.  So what, they used a video that is freely downloadable from a public site, if it were that big of deal then why did they post their precious video for download.  It's not that hard to record video in game, put some effect into it, add a game play video mixed with some music.  Speaking of ripping peoples shit, I wonder why A-Master didn't give credit for the music that was in the video, oh wait that's theirs too right? LOL<br>
<br>
I hope that AS changes the video on their site just to make you babies stop crying, oh wait they did, and its much more entertaining... most five year old's whine less.<br>

Your right. this post is way off the original topic and you all offered some great exposure, I'm sure AS is honestly enjoying this. It turned out to be quite the opposite of what Dr. Butthurt intended (aka panic, XxXxX...pick a name, or 6 different clans in a short amount of time because no one wants you)<br>
<br>
On another note, I'm happy to announce (as well as all of you will be too), that this is going to be my only run-in with this poorly designed lame ass site, and if the wannabe moderators here took any real responsibility here they would have kicked me and locked this topic out or deleted it ages ago.  This site is obviously ran by teens and incompetent adults, but I don't need to say that, just read the majority of the posts and the content of the site!<br>
<br>
Since were off on 20 different topics here on this post, I thought I would post a link to another one, it really shows what kind of idiots read and post here:<br>
<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3513&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... &amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Consider changing the url to <a href="http://www.hl2dm-preschool.com" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-preschool.com</a>, and I might take this site more serious, and that's pushing it.  I wonder how many idiots clicked that link lmao.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for allowing me to enjoy all the fruit and cereal from those of you that posted replies, it was a fun experiment.<br>

The only thing you do is to bitch about people bitchin', about how freaking awesome this AS bs clan is. They say A1 is a AS player lmfao. They kick players who are better than them lmfao. Shit they must be great please stay around, don't leave. I want to laugh at your lack of self distance.  This was no experiment, you just pwned yourself. but for God's sake stay around and let more self pwnage occur.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's a cool video, don't get me wrong, but its not anything that great as to fuss about, especially since AS isn't taking any credit for the video.  So what, they used a video that is freely downloadable from a public site, if it were that big of deal then why did they post their precious video for download.  It's not that hard to record video in game, put some effect into it, add a game play video mixed with some music.  Speaking of ripping peoples shit, I wonder why A-Master didn't give credit for the music that was in the video, oh wait that's theirs too right? LOL<br>
<br>
I hope that AS changes the video on their site just to make you babies stop crying, oh wait they did, and its much more entertaining... most five year old's whine less.<br>
<br>
...Ooh ooh who gets to flame first?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow"></div></blockquote>

You discredited yourself right there by changing the youtube page to give credit AFTER you were called on it. Oh and look, the video no longer has the AS clan on it, so it is not the same video. Re-write history much? Uploaded for archive purposes...yeah right.<br>
<br>
If someone has A-Master on friends, please drop him a line and send him this way, I think he should know someone is ripping off his video and claiming it as their own. I suppose at least the U has achieved something by forcing them to give him credit.<br>
<br>
Not anything that great to fuss about? A-Master's vid is one of the best ones made for HL2DM to date, you just are not able to see it since you will never play at his level.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol I'm so offended. If I was to hazard a guess, I would say I am probably about 15 years older than you.

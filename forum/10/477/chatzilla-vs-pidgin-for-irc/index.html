	<div class="content">Personally, gaim was ridiculous to understand. I downloaded firefox today and added the chatzilla add-on. I haven't tried pidgin, but I'm guessing that will be relatively the same thing. If you want me to write a guide on chatzilla, it shouldn't take me less than 5 minutes. In conclusion,<br>

	<div class="content">I think conflict did write one. But they are 2 entirely different animals. It seems most people in HL2DM don't really understand the point of pidgin. If you plan to use IRC only then any client will do, chatzilla, mIRC, pidgin, trillian, miranda, whatever. <br>
<br>
If you want to login to IRC all the time which any gamer should be doing then you probably want mIRC or pidgin or some other dedicated chat client. Why let fire fox and its memory leaks bog down your machine while gaming?<br>
<br>
On the other hand if you are looking to simplify you instant messaging programs which most experienced computer users do want to do. Pidgin or trillian is the way to go. These clients allow you to log in to many different chat systems all at one time under one program. This way you are not wasting your computers resources on many different programs or you do not have to say oh I don't want to have an MSN account cause I only have 10 friends on it. With plugins you can even add support for xfire to pidgin meaning you cna talk to anyone on AIM/MSN/ICQ/IRC/xfire/google talk/yahoo and many more from a single program eliminating the need to run all those programs stop you from talking to certain people. <br>
<br>
I say this cause I hear of alot of guys who read the pidgin tutorial and forget add accounts for their AIM/ICQ or MSN to pidgin and turn those programs off. Also gamesurge is kind of a lame IRC network but it is the most used one by north american gamers normally you would not need the extra plugin for IRC, in fact if you do not wish to auth your account you dont need it you can connect to IRC fine with pidgin without adding any plugins. <br>
<br>
It would also be nice for someone to write a trillian tutorial as trillian was used by about half of my clan without problems. However trillian is not good at allowing people to add AIM buddies to ICQ or ICQ buddies to aim. Another not while I am rambling if you have an AIM account get rid of it and make an ICQ account. ICQ can communicate with AIM, they are the same protocol owned by the same company the only difference is that with ICQ you can send someone a message when they are offline easily and aim does not do it well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What is the point? What is the point of IRC? can't you just use steam to talk to your friends?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Steam has a couple of drawbacks, 1 its hooked to valve so basically you move to a new game ever and it all falls apart you have no friends. Where as if you  just idled and IRC channel you can pop back in any time to contact all those people.  Or instantly get to a new channel relevant to a game you play. Plus steam has always been buggy and it will remain to be seen if they can get it worked out. People who have experience like me are not willing to give steam a chance after that 2 year span where friends barely ever worked. There are a ton of other problems with steam as well such as I really only want some people to see where I am in game and to be able to message me in game. But I don't have those options by joining the HL2DMU group now all those people can message me and what not. Group chats in steam just dont seem to work well and no one is using them. <br>
<br>
Beyond that if you use something like pidgin you can talk to AIM contacts your friends or family or whatever without any problems. You can even chat with xfire contacts.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

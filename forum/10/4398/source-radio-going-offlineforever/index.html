"SourceRadio Is Going Offline - August 31st, 2009<br>
    We regret to inform you that all operations of our website located at <a href="http://www.sourceradio.com" class="postlink">http://www.sourceradio.com</a> will seize this evening following irreconcileable difference between the management of company. On a date that will be remembered close to four years after the initial launch of the website in December of 2005 the website will go offline until further notice. All traffic will be redirected to our new website that will be located at <a href="http://www.themovievault.net" class="postlink">http://www.themovievault.net</a><br>
<br>
    The original founder Erik Kehl with the assistance of lead developer Guilherme Pinto will be relocating the website, its content and userbase to a new location as quickly as possible. A new website will be released introducing a new look, feel and interface to the users. We fully intend on returning with a new aresenal of ideals to push The Movie Vault forward as we enter into the 2010. We ask that everyone please remain patient and understanding during this time of transistion.<br>
<br>
    If you are currently a paid key member ($5.99/month) we ask that you please cancel all subscriptions to the website, and if necessary request a refund and/or chargeback if your last payment was recieved within the last two weeks. We will be providing updates on the progress of the new development at the new website which will be located at <a href="http://www.themovievault.net" class="postlink">http://www.themovievault.net</a><br>
<br>
    Once again we apologize for any inconvienence, and hope that you find comfort in knowing that the people who made this possible have not given up, and will continue to push forward without the support of previous partner Matt Marcou, former CFO.<br>
<br>
In the meantime all and any donations towards the relaunch of the new website will be appreciated, more information will be available on <a href="http://www.themovievault.net" class="postlink">http://www.themovievault.net</a> shortly.<br>
<br>
Thank you, and have a great day.<br>
Erik Kehl - CEO/Founder SourceRadio"<br>

	<div class="content">Its no biggy sourceradio was made of two parts one was for shout-casting for league matches and the other was movievault with hundreds of frag movies on multiple platforms. As said in the site its the sourceradio side that will be scrapped mainly due to the down turn in competitive leagues I guess. Good thing is the movie vault will be reborn as a separate entity where all the content will be transferred there I hope. <br>
<br>
I don't know when they decided on this but lets hope the bring up the new The Movie Vault soon I need my fix of quality frag movies.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

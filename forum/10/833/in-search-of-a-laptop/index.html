	<div class="content">Hey all,<br>
<br>
Iam in search of a high performance laptop, not for gaming, but enough to run hl2dm decently and something that will last for another 3 years till I get me degree.<br>
<br>
Budget : $2000+/-<br>
Size : Needs to be fairly portable. <br>
Main needs : Alot of multitasking.<br>
<br>
If any of you have purchased anything good or know of anything good within my budget I will highly appreciate your feedback. <br>
<br>
Thanks,</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

check that out<br>

I would not spend big bucks on a craptop, it would be much smarter to pay 1000$ now and 1000 in 2 years. Laptops break down easy good luck getting any laptop to last 3 years. Just the basic abuse they get from even a careful person generally damages parts. And then you are stuck deciding if you want to fix that one or buy new, and how long till the next part goes bad. If you want to spend 2000 buy a basic laptop for 800 or so and spend the other 1200 to buy a really nice desktop that will play games like a dream. <br>

	<div class="content">I have an XPS M1730<br>
It's a intel core duo 2.16 ghz <br>
1 gig of ram(i need to upgrade)<br>
nVidea 7950gt<br>
60 gig hd(another item i need to upgrade)<br>
<br>
pro's:<br>
18months no int. financing paid for already  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> <br>
runs hl2dm very very nice. <br>
the led lights are cool...<br>
it came with winXP media ed.<br>
it can do a lot of shit at once. i can run hl2dm in a window WinAmp/itunes and stil answer work emails from CITRIX login running Crystal reports/Outlook .<br>
when i don't need it, it can be stored in it's carrying case out of the way.<br>
speakers/sub make for decent sound...for a laptop.<br>
<br>
con's:<br>
I have a little buyers remorse, as like Fearsome* noted it will probably breakdown one day soon. <br>
it's a bowlingball, fuckiing heavy as shit. not portable if you're taking it all over the place. finding a bag to carry a 17" lapper is not as easy as i thought it was going to be<br>
i got another laptop cooler b/c the thing was too fricken hot.<br>
it was expensive. we could have taken a real nice vacation for the price i paid for it. <br>
<br>
<br>
if i had it all over to do...i would have gone for the <br>
m1330 and gotten a better soundcard.<br>

<br>
that is smaller and much more portable.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself what is the main reason you need a laptop over a desktop&gt;?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

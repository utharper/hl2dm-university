	<div class="content">I got a tripple blown glass bong, 12 inches high, used.. in great condition comes with 2 bowls, an unknown number of glass screens, and for the hell of it i'll throw in a liberty bowl, and hose for a hooka/shisha pipe, hand held scale (not a digi) and possibly a glass spoon (unsure about how many layers it is, i'll have to double check) if your interested in that as well (its not pretty or anything by all means, i actually bought it because i didn't like it, and i was sick of all the ones i liked breaking all the time - i've had this one for 4+ years). None of these are name brand... email me if your interested and i'll take some pictures, i don't need it anymore, and getting rid of it would do me some good (unfortunately EVERY pot head i know is unemployed or makes like $6 an hour and can't afford anything other than pot).<br>
<br>
i am unable to sell this on ebay due to their tobacco policy, however these things are legal in my state as long as they are intended for tobacco use only, please check the legality of this shit in your state before offering.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Makes sure you clean those things multiple times with either 420 cleaner, or my personal fav, rubbing alcohol (91%) and course grain salt.  Weed resin is still considered a form of contraband. (it can get you in trounle)  I'm pretty sure sniffer dogs would pick up the scent as weed as well.  I just wouldn't want you to get screwed shipping that stuff now that your goin clean.<br>
<br>
I would buy the bong, but 12" just ins't enough bong for me.  I really wanna get rid of my current one, I've repaired it over 6-7 times.  The bulb at the bottom even broke once but I appoxied it back together and coated the outside with truck bed liner.  At least that part won't break again lol.  Good luck stayin clean man.

yeah i got the shit to clean it, and i might even stick that bitch in the dish washer lol.<br>
<br>
its ony 12 inches tall, but the base is a good 8 inches in diameter for about 2-3 inches up, and the "barrel" if you will, is about 1 inch in diameter, 1.5 in some places...<br>
<br>
this "water pipe" is probably best for veterans, even towards the end of my days this thing would make me cough so hard i'd almost puke.. damn i wanna get high</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You have got to be kidding.<br>
<br>
I have in my household two machines running nvidia and two running ATI, not only do the nvidia machines out perform the ati machines but seriously look how often nvidia releases new drivers continually trying to improve on the good performance they already have as well as including updated profiles for new games and demo's ect, you don't get that with ati.<br>

190.38 are working awesome for me!!!<br>
<br>
Like most of you I had issues with 182 and up, although 186.18 seemed ok.  Although if I alt + tab from Left 4 Dead more than once it would crash the display driver with a new 280 card I picked up.  No issues with 190.38!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I did however find that their new system tools package for overclocking/monitoring has been updated to 6.05 and will now control my video card fan, plus it added more support for mobos and some other crap.  I never understood why their newest overclocking panel wouldn't up my fan speeds on the cards...yet it would do all the crap for the mobo/cpu and show all the correct info.  Now it does.  go figure.<br>
<br>
So, goodbye windows xp Nvidia ntune and hello Nvidia System Tools....using an xp tool package on vista...wtf!!!  All good now.<br>

Anyone try out that 3d stereoscopic sound?  I noticed they took hl2dm out of their games area...for setting custom video settings and wut not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

While it is true that you get a good picture with ati, the same goes for nvidia and I cant really see the difference in picture quality between the two I have. The difference I do see is in FPS and thats comparing even models that were released at near the same time, of course there are other factors involved and no the two machines I have are not exactly identical, but close enough. The thing that gets at me about ATI is the span between driver releases, each time a new game comes out tweaks to the profile are needed to get optimum performance out of that game. Now Nvidia does release so often most (but not all) profiles are updated in the new drivers for most new games. Considering ATI does not do that it leads me to believe (and feel) that they are not a true gamers card. Bottom line is ATI performs well and there is nothing wrong with those cards per se, but ATI just does not give as good support.<br>
In regards to nvidias drivers having issues, well I have never had a problem with any of them and I even run betas quite often. I think alot of that comes down to cleaning out your old drivers properly, defragging and optimizing your registry as part of the installation of the new driver something I do every time without fail.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Obviously they dont suck compared to nvidia's drivers if you read everyones posts here, I have never had a problem like these or a performance problem, or a problem when upgrading drivers with ATI's drivers, take back what you said <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Whilst i agree that is a stunning card and as far as i'm aware it destroys the 295 in the £/$ per fps stake, i do so desperately want 2 295's in quad sli, but i have 2 260's in SLI and i get over 200 fps in TF2 and in l4d it rarely drops below 70-150 with a horde (all at 1920x1200 resolution and every setting maxed out) so i think what's the point? Both companies have produced amazing cards but sadly with the gaming market right now they're not going be properly tested.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well I have never personally had a crash due to a nvidia driver, but I know some people do  and again its usually caused by their particular set up, hardware or installation. Over the years with ATI I have experienced some errors here and there and I can't say for sure if it was the driver or the possibility of one of the things I mentioned above, however I have seen things such as ati2dvag.dll error and crashes to desktop with a dialog box reporting the ATI driver is stuck in a endless loop or not responding so it's not as if ATI never has errors or causes crashes.<br>
<br>
I don't really think the issue here is who's driver can cause more crashes and if it is it shouldn't be because there are to many variables that can affect that, I personally think it should be more about performance and support.<br>
<br>
 I base my opinion solely on my personal experiences and that of respected people in the industry. If you are really interested on seeing some of the things reviewers, testers and builders have to say about the current situation at ATI you can look here:<br>

Lastly from someone I have put a lot of faith into over the years for being completely unbiased and providing true valuable information into PC hardware, tweaking and set up here are Koroush Ghazi's words (from tweakguides.com) on his decision to go with Nvidia over ATI in his own personal recent build :<br>
<br>
For those wondering why I didn't choose an ATI card, well although the 4870 was cheaper, it was also a fair bit slower in the major gaming engines, and thus failed the longevity test. But that's not the main reason I didn't go ATI. I'll be blunt: I won't consider an ATI card right now quite simply because I have no faith at all in the ATI driver team. It has nothing to do with fanboyism, I honestly don't care if my graphics card has an ATI or Nvidia logo on it. The simple fact is that it appears that ATI is struggling right now because their parent company AMD has had poor fortunes against the dominant Intel CPU maker for over two years. First with Core 2, and now with Core i7, Intel has outpaced AMD completely, and greatly affected AMD's profitability. AMD's decline in turn appears to have affected their ongoing investment in ATI, which has historically had a much lower market share than Nvidia anyway. Looking at the latest Steam Hardware Survey for example, we can see that this is still the case, with Nvidia cards at roughly 64.5% of the market, while ATI has only 27.1%. This market power has given Nvidia the dollars and the clout to ensure that many games are developed specifically with Nvidia cards in mind, reducing the number of glitches Nvidia users experience out of the box, and also potentially increasing performance on Nvidia cards. Importantly, it also allows Nvidia to plow more money into driver development, resulting in more frequent, more functional, and less problematic drivers. This is particularly important for those running multi-GPU setups, because for optimal performance these configurations require proper driver support; without it they effectively perform similar to a single GPU setup at best, or experience slowdowns, stuttering and other issues at worst.<br>
<br>
Now I know that this is a point of contention, because people will claim that Nvidia has its fair share of driver problems. This is absolutely true, there are driver problems for some Nvidia users. However based on plenty of research and experience, I'm familiar with how to determine whether a problem is user-based, driver-based or game-based. I definitely see a larger proportion of genuine problems with ATI drivers compared with Nvidia, especially for users of their flagship card the HD4870 X2. You don't need to take my word for it though, as professional reviewers have also noted the same thing.<br>

And with that I rest my case  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">out of curiosity, L2k.  When you install new drivers, what exactly are the steps you take, mainly - what do you use to clean your registry?<br>
<br>
I use the programs/features to uninstall nvidia drivers- I check uninstall display driver only.  <br>
<br>
I reboot into safe mode.  I then manually delete the cabs folder, which houses the directories for nvidia drivers, which contains previous versions as well if I don't manually delete them, even after an uninstall of the driver.  I also delete all the ageia phsyx folders as well.<br>
<br>
I boot into normal mode, run CCleaner, but it never finds any left over nvidia crap besides some back control panel stuff.<br>
<br>
I dont have issues with drivers, not like some seem to.  Mainly just curious on how you work your magic.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I pretty much do exactly that with the addition of using one more program besides cc. I also run ERUNT ntregopt (Free, google if you want it) which basically removes any entries from any uninstalled programs / drivers, then reboot, then install new driver, reboot, defrag, reboot and game</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

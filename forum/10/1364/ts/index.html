	<div class="content">As of March 24th, 2008, theSyndicate has closed its doors.<br>
<br>
The founders of the clan (EternalNewbie, Sopper, Tysplo and =WWIII=) decided that it would be best if the clan closed its doors. Due to inactivity and other issues the clan was no longer a fruitful investment of time or money. We did not wish to make this decision...but it seemed the only option we had. Efforts to increase activity and maintain populated servers were unsuccessful in the past 6 months.<br>
<br>
If you donated money to tS the remaining funds will be distributed fairly after the final server payments are made. Those who donated more monthly will receive a fair portion of the returns. Please contact me if you are currently donating and wish to receive a portion of what (if any) is left over.<br>
<br>
The closing of tS was not an easy decision or one made by one individual. The founders have been discussing this option for a while and were ALL in agreement for the closing of the clan. We apologize if the closing of tS has angered anyone. We did not wish to resort to these measures and wished to resolve the inactivity and server populations in greater depth. However, the 'i don't care' or 'no one can expect me to be active...I'd do what I want when I want' is not conducive to maintaining an active and competitive clan.<br>
<br>
We also had conflict as 4 individuals were responsible for the donations which fueled the clan. Others did not seem to care about donating and only wished to use the servers at their leisure and not contribute with funds or by investing time. This led to some frustrations as those who contributed felt the process was unfair that 'few contributed to the gaming enjoyment of many'.<br>
<br>
tS was originally founded on a 'casual gaming environment' with a laid back approach to online gaming. In folly this led to our inactivity issues as we couldn't expect people to be active while others were not. This and the conflict between those who wished to be competitive and those who enjoyed casual gaming often forced the clan to make conflicting plans and directions.<br>
<br>
Again...our apologies for having to close tS. We had a long successful run and hope everyone enjoyed the trip as much as we did. Thank you.<br>

	<div class="content">Yea I played TS occasionally for a long time and my old clan and theirs had several pickup scrims against one another.  At one time I contemplated joining them because there were some really good people there.  Thats how I met Zman, Rata and WWIII (Rata and WW are mappers btw) and I count them among my friends.  I too was sad to see the server go to hell because of the friends I had made there.  That was due largely to a lack of support from the majority of their clan members.  <br>
<br>
I was angered that Zman was accused of hacking by his own clan (supposedly his friends) that saw him go from a nub to a highly skilled player.  I was angered when I saw Fearsome's steam ID was on the ban list among others.   Zman, I dont know if you saw it but I did go to their forums and defended you and the rest of the highly skilled DM community that they wronged with their false accusations and just plain ignorance.<br>
<br>
As sad as I am to see the server go, I think it might be for the best if those kinds of attitudes are no longer in the DM world.  The ones that matter are still around.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

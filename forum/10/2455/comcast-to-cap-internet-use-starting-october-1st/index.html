anyone know how much bandwith playing HL2DM for say 3-4 hours a day uses up?<br>
<br>
I have two other fairly avid online gamers living in the same house and on the same connection, might be time to switch to Fios.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well it depends on how many maps you have to download, but if you play alot and download a lot of stuff, its conceivable that you could eat that 250 GB your self, with 3 people I would not be surprised if you go over.<br>

I think Comcast is shooting themselves in the foot with this unless other companies follow their lead.  Could put a hurt in online gaming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

that's what I was thinking, Verizon could destroy Comcast now by not imposing a cap on bandwidth.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Gaming does not utilize a large amount of bandwidth. It the large file sharers and people who are downloading and uploading torrents on a daily basis. For some time it has been reported that comcast has been monitoring the bandwidth usage of its customers, those who are exceeding a certain limit regularly will be capped. I do not expect gamers to be affected by this too much unless they are also running torrent clients or constantly uploading downloading large files. By netgraph info I do not think that source can take up more than 66 kbps on 66 tick server and 100 kbps on 100 tick servers, which is not very much.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ive been capped to 100gb for 3 years now, and ive never come close to reaching the cap. Gaming requires a fast connection, not a ton of total bandwidth, so if youve got a perfectly clean 128k up/down line (say, fractional T1), you should be seeing better pings and having smoother play than someone with 25mb/5mb cable whos sharing the line with 10,000 torrent users and youtube junkies.<br>
<br>
Which, btw, is of course why theyre imposing limits. Its generally only the heavy p2p/torrent users who get anywhere near those caps in general, and its certainly a big disincentive to go on dling sprees- when the price of the bandwidth required to steal a load of movies exceeds the cost of going to the store and buying them, the piracy issues that bother these companies so much are pretty much solved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Once you have every map, I go with cl_downloadfilter "none" that way it doesn't download models and all that bullshit too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just for reference Mario 64 Maser has either a 5 or 25 GB limit over at cornell and he rarely ever goes over it, only happens when he downloads large movies. So I think you are all really safe at 250GB This will only effect extreme file mongers who download more mp3s and movies then they can watch or listen to. Those are the people who will freak out. I suppose some 1080p file streaming services will be upset though. Wont effect me though it will probably make my service better as the couple of idiots running kazaa all day and night will get capped.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I am with Virgin media (no puns) they have not set a cap but have signed up for the 3 strikes your out deal where they send letters to your house if you are caught d/l illegal mp3's and whatnot then after 3 letters they simply cut your connection...supposedly, but currently they are not willing to cut off your connection so they may impose a cap instead of cutting you off... which would be more sensible and preferable for both parties. Because in my house alone 4 people use the same connection and cutting 3 people off for one persons actions would seem a little harsh.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yeah we had no encryption on our connection for a while and we definitely had people in the neighborhood leeching off our connection which slowed it down a lot, eventually we smartened up and encrypted our network and that alone made it alot faster.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

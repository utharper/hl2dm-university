How can you NOT see people on-line? You have a server list that you can filter and sort based on on-line players. (I know what you are saying about no FRIENDS on-line but go out there and MEET them instead of trying to rely on this website since NO ONE COMES HERE!) ALSO when players hear about this place they think its a cheaters haven and want nothing to do with it. Mostly because the players that say "GG. hl2dm-university.com" are usually "rapists" (above average players). And of course I've been doing my part when its thrown up to say "Fuck that place" because most of you are elitest pricks. Everyone i've talked to thats heard of this place and has been here thinks  the exact same thing. ELITEST pricks. Is it true? Probably not but thats your image out there.

Well, I cant see any servers on the server list because of my internet. As for going out and meeting them, I have over 100 friends on my list. This thread is more for newer players looking to add better players to their steam friends list and you really cant tell me that you would rather search servers to see where players are when you can look on your steam friends and be there in 2 seconds. And stop crapping all over this thread noobatrons. It is what is it. Dont like it, dont post in it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

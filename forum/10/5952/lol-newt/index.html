	<div class="content">Expanding citizenship to non combatants in other country's is just one odd decision.  What newt wanted is bring in judges to explain their positions in a back and forth conversation in front of congress.  Certainly still thinking of being the house speaker.  Which of corse would need 213 congressmen to agree with.  Not just one person.<br>
<br>
That is the check from the congress for judges.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ironic that he wants to hold judges accountable for "disagreeable decisions" dont u think?<br>
It's just fucking hilarious, considering his history, and his wife coming out saying that Newt says he does not think the law should apply to him. On its own means nothing but with all considered its easy to see that he is one sly little cunt.<br>
<br>
If the president tells congress that he wants someone impeached, on principal alone they should tell him to go fuck himself, separation of state and powers i think is the principal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The president can offer advise to congress.  In turn like you say congress can say go fuck yourself.  Just like the president or any citizen can offer legislation, or request an impeachment.<br>
<br>
Like i said, newt must still be thinking like a speak of the house because the president has different powers over the court.  Why the liberal media and democrats did not pick this part of the issue to attack newt shows you how short sited politicians can be in picking battles to fight.   <br>
<br>
Both sides do it certainly and i could give you tons of examples.  I always wonder if it is the media/politicians being stupid themselves or thinking the public is stupid.<br>

What the fuck does Newt's marriages or relationships have to do with holding activist judges accountable?<br>
<br>
Pernicious, being an Aussie, seems to have no idea how many crazy activist judges we have festering around the country.<br>
The 9th Circuit Court is overturned about 50 percent of the time!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I do understand, i have heard alot about it throughout the years, and making an example out of someone for political reasons is treason against your fellow countrymen in my opinion, maybe thats a little strong but everytime i hear about it all i can think is this guy deserves a bullet through the face or the wrong end of a lynch mob.<br>
<br>
My point is only regarding Newt, and his hypocrisy. <br>
He is the worst.<br>
Fuck that guy.<br>
<br>
The random wife thing is funny...And telling.<br>
<br>
As for Cenk being a lyer? I have been watching lately and im not sure wat u mean, all their stories have a source, and he offers his opinion and analysis, but i am unaware of any actual lies. Hell i disagree with him on things but the thing i like about the show is they actually seem to be honest. Unlike mainstream media like.....gag* fox news.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

vOz thinks bahlk hacks, probably wants bahlk to admit it, gets someone to make those screenies for him, then gives the screenies to bahlk thinking bahlk will give screenies to him as well, proof its vOz = 0, he doesn't play like he has hacks, no way. And who the fuck just randomly types that to let them know who it is, lmao.

I have never seen anything that would lead me to believe he hacks and this screenie thing is just bizarre.<br>
I told him he, he should have never played around joking and stuff with Bahlk and sending screens.<br>
I don't think he even realized what he did and how stupid it was.<br>
<br>
Here is the thing. If he is dense enough to send those screens in hope of X...he may be just be dense enough to cheat.<br>
Anyhow, its too late now!<br>

Another thing: There are a lot of guys who elevate their game pretty quick, usually 1 v 1ing someone like Luke or jump maps and shit. It seems when they get up into that top tier, that is when all the accusations start, from "The Club".</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He has very good prediction skills and aim. I don't really think there is much more to it. You guys can feel free to conclude what you want, I'm just giving my two cents.

What amuses me is, what if he does?  <br>
<br>
There was a shitstorm of hacks accusation around 911 when ducer sent demos and spoke about it and how he got them and FROM WHO he got them. Still, people played in 911's league and played them in scrims, then ewr, people kept playing them regardless, they weren't banned from here , IRC, or anywhere else... There is no punishment whatsoever if someone's caught cheating, not the slightest.

<br>
I disagree with all this, anyone who has the balls to stand up and give some insight into a hidden world legit players dont know about is a brave soul to me. I have all the more gained respect for the admission and interested/amazed to find out about a "nospread" option with the shotgun, gives me a whole perspective and possible suspicion with some players, and thats a private matter for me. I have played against hackers who later admitted it and beaten them, no doubt have lost more then a few against them but it is amazing you can get beaten even with hacks in this game, a true rarity.<br>

Am I a hacker honestly? No, but like I said I proved my point. Yes I do know what hack was shown in those screenshots. I researched them yes. I researched them for the sole fact of trying to figure out why some 1 week pros were owning me across the map with the shotgun when I knew for a fact they dont know what the fuck they are doing. See sir, I'm not afraid to take one for the team. If I wasn't sure of what people could do, I'd be making false accusations. Luckily I knew what was shown in those screenshots that were posted. Otherwise everyone would believe v0z's story about overlaying screenshots and taking a GUI from another screenshot. Then you guys would go on your marry way not believing that he hacked because there wasn't someone like me to tell you that YOU ARE WRONG. It's ok Impala, you can thank me later.<br>
<br>
Oh and to be honest, I don't care if you believe what I have to say. Or if you think I hack or not. There are quite a few people who have been playing me for the longest time and know HOW I play. They know my thoughts and rants on people who do use hacks and that's the only comfort I need. I'm just here to tell you that there are people who are completely full of shit and I can prove it.<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">its pretty clear voz at some point possessed hacks.  you can mitigate that reality all you want with excuses.  i'll take tiggy at his word and say the same about him.<br>
<br>
i find those screenies disturbing.  i think back to my brief adminning for leagues and the few disputes i've reviewed.  im not saying any of those matches i reviewed contained hacks, but what i AM saying is how naive' i was about hacks.  i had no real appreciation for just how fine tuned those hacks can be regarding "legitimate" skills.  just look at those screenies again...  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad">   the options allow a large degree of finesse, making players look obvious to legit.<br>
<br>
that being said, i like both voz and tiggy, but if i run across them or their alias on a server... i'll leave.  generally i dont pay much attention to who is on a server though.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
as for LsD, im reluctant to even scrim with any members.   i doubt that really bothers any of you.  but thats my choice.  unless LsD kicks voz.  idc if its only for fun or not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I assume everyone hacks that way when I lose, I dont feel bad, and when I win I feel like god- or good, one of the 2.<br>
<br>
<br>
but, who cares. TIggy claims he knows hacks, but he also knows he can say what he did to make it all good, so maybe it was a confession of sorts. maybe not. who cares.<br>
<br>
voz. who cares- dirtylittlemexican. fuckem.<br>
<br>
this game- fuckit. dont you all play MW2 now anyways with all your leet sauce ^^^^ and shit in your names.<br>
<br>
beside, the serious hacking was going on long before last week.  people can claim to spot hacks/trust people/know peoples style/ etc etc etc<br>
<br>
but personally, I feel pretty much anyone who is still around, thats been around for sometime now(the good players, not referring to Impala here)  - ie 06/07/05 should be more regarded as hackers than anyone else.  you dont keep playing this game cuz your leet. you keep playing because you hack and get away with it and your the only good players left in a dead game.  <br>
<br>
the real players with real skills left long ago, from that time era of HL2DM.   they came, they saw, they conquered.  and moved on.  <br>
and all your left with are people like Blas and others who speak/know of hacks yet claim they dont use them.<br>
<br>
but then you come to this point again - who cares. not me, hopefully not you.  time to move the fuck on.  you cant take this game serious if your still going to play it. nothing is what it seems.  did a lot of research with the netcode and some other things as well shortly before I quti playing this game.  theres a reason i quti.   the game is broken and anyone with 2 hours of time can easily figure out how to manipulate it and win themselves a nice 1v1 title and quti playing</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He doesnt hack, get over it. The "real" players with skills that "came, saw and conquered" got beaten before they left, pretty hard too, but good try. I figure its just a troll attempt since you never really made into the upper tier of the competitive community anyways and dont know whats going on. I'm just gonna have to go and say your an idiot, you and impala are about 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000x more useful when you were off going to wars feeling patriotic about it pzpzpz.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
it was just an opinion on the topic.<br>
blas's name was only mentioned due to the fact hes the only one i know of that specifically admitted to using a hack (to test), an example was all that he is.<br>
<br>
for the record, i never thought blas hacked, especially considering back when I was playing rather decent I beat him on aim arena a couple times and it's no secret thats my worst map.  I can assure you, that it wont be the case now however.<br>
<br>
and many thanks to Tiggy for those pics, you sir, are always good for a laugh.<br>

keep up the tough guy routine valiums, I can start trolling now if you would like??<br>

	<div class="content">I can't blame anyone for not caring about what I post, but me and some fine gentlemen were arguing about if the counterstrike source would or would not work on hl2dm, google'd CSS hacks, hit the first link, DL the first one up top, tried it, it worked.<br>
<br>
since it wasn't some "pay-us-to-hack" type of hack i got VAC banned, I even made a post about it here because I tought it was ridiculous that it took them SIX MONTHS until i get banned.<br>
<br>
VAC is fucking ridiculous because it's "random ban" feature that supposedly "make it tougher on hack makers" is actually a fucking farce as a game, by the way it is made, will always be hackable.The feature simply let players be able to hack for what could be an entire CAL season.<br>
<br>
I found myself surprised by how tougher it was (for me at least) to play with , say, wallhack on, because I'm used to simply do the stuff I feel like doing and now I was actually seeing things coming my way. The people I've played 1v1 were warned that I was using it, I believe some of em might have the demos, i'll gladly post them as soon as I can grab my hands on one, if you fancy.<br>
<br>
And, for the record, any source game hacks (DOD:S etc..) will work for dm, it's <em class="text-italics">that </em>fucking lame.<br>

Edit: found an old link that refers to it, not my OP tho.<br>

kid knew JFK was gonna get shot before he was even born. Anyways yeah the VAC bans are completely borked for the nonpay less skilled hacks. I got the rundown from some in the elite euro scene about a shotgun amplifier hack that was passed around and only like 1/10 of the people who used it got banned...but everyone already knows VAC is garbage. Also, this game is the bad mistress that gets drunk and calls our house at midnight telling you how much a f*ck you are while the girlfriend is sleeping, gets you pissed as hell but you know tomorrow night your going right back.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

More like, turn off part of the pathetic source lag compensation when using hitscan close range, so when you have your xhair dead over the enemy and press fire, you get an actual registered hit instead of just a ton of fake clientside blood.<br>
<br>
Different interp values for hitscan and prediction weapons is a pretty good idea as well, considering the former is lag compensated and the latter is not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">necro for EE is looking for some advise on this issue, any help would be appreciated.  i know ghost dog could prolly help out<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, I have finally saved up to 1,400$ and have been looking for a car to get. Many listings on Craigslist, but nothing good unless it is 2,000$+<br>
<br>
So, I checked out this 1970 Datsun 510 close to where I live, for 1,000$. No dents, only a hole inside the passenger floor (easily repairable with some welding and a sheet of metal), the original 4 speed transmission, 4 carburetors (don't know why there are 4) and all the parts that have been taken off the car come with the purchase...<br>
<br>
The only catch is that the block / engine isn't there. i may be able to score the rolling chassis of it for 800$, and have about 500$ to spare to get an engine for it. I'm thinking of trying to get rid of the 4 carburetors and the 4 speed transmission and getting a L24+the 4 speed transmission it comes with(the L24 is from a Datsun 240z, classic car I wish i could get ). Anyway, wondering if any of you guys know some stuff about engine swapping, converting, automotive repairing, any feedback would be great thnx!<br>

	<div class="content">I've only swapped engine from a Pontiac Grand Prix in a Pontiac Grand Am... AND STILL there was a surprisingly considerable amount of work to do to make things work - even fit.  Engine swapping requires alot of time and knowledge, make sure to ask around and take some serious measurements and observations.<br>
<br>
<br>
- also -<br>
<br>
<br>
It's all about priorities and lifestyle but I'd rather buy car that could use a serious paintjob or door changed but have really good parts when it comes to engine/transmission/cables. Alot of seriously good looking car are for sale for incredible prices<br>
but these requires to run left and right for parts, let alone finding originals, then it's the whole ''can I install this with that'' festival all over again. If I were you nec, i'd keep looking. <br>
<br>
What I usually do when I want a used car quick, I check for the part with the highest  Cheap/Avaibility ratio, these tends to be Honda models around here, this will allow you to get a temporary ride that can be repaired easily at a decent price, and when you get the chance to save some cash sell it and then get what you want.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
tl;dr <br>
Unless you really want this model, i'd say keep looking. It's complicated.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well datsun made a good car no doubt, the engine has 4 carbs because industry engineers were running rampant trying to squeeze more performance from naturally aspirated engines and before fuel injection was popular all they could do was make bigger carbs or use more. For an inline engine multiple carbs was the only way they could build it.<br>
<br>
Now if the engine has multiple carbs on a V motor it is mainly a style increase and won't do more than a good 2-4 barrel carb.<br>
<br>
The project you want to do should not be impossibly hard considering the engine bay you're working with is rugged and forgiving. So long as the engine/trans can mount safely, and level it will work.<br>
<br>
I think the 240z inline 6 will share the same mounts as the 510 4 but the 240 inline 6 is very long and the 510 engine bay is not. You will have to modify the engine bay to make this happen.<br>
<br>
Now about the price tag of $1000 that to me seems like wishful thinking for a Japanese every day driver that was mass produced by DAT were not talking about a vintage Mercedes here, I would pay $500 no more no less or he can scrap the body and get $200 it's his choice but the fact of the matter here is you're not paying for someone's sentimental value of a basic car body. Dude is asking too much and $1500 is enough to get a great running car without the need for work minus a tune up and trans filter.<br>
<br>
Get away from craigs list everyone there asks too much for cars IMO, go local like I do and cruise the outskirts for an old car that's cheap but not rigged up just ask around, look for reputable shops they constantly get good fix up cars and delinquent payments cause them to inherit cars they never wanted but now know a lot about. Negotiate a good deal for a good car with your local "old schools" and stay away from shifty hicks, anybody in EE knows how to spot a shifty hick.<br>
<br>
You want a project then the 510/240z swap sounds fun, you want a good car then go buy one that starts when you turn the key. Stay away from "public" auctions because these days they're anything but that, they let in your local scrap men and they WILL outbid you on anything worth buying and they are shifty hicks.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the top signs you're test driving a shifty hick mobile (and how to find out)<br>
<br>
You open the radiator cap and it's green as green can be, drive the car until it gets hot and now the coolant is brown (stop leak was used) steer clear, stop leak clogs your heater core fins and bye bye heat, also gums up your water pump and that's 100% trouble.<br>
<br>
transmission fluid smells like a burnt electric component (always drive it first and get it warm to check) bad trans.<br>
<br>
Oil reeks of gasoline = not much time left on internal seals.<br>
<br>
gasket sealer used to create entire gaskets...<br>
<br>
a block of wood supporting a bad engine/trans mount...<br>
<br>
vacuum lines plugged shut...<br>
<br>
hood does not open....<br>
<br>
excess of dried leaves and dust in the bay and or cowl means this cars has been sitting in a yard for a long time, usually you don't want to be the one to wake it up and discover what it wants for breakfast.<br>
<br>
Happy shopping.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well that's the thing, i wasn't sure if a L24 from the 240z would fit the 510 engine bay. knowing that the 510 had tiny 1300, 1400, 1600, &amp; 1800 engines in them. little power coming from those things lol. <br>
<br>
I really want to rebuild an engine, but money sure is tight around here, i have been looking for a 240z, would much rather have that than the 510. the 510 is an option for now.. i don't "need/want" to get it, but it would be a great project to work on. yeah, 1 G is a lot of money for a rolling chassis, but i may be able to talk it down, like i said up above(from what chem posted). <br>
<br>
-to ghost dog: do you know any other sites that may be good to check out? parts, chassis, anything? craigslist is the only thing i have been looking at for the past month now. around where i live, you dont see many cars like the 240z's, 510's.. i have seen only 3 240z's, and 2 datsuns rolling around the streets haha.thanks for the tips of the car auctioning, because i am going to a car auction on the 16. my father worked for a tow company and knows the owners very well, he talked to them a few days ago and asked if i wanted to check it out. (never been to one) but i have heard some of the things you have listed above. <br>
<br>
i have also been looking for a beater to do a little work, drift, little racing maybe.. but i would really like to find more of a classic car that i can keep for some years. don't get me wrong, the civics, rx7s(1st&amp;2nd gen), rawk, but i would love to get a car that i don't need to smog, or have high insurance, etc, etc. my old man had a 510, he loved it. it got totaled by a drunk drive though <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">.. my grandfather had all three Z's, 240, 260, and 280. 240 was his all time favorite.

<br>
I'm definitely still looking, have NOT spent my money on the "nickel &amp; dime" ..(if anyone got that). anyone that has more input on this, please share!! would very much appreciate it! thanks for the helpful tips &amp; info everyone!. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He also said 1 grand for a rolling chassis, hell no. Lol<br>
<br>
So i may have to talk this guy down even more.. If so, atleast i might have more money to get a ka24 into it, with a 5 spd. Or save a little more money for a 240z and get a L28 with a 5 spd in it.

ALL 240s you like are RUSTED OUT, and in the junk.<br>
Those rides were nice, but Datsuns from that era had lots of headlight water traps.<br>
And bad waterproofing.<br>
They are all rust.<br>
Crap.<br>
240zs, 280zs all gone.<br>
All rusted to pieces.<br>
Do your self a favor, even if you find a nice looking body, it has rot.<br>
Without a doubt.<br>
<br>
And the 240 and 260 z engines are great, if they don't leak oil everywhere, all the time.<br>
<br>
Buy a beater. Nurse it a little.<br>
Have transportation.<br>
Go places.<br>
Fuck this delusion about old Nissans.<br>
<br>
I know.<br>
My Bro had this disease and my Dad had the first 280ZX in town.<br>

	<div class="content">The Argumentalizer, I must agree with you on some small points, i want a car to get myself from point a to point b no doubt, but like Chemicalburn said, I <span style="text-decoration:underline">really</span> want to get a car to work on, something to learn. Learning what this project might hold, it very much could help me get a great job in the future, who knows. I'm still in search for a good part time job that pays decent amounts of money, with school on the side. I really would like to get into the automotive side of life; learn what these cars have given everyone and their mom fun and excitment that lies under the hood of a sweet ride.<br>
<br>
l2k, you're so right, cali defininetly has some non-rusted 240z's around. But so rare as to finding one for sale that is cheap to work on is tough as nails! East coast has all the shit boxes laying around with rust xD. <br>
<br>
I truely think that the 510 would be a great car to start out with, seeing as insurance would be low, cheap and affordable to get working, have some fun with it, and maybe even keep it longer to make an all day driving car in the future. the 240z will always have the slikest body style, but with the opportunity just sitting in that guys lot, I'm not sure if i want to pass it. I'm still really thinking about it. all the input I have got so far has been 50/50.. and being young with not much experience in buying vehicles, i don't want to do sometihng I will regret. :S</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

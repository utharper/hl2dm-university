No, he is very legit. This has nothing to do with ninjins, but it does raise the question as to why he had it binded in the first place. To my knowledge, the impulse cvar will do what cellar says, leave piles all over the map, so it would be easy to spot. I guess what imp is asking is, why did he have it binded and what is stopping any player from using a hack in this game?

Thats the problem, you won't get vac'd for using it.<br>
People that have it binded, obviously do have it binded for a reason, they use it.<br>
It does not always leave behind signs, and there are some places you could use it where if it did leave signs such as continual respawns, it might not look out of place. Every server should run keepers plugin and it should be CAL required.<br>

<br>
Comparing i51 to speedcrawl is ludicrous. Bhop, now thats comparable to speedcrawl; pushing the engine to achieve movement feats not originally thought possible, that raise the skill ceiling and enhance the game (the quite un-unanimous opinion that a single map is negatively affected notwithstanding). Now comparing i51 to weapon erase is far more accurate; both give the ability to completely destroy the map / gameplay, no skill required- hence the reason both have always been considered completely unacceptable in scrims, and outright banned in cal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Have I used it in a match? No. Have I spawned nearly twice the amount of armor in a map during a pub? Yeah. It was hilarious. quti crying.<br>

Thing is if you know the map you're playing in say a 1v1 you'll obviously notice if someone spawns something somewhere. Therefore I'm pretty sure this has never really been a big deal. Especially in CAL. It's not my fault the game is broken. :\<br>

Add my $0.02, too.  It's disgusting, not funny.  Stop trying to defend it.  It's not your fault the game is broken but it is sure as hell your fault if you abuse it.  It's not allowed in CAL because it's cheating.. what makes it any different to cheat in a pub?  What makes it any less dishonorable?<br>

1) that is actually a very valid point jelly it should be set up top notch, BUT your logic there falls short when you think about the fact that ninjins is NOT a pub player, playing on the DMU server, who may or may not think that is a cheat.  for one thing, nobody who is new to the game and playing on that server is even remotely aware of all these BS binds and scripts, and even if they were, they probaly woundnt know how to use them or get them.  He has been around a long time, way before me, he should know that that type of thing, pub or not, is frowned apon(to put it lightly).  and if one has the this bind binded to key, that prolly means he used it enough to have it readily available by just pressing a key.  if any of you honestly think that he had that set up and bnided to a key and never used it in matches, you're kidding yourself.<br>
<br>
2)that server is one that is put up by Paradox because she(and anyone else who runs a server) actually gives a shit about this game and this community enough to pay their own money for places for ppl to play.  i pay about $15 a month just for mine, never mind one that is paid for just so pubbers will have a place to go.  so you wanna "wink"? how about coughing up the money and time to run a pub server, that you hardly ever use, just so new players will have a place to play and learn.  then you can make a comment like that.  dont be an ass to ppl who make solid efforts to help a comminuty. thats not right.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
You are forgetting one thing: You were kicked because you used an exploit just BEFORE a friendly match began, on a server running the anti-impulse plugin! It was not "TESTING TIME", but a friendly match. I don't see why all the chuckles about that crazy armor spawning Tiggy is relevant!~?!?!  HAHAHA i suppose.<br>
<br>
"Now if I was all about this "cheat" I sure as hell wouldnt bind it as close to my type key for fear that I'd spawn something during a serious match."<br>
<br>
This doesn't make ANY sense. First off, why use a cheat/exploit when it has no value!?!??!<br>
And secondly, if you intended to cheat using an exploit, why the hell would you bind it across the room!?!?!<br>
The more useful and accessible the location of the bind, the less it means you intend to cheat with it!??!?!<br>
Uh huh.<br>
<br>
"Hence my post, I had it bound for testing and dicking around purposes, accidentally pressed it BEFORE A NON CAL MATCH, and got kicked. I rejoined the server, played the 1v1, won the match, and left the game."<br>
<br>
What is that on Ko Tao's list of excuses? #2?  Testing purposes. Testing for what? Testing to see if you could used and not get spotted? Testing to see how it works on no plugin servers? Why? For what purpose?<br>
<br>
"You guys have made this a 3 page thread over nothing about a player doing something that has NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY OF YOU. Be ashamed of me, I dont care, fact of the matter is, you guys tend to take things too seriously when the matters are not serious."<br>
<br>
I'll post whatever the fuck i like, about whatever the fuck i want.  And yeah, we take cheating seriously, which obviously you do not! And it happened on OUR SERVER, with our plugin, so how is it just your business?<br>

This is a rationalization. This isn't about the other 1000 exploits you know, although maybe it should be. Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you should. Oh well, that seems to be the way the world is moving so i shouldn't be surprised.<br>
<br>
If that exploit is banned in CAL using it in that situation is cheating.<br>
Nobody accused you of that.<br>
Nobody accused you of being a cheater.<br>
Nobody initially at CGC identified you by name.<br>
This issue is no different than toggle zoom.<br>
Thing is, i never saw you post "Hey folks, check out this neat exploit!" so others would know about it.<br>
And i think you protest too much.<br>
It makes you LOOK guilty of something.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

100% correct.  exactly my point. ppl who are just starting out, coming here looking for advice, read that stuff........their gonna use it.<br>
<br>
also i agree with impala, that if you are truly testing something you do it in a controled test environment in which all parties involved are aware of the test.  keeping the test a secret, in a public environment is more likely done when you are looking to see if it will be noticed or if you can get away with using it.  i mean, you could have waited until you got a hold of impala, told him you were gonna test something in his server to see what the results were.  done, end of story.  personally i think you are a nice guy, and im pissed you are the only one that has got nailed on shit like this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
What i referring to is the drama threads trolling. i don't think tiggy is scriptin.<br>
scripting and hacking is wrong. no one should use them and it's in fact very easy to detect those tards online.<br>
<br>
That being said, trolling on someone that is well known and has enough merit and skilles to back it up and who keeps explaining he was not scripting to win should at least warrant some serious consideration and not be waved off like some lame excuse and laughed at.<br>
<br>
Many ppl including mappers (tiggy?) and others who explore game cvars for interest or fun have cheats bound. what this thread is doing is in fact looking for a scapegoat and not looking into a problem. it's BS in disguise.<br>
<br>
It's sad that only when there's drama here so many pop their head out of their popcorn buckets and flame the fuk all but say nothing when actually something serious is on topic. i think that's what's lame.<br>
<br>
@ chem, valiums :  BTW trolls know who they are and those who aren't trolls know who they are, that's as to who i'm referring to etc. etc.<br>

I disagree with everything you said other then "it's just a game". Im questioning the reasoning for using it at all because this game shouldnt be taken seriously.

<br>
Many ppl including mappers (tiggy?) and others who explore game cvars for interest or fun have cheats bound. what this thread is doing is in fact looking for a scapegoat and not looking into a problem. it's BS in disguise.<br>
<br>
It's sad that only when there's drama here so many pop their head out of their popcorn buckets and flame the fuk all but say nothing when actually something serious is on topic. i think that's what's lame.

I disagree with everything you said other then "it's just a game". Im questioning the reasoning for using it at all because this game shouldnt be taken seriously. Obviously, those that find the need to use such a command take it way to seriously, otherwise they wouldnt bother binding it in the first place. Wanna know how seriously I take this game? I scroll my weapons.</div></blockquote>

lawl. i dont think anybody gives a fuck that you accidently hit the bind, i think most are concerned that you had the bind there to hit.  if i go into a public place with a gun, say a bank, where obviously the public are not supposed to have weapons, and i point the gun at the cashier, and shoot her, im pretty sure the judge wont accept the "i accidently hit the tigger" excuse or the "i didnt mean it, i was just testing the gun to see if it would work" excuse.  why?  because its fucking irrelevant.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Settle the fuck down people.  I'm sure half of you have no idea how this exploit works, because if you did, you wouldn't say it's the least bit useful as a 'cheat'.  When you spawn the armor/health/smg nades/etc. is continually respawns in that spot for the entire round.  So if you shit out the exploit somewhere it so goddamn obvious that it's ridiculous.  To jump all over tiggy's ass for goofing around with it in a pub is just retarded.  All of you at one point have found a new 'trick' went into a server and whored the shit out of it.  It's one thing to actually try to cheat with it, it's quite another to try shit out while playing around.  As far as binding it to a key goes, that's the only way you can actually see what it does, otherwise you'll be typing it 6000 times because even the exploit of this shitty game is shitty.  You have to do it just right and over and over again just to get a few items.  If I had a buck for every bind I've made and completely forgotten about, I'd have like...hmm...alot of 1 dollar bills.  I mean alot.  Somebody fucking turns on sv_cheats 1 and I'm shitting rainbow trails and making splashes all over the map and have no idea what keys I've got that shit bound to.<br>
How many times are exploits used to actually gain an advantage and no one says shit about it?  Watch the Seagull vs Luke 1v1 finals from a few seasons ago.  Anyone bitch about the sawblade jumping?  Nope.  Anyone ever lose sleep because of speedcrawling in a pub?  Nope.  Anyone killed themselves over all the air humping in killboxes?  Nope.  Well, none that we know of anyway.  <br>
My point is that the game has stupid bugs all the way through it.  Yes, using i51 is a dick move when trying to actually gain an advantage, but goofing around with it in a pub where everyone can see just for shits and giggles is another.  You've taken a respected member of the community and placed him in a group with the likes of VAC banned douchebags because of stupid rant someone started.  Good job.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral">

At the time the command was almost completely unknown and the hope was that it would remain that way until valve came out with a patch. But it was first discovered and reported over a year ago, and nothings been done since, so obviously valve wasnt interested in putting the reports to good use; perhaps thousands of bug reports sent by random disgusted pubbers will have a better result.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

we're not really 'free' to spread it around, i've been warned by some that i couldve get banned and i shouldnt post shit like this here etc etc...<br>

I just felt like i had to post it no matter what, lets say i take something in my hand and i try to protect it, it will draw your attention and you'll get curious over it and now god knows what kind of bs may happen so you know what's in my hand.<br>
<br>
If everyone knows about, it you prevent people from starting panic post sprees about known players spawning shit all over the place on  pure 2 / cheat 0. <br>

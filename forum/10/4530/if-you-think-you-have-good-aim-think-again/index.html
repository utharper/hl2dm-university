Well im sure someone else would tell this story but looks like no has yet. Lost Cause tried to convert to hl2dm from quake for FIOS and trained with cyn^ but for whatever reason just couldnt hack it, I specced a few matches he had some serious movement issues, he was slow and unable to keep a consistent bhop going. His aim in quake at the time was incredible but really couldnt cut in hl2dm either. At the time he was a top 5 US player, and would later become one of the top 5 in the world. I just think hl2dm is a vastly different game requiring different sets of intuitive abilities.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree there too, but its not like one couldnt adjust if they had the will.<br>
But in cpma aiming is different because the player models are quite huge on ur screen, hl2dm player models are small. Also the faster movement makes players easier to predict in most situations etc. But there are some fuckin beaut aimers in cpma for sure.<br>
Though, in hl2dm, every tactic, every orb/nade slows down gameplay in 1 vs 1, alot of stoping to catch/spam/camp/wateva where as cpma its generally allways click click click go go go even in the beginning of matches where players are a bit standoffish so they can get the first kill its much faster gameplay...etc<br>
<br>
For 1 vs 1, play CPMA, for ffa, play HL2DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Quake3/live and CPMA have vastly different movements<br>

<br>
I was a quake player long before playing hl2dm and after playing cpm, hl2dm still cant compare.<br>
<br>
But these are apples and oranges we're talking about here.<br>
<br>
I will say, and I am indeed boasting (i dont get to do it that often so stfu), that some of the people that used to stomp me in hl2dm could NOT touch me in hl2dm pro. It was just more my environment due to the speed of it. I've always had a quake style of playing and playing hl2dm with that style just doesnt work the same for me. I need to be constantly moving at a high speed to even aim properly. I know, its weird.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It is not so much apples to oranges as just different types of people. Different people are good for different reasons some people like Fatality are just amazing players they can go into any game learn it adapt and eventually own at it. However not everyone is like that some people are just good at a game because they have played it so long that everything is natural. It is hard to tell which people are which in their own game but as they travel to other games it becomes more apparent so long as you give them ample time to play and improve. Micahwave was a great adaptive player I have known him for almost a decade and he has moved from one game to the next and always been a top competitor in anyone he applied himself too and he showed in his ability to  win FIOS in such a short time. Had we gone another couple weeks guys like the late neo and perhaps others would have risen up. <br>
<br>
Now back to quake / cpma / any version they are all the same basically. You have to remember when playing those games that some of those guys have been quakers since they started gaming and for many of them it has been over a decade of playing the same exact game day in and out. So when you go there and play them they do not even think they just do. Also they have had many competitions and so more of the pro gamers tend to play quake due to the money involved and even other pro games are mostly modeled off of quake like PK. When you take some of those guys like lost cause and move them into a game that is very different they just are nothing near what they are in quake. And my guess is the majority of them probably fit that bill. They are not really that smart they are just well trained. You could see this in FIOS when you would see all these random pros from other games, some of them would try to do things that just are not as effective in this game like weapon timing. There was a guy from Halo I think in FIOS who had amazing xbow aim but the guy just had nothing else going for him in overwatch he would camp the xbow instead of the rocket. It was like he just didn't get this is a new game and the effective tactics are probably not exactly the same as your old game. <br>
<br>
It is true that if HL2DM had been more popular many of us would probably not be considered good players but that's neither here nor there because people who are not that good tend to be attracted to games like this with smaller less competitive communities. In fact you could probable make the arguement that besides the elite virgins like Luke and Seagull and people who started in this game everyone else like myself is a washed up noob who cannot hack it in other games. Maybe us losers can make a club want to join ninjins?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">meh...I watched the FIOS final dems and everything inbetween. Mario64, TLC, drag0, that really short guy from cyn all the other players played differently from how they play online. Micahwave was consistently boring and solid on LAN, probably because he was the only one with LAN experience. If those other players had LAN experience and confidence Micah would've been taken down but thats how it works in any game. In LAN finals of any game competition the players with the most LAN experience usually beat down the players with only online experience, whether thats tfc, q3a, cs 1.6, css and ect...Michahwave never really impressed me except with his calm professionalism and will always be only an upper tier, mid range upper tier at best. Give some of those other players LAN experiance and I gaurentee Michahwave wouldve went down.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

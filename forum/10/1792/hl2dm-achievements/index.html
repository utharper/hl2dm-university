	<div class="content">ok so it's a long way off but what Achievements would you like to see in Hl2dm<br>
<br>
dods got 52, and with the last tf2 update tf2 also got 52, so we can assume that hl2dm/css will get the same number<br>

or like, 100 kills with smg, crowbar..<br>

	<div class="content">team fortress 2 is supposed to get a bunch more achievements, a batch for each class<br>
<br>
i agree strongly with l2k, the whole concept of achievements is very gay in the first place, and lo and behold, the pub scene in tf2 was completely ruined for about 2 weeks after the medic achievements were released, just a bunch of crap medics with their bonesaw out or purposely healing bad spies to get that achievement. of course most people, like me, just farmed them achievements, and that was stupid and a waste of time and i wouldn't have bothered if there weren't new weapons to be had for the class i play<br>

overall though keep achievements on the consoles for the kiddies, they don't add anything positive to the game</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Rank/Stats are never 100% correct. But they make addict to many players because they think that the rank establishes who is better than who; which is stupid IMO.<br>

If it was similar to PD then many players could have the same rank or rating, i think rating is a better term to describe it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Things like:<br>
- Return frag nade to it's receiver and kill him.<br>
- Cook a nade and kill two people with it (omg so hard).<br>
- Speed boost an orb (omg free achievement).<br>
- Grab an orb shot by someone and send it back to him.<br>
- Catch and shoot back a prock to kill its owner.<br>
- Kill a person with an XBow that ricocheted at least twice (lockdown hall, anyone?).<br>
- Kill someone with the Lockdown plug.<br>
- Guide a rocket at least 90 degrees and hit someone (lostvillage or overwatch are good candidates).<br>
- Headshot someone at least 1000 units away with a Magnum.<br>
- XBow someone at least 1000 units away (don't need to kill, hard enough to hit as it is).<br>
- Orb someone at least 1000 units away (lol).<br>
- Shoot a prop and have it kill someone at least 3 seconds later (either high lob the explosive barrels to RPG in overwatch or really long distance kill).<br>
- Shoot a SMG nade and have it kill someone after 3 seconds of initial shooting.<br>
- Kill X amount of people indirectly by shooting a barrel with your gun/explosive.<br>
- Kill someone less than a second after they spawn (so people will be like "OMFG VALVE ENDORSES SPAWN CAMPING IT'S MEANT TO BE IN THE GAME LET'S TAKE AWAY SPAWN PROTECTION, IT'S JUST AS TERRIBLE AS TURNING CRITS OFF IN TF2, UNINTENDED BY DEVELOPERS."<br>
- Detonate X SLAMs without getting hurt.<br>

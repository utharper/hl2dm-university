	<div class="content">Was playing HL2 again (Again?!?!) when i had a thought: why did Valve change the entire game and remove the BH from Episodes???????  I mean, that is a killer part of the game, strafing to pipes and bounding past a lot of trouble.<br>
It does not bode well. The gameplay is so different in Episodes, drastically different.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I dont know exactly what it is like in Episodes but valve never did like bunny hopping. They took it out of HL1, but their solution was terrible. The only reason it was in HL2 was cause valve had already separated the 2 code bases and never went back to get it in hl2. Then I suppose they finally got around to it somewhere before EP1. Maybe if they are not working on HL3 HL2 will be the last game with bunnyhopping if the code base from say OB is used next time around. But who knows valve is the king of letting old bugs slip back in, the old copy and paste / reuse files gets them every time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Cause if they said otherwise they would have had to fix it. <br>
Also lots of pressure from many people at the time to keep  it in was there too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Funny how they fail at seeing how it's a must. bunnyhoping or advanced movements in general are what get people addicted, not only you have to aim good and be smart, but without these two you can still have an advantage. Some scouts in TFC would be so damn good with their conc grenades, you wouldn't even need to fire a single shot to go in/out with the flag under 20 seconds. <br>
<br>
People feel that they can dominate their opponents, even a bunch of ennemies, just by mastering X aspect. Look at the shooters out there, not alot of really old ones are still played. Quake's still played, hl1, UT ...<br>
<br>
Why's that? because you have to master a "hidden thing" a feature that, if no one look into it, you're above the rest, being called "hacker" etc... people love that. Anyway, i think removing bhop isnt cool, if they do update dm with the OB, i hope CAL default walk speed will be sprint speed to keep the pace of the game to what it was. Just my 2 cents</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I am thinking the current version of DM is the end of the line for advanced movement. The advanced and esoteric aspects are not inline with mega selling games and they do not fit the square plain jane but stable environment for competition.<br>
<br>
It will probably be that a Mod like Pro will be the next destination for all the Dm fanatics.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

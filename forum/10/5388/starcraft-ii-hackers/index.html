Just wanted to let all you starcrafters out there know that there ARE hackers... <br>
Check this replay from the protoss camera... you'll see he looks at my base early game, before scouting, and foresees all my armies coming, and often checks my base through the fog of war...<br>

<br>
Let me put it this way, I didn't get a local rating of 1700 in chess for no reason, I know both chess and starcraft probably 5x as well as you do. If you don't think so I'll be glad to challenge you in either game. <br>
<br>
That said they are similar in that there are numerous "opening" lines in both chess and starcraft that go in and out of favor, the indian defense is equivelent to say a 3rax terran opener into vikings, an unorthadox and highly new strong opening thats being tested in its limits. Mid-game and endgame scenarios have the same feel of chess IMO. Yes they are completely two different games but I have yet to play a game that feels so similar to chess, in this game as in chess the more you know, the better your openings, you will be guarenteed to win once you hold even minute material advantage after gaining that small advantage in the beginning if you play correctly for the rest of the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was just saying that it hard to discern what is happening as a non-player and that is not just like chess.<br>

So you admit that you know nothing about sc2.  So you admint you couldn't understand why it is like chess.   How can you argue that it is not like chess?  Why are you trying to tell people that know both sc2 and chess?   If you want a guest pass for 7 hours let me know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
There never was a debate. I had to pleasure to talk with an International Master of chess today while he was streaming in <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net" class="postlink">http://www.teamliquid.net</a> who is a starcraft player who said starcraft is one of the most similar games there is to chess.<br>
<br>
If you don't take it from a guy who could wrap circles around my brain with a 2400+ rating and can beat people like Magnus Carlsen in blitz chess, I think you truly do wallow in a world of ignorance where you make snap judgements without knowing the criterion about it.<br>
<br>
P.S. he will be streaming the U.S. Chess championships with analysis tomorrow night (not sure of time) here if anyone would like to watch with me <a href="http://www.livestream.com/LiquidBela" class="postlink">http://www.livestream.com/LiquidBela</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I can agree that the core of the game play and the mechanics are pretty much chess. The execution is something completely different. Therefore I can see Impalas point where he states it's nothing like chess, as he does not know anything about the game. <br>
<br>
As I can see it, you're just focusing on two different points and just walk around each other. <br>
<br>
The vision of the game play and the mechanics are indeed extremely similar to chess. Al tough the way you execute it, is imo something totally different. You can only execute one move in chess before it's your opponents turn, where in starcraft you the limit is your microing skill vs your opponents that limits the moves you can do before your opponent has done his. There are more hidden factors in starcraft which introduce chance to the game. As Impala stated with his comment. <br>

I mean to say, and the person I spoke with meant to say is compared to any other PC RTS game, starcraft arguably comes closest to chess in its mentality and the likeness of build orders. Last night the streamer was talking about how in both in chess and starcraft there is a current tragedy going on in both communities of just copying build orders from pros instead of learning the hard way from scratch up. He said in both games it undercuts your development and you will pay later for taking shortcuts, after he proceeded to beat an a fellow International Master with a 2567 rating all while talking about starcraft instead of really focusing on the game; I then proceeded to offer him an internet BJ<br>

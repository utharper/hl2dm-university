	<div class="content">Well since you all seem to be having a field day blasting my teammate I'll just make this thread 'till he gets here. The demos exist, I have them. I know he doesn't play css under the name confused for CEVO. I believe he's playing ESEA this season on x3o with nickn0it (lol valiums threatening to ask nick if confused was legit) under the name Legend_ but I'm sure he'll get the details for you. I'm impressed at how much time and effort you guys have gone to to find final conclusive proof that confused doesnt play css in cevo-p/esea/whatever. I pretty much just lost all remnants of belief that you guys were actually cool people. Rach whats with you man? You think he hacks? some sort of gravity gun script that launches itself when your alt tabbed? How exactly would you write that. You know what? Now that I think about it, I'm really not sure why he would want to bother coming here to "defend his honor" to people that act the way most of you have, although I'll urge him to in order to simply take you assholes down a notch.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

oooololol joke of the day. If you have the demos post them. Also look through <a href="http://www.esportsea.com/users/125033" class="postlink">http://www.esportsea.com/users/125033</a>. None of that team has the age nor the name of our dear Confused. Also he couldn't be playing with nickn0it because nickn0it retired from competitive play and is only on the roster to fill in for Solrak when we went on vacation a week ago on request by Solrak, he doesn't play in x30 anymore once again. Also, click on the name Legend_, he's a 22 year old guy with a beard, and I've known about him for years. None of those other guys on x30 are confused either, because I know each and every one of them and their history, unless COnfused is aliasing as an older player, under a different name, which is illegal in Cevo-P because they do background checks? NT, if Confused will tell us which of those players he's aliasing under I'll go post in the Cadred forums about this revelation.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Mr. X was never likable.<br>
Mr, X was never helpful and always bragging and acting like a PUNK, but wasn't Punk.<br>
Mr. X later on met Mr. Z, who was a really cool dude.<br>
Z hung around X and started to take on the characteristics of X.<br>

Just stop dude lol. His pathetic last whimper was to post a HLTV demo, which was stratigically done to still hide us from who claims to be from x30. Furthermore x30 never even made to the playoffs in season 7, you posted two different HLTV demos from two different regular season matches. Posting vague hltv demos of a team that never even made the playoffs makes it look worse. Just admit you lied and get it over with, your reputation is already dead at this point and took Z's down with it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

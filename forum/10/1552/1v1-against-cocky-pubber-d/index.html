	<div class="content">HHAHAHAHA liast night I had the most hilarious 1v1 against some cocky pubber named Broly (never heard of him, but he's on IRC right now so it reminded me to post about out match). met him in a Socal server and he challenged me to a 1v1... I won without making a kill at all <img src="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
So I arrive at his server and his mate says "map?"<br>
<br>
"lv"<br>
<br>
(yes I have something in mind to make a big joke of this cocky pubber :)<br>
<br>
We get to LV and the next question is "time or frags"<br>
<br>
(well fuck this is going to be an easy job)<br>
<br>
"time"<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CAL settings are put in place, 5.. 4.. 3.. 2.. 1.. restarts... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OMGZ0RZ RUSHZ TO TEH XBOW ROOM AND LOCK IT!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
his mate was laughing his head off in spec<br>
I just sat there while he tried to kill me through the wall<br>
<br>
"haha cmon man this is fair" .. "we're not playing CAL rules :P"<br>
<br>
13 minutes left in the round. I had to tell him that "if you end it early you forfeit loss"<br>
<br>
Well he forfeit lost. lol. pwnt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(ok go ahead, feel free to call me a fucking idiot loser noob, i thought it was funny)<br>
<br>
<br>
then afterwards I talked to him in steam, he pretended to be shunnyboy :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

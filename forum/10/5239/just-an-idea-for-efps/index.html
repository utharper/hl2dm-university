	<div class="content">hey i was thinking maybe you could incorporate some kind of system where players can bet on the matches... not real $ ofc, but like some efps site only type of currency...<br>
i know theres a starcraft site where they bet minerals on upcoming matches, seems kinda cool..<br>
maybe we could bet orbs or something, like each person starts out with 50 orbs...<br>
and have higher payouts if someone wins who was the underdog or however that whole betting system works... idk exactly, just a random thought <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">How can you bet on a team that doesn't exist?<br>
<br>
The Draft will go down on the spot. I think it would be a good idea to collect Team Captains during the week.<br>
At least commitments. The Draft should shoot to make it quick and painless as possible to play.<br>
Getting commitments during the week and team assignment will go a long way towards simplifying everything.<br>
Of course, the Captains are not permanent but it should be a priority to spread the best players around as much as possible, making the matches closer.<br>
<br>
My point , i guess is, is to try to make the Draft a big success and the rest is CAKE.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Know your role, and shut your mouth.<br>
<br>
Impala might be a little wacky, but he's an honest man that states his opinions and doesn't back down from it.  That's something I respect.  He's put in his two cents into about every matter that affected this community and stood by what he said.<br>
Now, to quote one of my favorite movies:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Now, dicks have drive and clarity of vision, but they are not clever. They smell pussy and they want a piece of the action. And you thought you smelled some good old pussy, and have brought your two little mincey faggot balls along for a good old time. But you've got your parties muddled up. There's no pussy here, just a dose that'll make you wish you were born a woman. Like a prick, you are having second thoughts. You are shrinking, and your two little balls are shrinking with you. And the fact that you've got "Replica" written down the side of your guns and the fact that I've got "Desert Eagle point five O" written down the side of mine, should precipitate your balls into shrinking, along with your presence. Now... Fuck off! </div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

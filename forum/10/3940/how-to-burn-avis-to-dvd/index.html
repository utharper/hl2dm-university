While you can burn it with windows and Nero it will make it a data type dvd. I think he is asking how to make it like a DVD which plays like a DVD when inserted into a DVD player PS2 ect</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

DVD std. compliant (vob)<br>

That the standard shit coding. You may choose Video or Data DVD. It's a matter of clicking, lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't really care if it plays specifically like a DVD. Like, I don't need a menu or anything, I just want to be able to put it into the PS2 and it play. <br>
<br>
If it's a date type DVD, will it play in the PS2?<br>
<br>
If I convert it to VOB, then would I use Nero to burn it?<br>
<br>
Will this work? <br>

	<div class="content"><a href="http://www.dvdflick.net" class="postlink">http://www.dvdflick.net</a> the standard dvd is 480p which you can read detailed info here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/480p" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/480p</a> it does a fine job of converting files into a VOB format which if you open any dvd on your comp you'll see thats what a standard dvd's format.<br>
<br>
um.. i know of older tv's like mine non-lcd whos max res is only 800x600 and it may look pretty terrible on anything that it can't support so if you can try to scale it down to fit your tv's optimum res if you dont know what it is google it</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is what I was trying to get at but according to Soiz its a matter of clicking standard shit lol. (uh no)<br>
It can be a bit more involved and one thing I have had some luck with is converting files to mpeg then you can click standard shit lol. Otherwise if you are going to go the .vob route you need to use a program to sync the files then a dvd authoring program to get good results. There is a ton of info on google about doing this type of thing. <br>
As far as just burning the avi file to a dvd as a Data file, there are some dvd players that will play it and some that wont, I know the xbox 360 will not but I dont have a ps2 so cant say for sure on that one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have 3 or 4 in my house. One is kinda cheap so it only reads original DVDs or cloned DVDs. The rest is ok.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

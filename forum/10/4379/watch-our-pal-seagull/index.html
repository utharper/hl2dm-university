And ya, the execution level / skill ceiling is lower than tfc, just as css is a lesser game than cs, just as diablo 3 and starcraft 2 will likely be a good deal more nub / casual friendly than their predecessors. The general gaming population is now composed of people who want the equivalent of interactive television, and accordingly / unfortunately, hardcore games with steep learning curves tend to make for a bankrupt dev team. All things considered, i think the tf2 community can count itself lucky the game is playable at a competitive level at all (which, i should mention, it wasnt for the first few months it was out).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah my anger is more with how I picked up HL2DM to subside my wait for TF2, which I thought would be faithful to high skill, intense and constant fast paced play and totally ripped the guts out of the TFC playstyle of it's truly advanced individual play. Fortress Forever pretty much failed because like any 3rd party mod of a popular steam game it just never gained traction along with the fact it was released with some really bad bugs that were never ironed out by the unmotivated staff at FF to get the game working properly until months later, which by then a big chunk of the TFC community had given up on the game by the time they fixed them. Anyway this is what TF2 could've been, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAsxa0VqrF0" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAsxa0VqrF0</a> just imagine that engine with even better graphics and more unique adds by the steam devs. Vid takes awhile to load its huge.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

mainly a CS, CoD, and L4D  casting site.  good stuff. <br>
<br>
believe it or not, l4d is actually pretty decent to watch.  I just like seeing who shoots the other in the back, plus they do some cool shit like jumping into peoples ventrillo at critcial moments of the game, giving you an idea how teams handle situations.<br>

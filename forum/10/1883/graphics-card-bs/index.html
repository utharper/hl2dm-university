so im currently using a 7100 <br>
<br>
so, went and got an 8800 GT and got a 550 w power supply<br>
<br>
card doesnt work<br>
<br>
returned it and got another 8800<br>
<br>
ive tried using the 6 pin connecter, 4 pin adapter, giving certain parts dedicated power blah blah blah<br>
<br>
went to geek squad (got my hopes up that they might be more competent than me  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> )<br>
<br>
told me my mother board was dead.. that nothing they could do, and i wasted $60 and they wouldnt give me a refund.<br>
<br>
some kid there was like... ya i think its the card, tried another 8800 GT OC there in store... ddint work.. blah blah blah mother board...<br>
<br>
came  home after allmost 3 days of this shit.. plug in the 7100 and it works fine<br>

Is it integrated?  Did you disable the chipset graphics and DL the latest 8800 drivers?<br>
<br>
After three GPU boards, it is not the board. It is the power supply or something else.<br>
The 8800 should need just one four pin PCI-E power connector.<br>

<br>
Geek squad is far from it man I went there to trying to find what CD(s) my PC needed for a reformat, considering it came form best buy why not go there and see if they have it still.<br>
<br>
I found the geeksquad counter and the guys tells me, Hewlitt Packard doesn't use recovery disks for thier pc's.......<br>
<br>
dot dot dot<br>
<br>
Then he says they do.....apparently he had a revelation but anyway he tells me good luck finding a recovery cd for a pc built in 2005 (this is late 2006 we are talking)<br>
<br>
So he says we can't do anything I have to call hewlitt packard support, so I ask him for the number (we all know damn well they have it listed there) he tells me "I dunno I think it's 1-800-HP"<br>
<br>
dot dot dot.<br>
<br>
Back on topic, I don't know what the 7100 is, but is the 8800 the first card you've tried in your PCI-E slot?<br>
<br>
I wonder if the pci-e slot is even working to begin with, also check your BIOS I had to tell the BIOS I was using PCI-E graphics specificly, in the advanced options.<br>
<br>
I have a feeling your PC just missing one step to get it working because it can be an ordeal with certain mobos.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT:Forgot to mention I found hp's number and called support, whole thing took 8 minutes tops and $15 later I had 2 HP recovery disks on thier way to my house and a free extended warranty they noticed I was elidgable for, fuck you best buy.<br>
<br>
Fuck you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

However if you do have onboard graphics for your motherboard it is possible that they are feeding the image though there, put the 8800 back in but plug your vga/dvi/w/e cable into your motherboard video and see if the display turns on.<br>
<br>
If that doesn't work than it's probably the compatibility with your motherboard and the 8800 and you should do the google search as suggested above.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you can't even see the garble that is thrown up by the screen before windows starts to load, then your bios could be an issue or it could be your PSU (I think this thread is sounding a bit like a broken record <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> ).  If you don't know what motherboard you have, download cpuz (<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/download/cpuz_145.zip" class="postlink">http://www.cpuid.com/download/cpuz_145.zip</a>) and look under the "Mainboard" tab for the manufacturer and model.  Then search about as others have suggested.<br>
<br>
There should be no driver problems.  If the card is not recognized by your nVidia drivers, Windows should revert to its default display driver but still work.<br>
<br>
I disagree with some of the folks saying the PSU is not an issue.  With any PSU, wattage means crap, amps are where the money is.  Some of the cheap 550W PSU's on newegg only have 25A on the 12V rail (to compare, my Corsair 520W PSU manufactured by Seasonic has 54A on the 12V rail).  If you want to check the amps of your PSU open up your case and look at the sticker that is (hopefully) facing you.  Take note of the 12V amps (if your PSU has multiple 12V rails, add the values).  If it's less than 28A it may be inadequate to run your card.  If you don't see a sticker, it's on the other side of the PSU  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> .<br>
<br>
For general troubleshooting:<br>
<br>
1) Unplug all optical and hard drives, and any other nonessential components you have hooked up to your PSU (keep any cooling stuff plugged in).<br>
<br>
If your computer boots up and tells you it can't load an OS or find any hard drives, move to step two.  If nothing comes up try the other port on your graphics card.  If you're using a DVI to VGA adapter try the other one that came with the card.  If that doesn't work, your motherboard is probably pissed.  Investigate if your motherboard has any problems with PCIe ver 2.0 cards (see above for mobo identification).  Update the bios as needed.  If your monitor has both DVI and VGA inputs make sure it's on the right one (silly, yes, but always a possibility).<br>
<br>
2)  If your computer does boot and complains about there being no OS, plug in your main hard drive and restart.  If that works, gradually plug in any auxiliary hard drives and optical drives and any other stuff that you have (the most important things first).  If your computer fails to start at some point after your main drive is plugged in, your power supply is too weak to support all of your stuff and you'll probably need a new one.  And if you can avoid it, do not plug any other devices in on the same line from the power supply as your video card (I've had problems with this in the past).<br>
<br>
If that doesn't work, I have no idea what the issue could be.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes, GeekSquad sucks balls.  Just a bunch of 16 year olds who just got their A+ certification, don't give a shit about their job or you, and just need money to pay homeless dudes to buy booze (and/or midget porn) for them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I agree that your PSU is not a problem...decent one that is.<br>
<br>
By your last past, your mobo manufacturer is Biostar and the model of you mobo is P4M90-M7.  I can't find a P4M90-M7, I can only find a P4M900-M7 (the following reflects that)<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately there are three different versions of the mobo (with bios) that I can find... there is probably some differentiating factor between the three but I'm not in a condition to figure it out!:<br>
<br>
P4M900-M7 FE 7.x (bios: <a href="http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en-us/mb/bios.php?S_ID=314" class="postlink">http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en-us/mb/ ... p?S_ID=314</a>)<br>
<br>
P4M900-M7 SE 7.x (bios: <a href="http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en-us/mb/bios.php?S_ID=289" class="postlink">http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en-us/mb/ ... p?S_ID=289</a>)<br>
<br>
P4M900 Micro 775 6.x (bios: <a href="http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en-us/mb/bios.php?S_ID=99" class="postlink">http://www.biostar.com.tw/app/en-us/mb/bios.php?S_ID=99</a>)<br>
<br>
If you crack open your case and look for a P4M900 and some numbers after it on the PCB you should be able to find the exact product number.  <br>
<br>
After you do...use the following info to update your bios based upon the version of the motherboard you have above (if you can't match things up...someone else is going to have to have an idea):<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
make sure you have the right version though.  Flashing the bios with the wrong bios image can kill your motherboard.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It seems a BIOS update is the only option if that doesnt work new motherboard. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

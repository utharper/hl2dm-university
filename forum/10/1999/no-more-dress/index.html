It's always been that way, I don't see anything getting changed there since it hasn't already.<br>
I think the main thing is that players have learned how to optimize there settings as well as how to use the shotgun in a more effective way. Also more players are starting to realize just how powerful the shotgun can be if used properly, so its just getting used a lot more now. It's really not any worse than some of the other spam in the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is no secret, everything has been discussed here before. Optimize your net connection settings, aim for the head upper body area, some say charging forward while firing helps, some say hitting both mouse 1 and mouse 2 gives you a more concentrated blast, while others say its a placebo (but still do it anyway, lol)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I know for certain double barrel shotgun does 100/100 damage at most and that was at point blank range to the face. That's some serious damage and I've never been killed from a long range distance with it while having 100/100 or less. There may have been an instance where some1 was 10 ft. or so away and might've done 100 damage to me with the shotty.<br>
<br>
    I'm unsure if this triple shotgun thing is present in the game cause I've just heard talk and haven't seen demos or hard proof it does some outstanding damage from even long distances as some say. More shotgun kills may be frequent nowadays cause ppl started to realize the effectiveness of the shotty at close combat and never really saw it as a powerful weapon in the past.  <br>
<br>
     I don't see reason in leaving the game because of the shotgun. There are many ways to go about the game imo. Working on magnum accuracy, bow prediction shots and ricohets, and of course the g-guns, which acts as an offensive and defensive tool (defensive as in reflecting orbs/objects back at your enemy) And really? Do maps focus just on shotgun kills not physics, nades, smg nades, rpg, orbs, etc? Strategy and tactics are still relevant in this game. Many maps offer amush spots or blind spots you can hide to assasinate your enemy.<br>
<br>
     Other than that, movement is key. Do you wanna sit and stand there like a duck or an easy target as your enemy gives you a shotgun facial? Or you could just run away and/or move your feet and dance a little as to give yourself leverage to best your enemy? The shotgun is not an automatic weapon after all and has recoil and works well ONLY in close combat and does take skill/aim to knockout your enemy (headshot)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

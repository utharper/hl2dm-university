	<div class="content"><span style="color:#000080">Opinion this way -&gt; </span> Not sure how many HLDM fans are here but I have always found this game ultimately superior to HL2DM in almost every regard, The physics elements in hl2dm are almost a distraction to the possible speed and emphasis on predictive type gameplay.  Why am I bringing this up?<br>
<br>
Check out the current status on Black Mesa, if you have not kept up with this mod you should take a trip to the forums.  If you found HLDM: Source disappointing to the point of ridiculousness post,  these guys need some deathmatch fans to guide them in the right direction.<br>

A promising post on that link thread:<br>

<span style="color:#000080">cman2k;334153</span> <span style="color:#400000">I think you can expect BMDM (consider that coined) to be a bit more polished than the auto-magic conversion that HLDM: Source basically was, lol.<br>
<br>
Paul (lead programmer) and myself both worked on HL2CTF back in it's heyday.  It gave us a lot of experience with creating a polished multiplayer experience, learning about serious and casual players and what they want, communicating and iterating with our community, and designing fun gameplay.  <br>
<br>
I think you can expect a multiplayer experience that is both true to the original and takes all of those things into account, and more.  BMDM is not just a sidenote to the singleplayer...we take it very seriously and will use everything we love and we've learned to make it the best experience we can.</span></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">HLDM and HLDM:S are both great games and have devout followers guys. bugs.. there're bugs everywhere. even in hl2dm  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"><br>
in any event, i'm pretty sure both won't get ported over to OB. too much to do to make them do the jump and for what. HLDM is based on an engine completely different than Source (ep1 that is) and HLDM:S is a patch. and a bad one at that. i think they'll just leave them both as is and let fans play them the way they know and love them.<br>
and for the sake of the skeptics...most proly hl2dm WILL get ported over to OB. it is not a discontinued game, still being updated. Playerbase haven't dropped /changed really in over 3 years so if Valve wanted to kill it would have back in 05-06.<br>

Hmm...for some reason I thought Source was built from the ground up, completely from scratch. Even then though, it still is quite a bit different, if there is anything left of the Quake source in it - it should technically be able to re-create exact gameplay of HL1?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">HL1 more appropriately was in development between the time of Quake/Quake2 as such they had the quake engine to work off of and adding things from quake2 as well as their own. I never heard the term gold source until Source came out, then they started talking about HL1 as gold source. Same as kids who call HL1 1.6 which is CS and has nothing to do with HL1 since CS is a mod built on the HL1 engine. <br>
<br>
As far as BM, I really don't know its taken them 4 years to get to where they are. It will be cool to play the single player once. But the reality is all the old HLDM players are hyping up BM not so much because of reality but more out of hope that it will be what they wanted HL2 to be. Personally I wish for neither. HLDM/AG/HLE/OZ/Bubble/Sevs/WTFE were buggy, had issues and were not balanced I have gone back and tried them in the last year or so and I do miss some aspects but certainly not all. Although the whole game had one amazing factor, that was the tau cannon and long jump. But HL2DM took things to a whole new level with physics, be it cooking nades, fast balls, or a toilet to your head nothing could be more awesome and there is simply no way IMO you can in your right mind say that those things are a distraction. They are not a distraction they are the focus of the game. They are what sets it apart from every other cookie cutter FPS out there. They are what make the play ingenious. People in HL2DM do not just point and click they really have to think. They can use physics as shielding, as a tool to get somewhere, to block things or create traps, or as a weapon to kill. HLDM just did not have things that dynamic.<br>
<br>
If BM were to keep the physics of HL2, make it a much more polished game and incorporate the weapons of HL1 as well it may be a very interesting game. But if they just copy HL1 well I suppose I will try it but I do not think it will impress me. <br>
<br>
I have a dream of a game where I can use a gravity gun, a tau cannon and a portal gun all on the same map. Now that would be awesome, but this black mesa stuff just trying to bring back the past bores me. Its the future we are suppose to get more advanced more complicated not rehash the past, that is what the movie industry and id software does and that is why they suck. <br>
<br>
Also as with all games it really will not just be what they can do but how they polish it. HL2 Pro is a great example on paper it seems great you get the tau and lj on top of HL2 weapons in practice its just not good.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

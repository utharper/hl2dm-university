I used to play with the C buttons as move and the analog stick as look around, almost like using mouse in left hand ,it meant you always got max speed when speed strafing <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> and could aim much better.<br>
<br>
Got perfect darkl too which is the better game overall but I do prefer a spot of GE becasue the maps are better laid out i think.<br>
My entire PD times from 3 years ago  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> not sure if i have improved them since.<br>

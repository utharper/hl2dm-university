	<div class="content">Idk when I play WaW online on pc EVERY FUCKING server is either crouch only, bolts only, hardcore, or some ridiculous amount of players which is way too high for the stock maps played.  I play MW2 on the 36t and good fucking lord it is so much better than waw on pc.  I bet I would like mw2 better on pc (without dedicated servers) than waw because all the servers would be stock with no retarded ass rules.  The game has some of the dumbest hit detection in history to begin with so dedicated servers or no I see no difference in ping/lag.<br>
<br>
   It's similar to the days when hl2dm had a pub scene.  The majority of servers were either killboxes, low grav with or without ridiculous acceleration, sniper maps, or some other stupid style of play; so, I don't understand why there's so much bitching about it because IMO the average person/clan that runs a server are idiots and it just ruins the experience if I can't play the way <em class="text-italics">I</em> want to.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I'm happier this way because there's no more competition in pc gaming and I don't care about competition in games anymore besides hl2dm.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Have to agree with con about the loss of dedicated servers being a good thing. 99% of player run servers end up as horribly modified disasters running trash custom maps, which inevitably kills the pub scene and results in players who actually try stock settings freaking out and making big whining forum posts about movement hax or whatever because theyve never before left their custom 0/2000 g fullbright nubfestland.<br>
<br>
Not to mention serverside cheating/exploiting, which every league is much better off without.<br>
<br>
Long as this trend of the devs controlling the servers progresses into the players/clans actually being able to eventually rent said servers, and set them to locked/passworded state with just enough control to change basic stuff like time/frag limits etc- basically locking out changing anything that alters the core gameplay- then this is surely a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Now, absence of console, not so good. Unless they end up implimenting pretty much everything into the gui, that is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I totally disagree on the dedi server issue.  Honestly Ko, I dont see how you would agree with the nubbing down of a game, like they did with MW2.  Might as well go buy an XBOX and sell your PC.  Now you have rediculous pings, and the host has a huge advantage over all of the other players in the game, no console, no imagination, no freedom of choice.   It is a huge step backward for PC gaming.   Almost everyone I talk to that tries MW2 says its a huge fail.  Most of the reviews for it agree.  Also, it seems like IW recycled alot of MW coding and just nubbed it down to make MW2.   Its not worth the $60 they are charging for it. <br>
<br>
You cant compare MW2 to WAW because WAW is not even made by IW.  If you want to compare, compare to MW, most people that play COD prefer it to WAW.   Its a world of difference.  Yes there are some modded servers, but the vast majority of them are either stock or Hard core.  There are also ALOT of servers, more than HL2DM ever had.  It isnt hard to find a good one that is run by good people.  MW competative matches are run in Hard Core, so there are a lot of those around.  Also, here is a kicker: a match server has to run a TWL mod to set up matches, imagine that?   We have to face it, HL2DM is dead as far as competative play is concerned and its not coming back.   So if you still like competative play at all, you need to find another game for that outlet.    I have been playing alot of MW lately and I am looking forward to trying competative play in TWL.<br>
<br>
Yea Keefy, I heard about the LAN debacle.  Personally I think its funny as hell and is yet another example of the fail that MW2 is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nowhere did i agree with nubbing down games, mention MW2 at all, or condone the retarded listenserver system. I simply said any game is going to be better if players cant fuck up the gameplay or alter the servers to give them or their teammates unfair advantage. The best way to bring this about is for the devs to control the dedicated servers, and rent them out just as current server providers do. Nothing useful would be lost, just crap like fake clients, bots, malware motds, omgwtfbbq serverside mods, gravity/friction/wtfe changes, serverside cheating/exploiting and so on.<br>
<br>
The best part about that is that it would give the devs a continuous source of income, thus allowing the game to be regularly patched and infused with extra content, or allowing the devs to hold official money leagues/tournaments, all without forcibly charging all players an mmo-like monthly fee.<br>
<br>
If the above system were in force for hl2dm, its very likely none of us would be discussing mw2s failure at all, since we would probably all be scrimming regularly and practicing for the next 10k league cup, or at least pubbing on servers that all ran the same settings and werent crammed with plugins, scripts, shortbus sounds and fullbright maps made by droolie 10 year olds.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I did hear however some game haxors out there found some files and console commands that show there is some built in support for running dedicated servers,  - not sure how true or if that was even exactly what I read since it was a week or so ago.  <br>
<br>
WaW - dont play hardcore (even though it is more realistic- a BAR will drop anyone in the chest in 1 shot like RL)<br>
           bolts only = skillZ if u run around but its usually a long boring camp fest.<br>
           CTF = tons of fun and then some!  <br>
           Use your browser filters so you dont see bullshit servers-duh.<br>
<br>
Try playing the A8 ctf server, its the only one still running that I found under 100 ping for me, I use to frequent the c4-gaming ctf server which was probably the smoothest server I played in that game with the best hit reg.  But their server is done for now, they closed shop.  They were boycotting mw2 and now thats all the c4 guys play. LOL<br>
<br>
Alas, the game is slowing dying out though.  no doubt about that.  Guess I'm waiting on Bioshock 2 and a can of Premium Ball Bearing Grease to keep me entertained now.<br>

oh yeah, my WaW name is KillerJD, use to be Rachkir but I accidently deleted it when offline at a lan party.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Toulouse responded to criticism with a slightly tortured metaphor. "Wow, some of you think cheating a glitch is OK. Um. If I install my car stereo wrong and it disables my door locks, its not ok to STEAL MY CAR," he posted. Somehow I doubt cops are out there comparing car theft to grenade kills to Modern Warfare 2, but we'll let it slide. Using a glitch or a bug to gain advantage is against the Terms of Service, and defining glitches, bugs, and that advantage is solely up to Microsoft.<br>

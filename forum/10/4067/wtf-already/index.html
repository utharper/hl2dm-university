	<div class="content">well if the game is anything like the vid this version is gonna kick ass compared to l4d1<br>
<br>
first off the zombies which its safe to call them that now they are exhibiting missing limbs jawbones and eyes compared to l4d1 which is a major realism improvement<br>
<br>
next if you notice the pistol runs out of ammo facing that gimpy tank fucker<br>
<br>
and the melee mechanics are pretty different and it will be nice to see a difference to the attack style of, I know ill elbow these zombies off instead of nailing them in the head with the but of my rifle or pistol and hopefully this time it will have some quality textures cuz last 1 even on highest sucked balls texture wise<br>
<br>
this 1 is more <strong class="text-strong">Dawn</strong> of the dead (2004) style to it compared to Night of the living Dead (1968) style so I'm looking forward to it but I don't think I'm gonna purchase it anytime soon</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL.  The problem is everyone is nuts about zombies.<br>
<br>
Case in point:  At least 6 zombie games came out in 2008 and there are tons of zombie mods: zombie panic, zombie css, zombie DM, zombie this, zombie that.  WTF already!<br>
<br>
As far as Ep3: this was pretty much all I could find on it and this is dated as it is:<br>

my mom in the morning cuz if it takes her 6 shots of espresso to get started she has to have had no pulse that night<br>

and besides that i don't care about perfect realism how many combine have you seen in RL? but you will find humans smg's shotguns and physics some realism is good when it comes to games if i wanted more realistic then i would go on a homicidal rampage and take pictures of ppl assaulting me. after i attack them with a plumbers wrench</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Would be much cooler if this was a 25.00 expansion pack or something, then it's justifiable.  <br>
<br>
Although, the ai director 2.0 sounds pretty sweet.  I dont think the gameplay is what makes/made L4D so popular.  Its the genre, and it seems rather revolutionary in the FPS community.  I look forward to this new director changing the maps every time you play it, being smarter and all that other shit.  <br>
<br>
Does it do teh suck for modders/mappers who are devoting time to L4D only to have their work overlooked because of L4D2?  Sure it does.  Does that bother me, nah, I dont do either.  <br>
<br>
I can forsee Valve including all the original content of the first game into the 2nd.   Meaning, at some point I see a patch that will allow you to choose the old survivors, the maps will be there, and wut not.  Shit, may even be included when you buy it. But then again, I highly highly highly doubt it will come out Nov. 17th 2009.  They are just starting the cash crop again is all, we shall see this game in 2010, fall time.  And it will all be good.  <br>
<br>
For all who think the game is shit, due to the random nature of things or whatever your reason (most likely cuz u never got good)<br>
you should try playing a server with the CEVO mods, TWL mods, or any other league mod.  It makes the game much more level and then it totally depends on how good you and the team are, not how many kits you get.  Speaking off which, all pills...no kits...tank spawns every level, witch ever other level.  Makes it much funner and challenging.  <br>
<br>
The pub scene for this game will not last long at all, to much raging, people playing only4 infected turns, so many shitty servers, so many.  These ruin the game, and I think valve may realize this a bit.<br>
The comp scene is rather small atm, but getting much notice with money tourneys and wut not.  Dont be hating the game because you've had a couple bad experience with random mofos.  OMG THIS GAME SUCKS.  Why do I die when I attack 4 survivors by myself and i do no damage cuz I jumped 2 feet of the ground level at them?<br>
<br>
I view shit talk about L4D the same as nubs calling B-Hoppers haxs, scripts.  Its obvious you dont know wut your talking about.  I play the pubs and the game sucks...get friends and play together, co-ordinate attacks...game is fun. oh my.<br>

I think this is why,  l4d1 doesn't even have sdk,stv,server browsers yet.  We will see what happens people are going crazy over this.  I am sure they will have to take a step back and either rename it and call it an expansion or add a whole lot more then melee re-skins and weapon re-skins</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

this is my take anyway for what it's worth: <br>
Times are tough. business are on the low. this is happening all over the world. this situation dictates the rules. period.<br>
what this means is ALL developers are doing ALL they can to SECURE THE SALE. this means sure shots. this means focusing on their biggest target market = 9 to 15 yr old kids. not you. the older gaming community is not understanding we are not the gross. we are the lesser part. the minority.<br>
Formula is simple : kids like games &gt; kids ask mom and dad to buy them games &gt; new game comes out &gt; kids get game &gt; SALE. <br>

The pub scene for this game will not last long at all, to much raging, people playing only4 infected turns, so many shitty servers, so many.  These ruin the game, and I think valve may realize this a bit.<br>
The comp scene is rather small atm, but getting much notice with money tourneys and wut not.  Dont be hating the game because you've had a couple bad experience with random mofos.  OMG THIS GAME SUCKS.  Why do I die when I attack 4 survivors by myself and i do no damage cuz I jumped 2 feet of the ground level at them?<br>
<br>
I view shit talk about L4D the same as nubs calling B-Hoppers haxs, scripts.  Its obvious you dont know wut your talking about.  I play the pubs and the game sucks...get friends and play together, co-ordinate attacks...game is fun. oh my.<br>
<br>
L4D 2  is shitty though so soon. wow.  wall of text ftw  tldr  whoops, this is dm forum.</div></blockquote>

Times are tough. business are on the low. this is happening all over the world. this situation dictates the rules. period.<br>
what this means is ALL developers are doing ALL they can to SECURE THE SALE. this means sure shots. this means focusing on their biggest target market = 9 to 15 yr old kids. not you. the older gaming community is not understanding we are not the gross. we are the lesser part. the minority.<br>

	<div class="content">The HL series story has zombies in it but it is not based on zombies.  There are a lot of other antagonists (ant lions, bull squids, vortigaunts, headcrabs etc) in the story and some (the combine) take just as much of a role of not more.  <br>
 <br>
HL1 is about the incident at Black Mesa which opened a rift to another dimension called Xen.  Gordon has to fight against what is described as a "Military Death squad" and other aliens (vortigaunts, head crabs) to find and kill the Nihilanth which is keeping the rift open.  <br>
<br>
In HL2, the combine has conquered the Earth.  The "combine" forces we see that look like the military forces from HL1 appear to be a human based force.  So there is a bit of a hole in the story there to explain that relationship.<br>
<br>
Ep1 and Ep2 is about the human resistance's efforts to ultimately defeat the combine<br>

<a href="http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp" class="postlink">http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp</a><br>
<br>
Highlights of relavance<br>
<br>
1.U.S. computer and video game software sales grew 22.9 percent in 2008 to $11.7 billion – more than quadrupling industry software sales since 1996. <br>
2.Sixty-eight percent of American households play computer or video games. <br>
3.The average game player is 35 years old and has been playing games for 12 years. <br>
4.The average age of the most frequent game purchaser is 39 years old.<br>
5.Forty percent of all game players are women. In fact, women over the age of 18 represent a significantly greater portion of the game-playing population (34 percent) than boys age 17 or younger (18 percent). <br>
6.In 2009, 25 percent of Americans over the age of 50 play video games, an increase from nine percent in 1999.<br>
<br>
@ #1  I have heard it said that Video game sales have been one of the few items that have done better in this economy, not worse.  Games are cheap entertainment comparatively.  I would bet that EA's stock is down mostly because of the economy, and not so much because of a specific problem with them alone.  Pretty much all stocks are down and down hard right now.<br>
<br>
Here are a couple of facts that dont bode well for those of us that like computer games and FPS games:<br>
 In 2008:<br>
Game console software sales totaled $6.6 billion with 153.9 million units sold;<br>
Computer games sales were $910.7 million with 36.4 million units sold; and, <br>
There was a record $2.0 billion in portable software sales with 77.5 million units sold. <br>
<br>
The genre with the greatest growth was "Family Entertainment," which grew 110 percent over the previous year. Family games accounted to 17.2 percent of all games sold in 2007, more than one of every six games sold, up from 9.1 percent in 2006.   In addition, of the games sold in 2007, 56.6 percent were rated "Early Childhood (EC)," "Everyone (E)" and "Everyone 10+ (E10+)."  The NPD Group's data also indicates that only 15 percent of games sold last year were rated "Mature (M)."<br>
<br>
<br>
Alot of the game developers are investing in that family and console market.  Computer games and FPS games are a small segment of the market and may be on the way out it seems.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Game industry is growing and is said likely to out sell other forums of digital entertainment. I won't be surprised if it is already doing so, they also stated game industry will not be hit that hard by the economy down turn compared to other industries. Its mainly doing so because a game is seen as a good investment for your money and valve in terms of entertainment you get. <br>
<br>
Now frankly I am not at all too pleased every game I buy is a investment in my eyes and it sure as well has to be good quality as well have good game life span. This comes even more important in multiplayer based games such as L4D now I played it and stripped it for everything its has and only got 6 or so hours out of it before me and my m8 got tired of it. Now this to me is a poor investment and so what I was hoping is that valve would up hold on their commitment to add additional content free to their products like they do with TF2 which BTW they have said earns them more sales by adding more content to it which is very cheap to do than making a whole new release. This is a slap in the face from a development team which I can only describe as lazy rather than focusing and try get more work done to hl2:3 and bring forth the release date than wasted it on a remake of a game they recently released (recent in terms of how long sequel for games are usually taken) that probably little difference between the two other than game mode and weapons. I mean seriously these guys make good games but they should get their priorities sorted gaming community was more in want of hl2:3 than L4D2 a tarted up version of a game released year ago. What they should do is give PC owners a free upgrade to L4D2 that has L4D content as well just flog L4D2 a a separate game and let the xbox mugs get ripped off only.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have heard that in the current economy companies are becoming less willing to invest large amounts of corporate resources on large, development intensive and epensive to produce games.  Also it seems the shooter market may be tapped out and companies may now begin to develop games the know they can sell a million copies of for things like the Wii instead of 100,000 copies to PC gamers which makes me sad to think about.   Given the stats above and from what I have seen, I may have to break down and go buy a fucking xbox because there are games coming out for it that sound cool but they aren't  being released for PC  :'(<br>

	<div class="content">hehe. yea, this is a common mistake also done many times by Valve themselves. infected are diff from zombies in the sense zombies are living dead and infected are still alive and never died. until...the met my autoshotty. but hey now..they both act and look the same hence, i guess the mistake.<br>
btw, the "zombies" in HL aren't even zombies really. they are completely and most definitely dead. the headcrabs use their bodies as host to move around. shoot the "zombie" and you'll see the headcrab is still very active. <br>

All I can say is you don't know till you try. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> <br>

The fact is that the people here by and large do not play maps other than ld, lv, la, cav, etc.  I have seen it happen time and time again in both my own and other people's pubs.  Put caverns or lostvillage on and the server fills up, put anything other than the aforementioned list and the server empties out or you have a map other than those listed and someone comes in, plays 2 minutes and says "OMG this map sucks change it to *insert map name from list here*" and when you dont, they leave anyway.  Just the way it is.  Yes there are a few exceptions to that rule, but they are just that: few.<br>
<br>
There are people in the game that will play other maps and I am sure he will get a following from that sector because I have seen that there are people that do enjoy and like Mike's maps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

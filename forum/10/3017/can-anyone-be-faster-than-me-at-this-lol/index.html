The point is that he connected to a server and within 3 kills the other player started calling him a hacker.<br>
<br>
Skaruts, Yeah its sad that some players just think if you kill them you must be hacking, shows how nooby they are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nope. (I knew the title wasn't the best  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> )<br>
<br>
It's just that it happens every day. And like L2K, I only did 3 kills.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
I still die a lot with good players.<br>
<br>
Actually, I don't even consider myself a pro. More like an average player. The server I was in has many good players going there, but also many noobs. I went in hoping to find a good challange, but only got that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

But I think in most cases they're just highly misinformed and confuse asshopping with speedbot and lucky shots with aimbot. And in some, they don't even want to be informed.<br>

	<div class="content">yea, I felt like that in the first time(s). But it turned out to be pretty annoying so far. Sometimes it makes me think stuff like "wth am I getting better at this for?", "wtf do I still play pubs?", "wtf do I do I even care about this?", etc.<br>
<br>
I get better cuz I like to do things right, as in the game so in life in general, even though I play more for the fun than for the competition.<br>
I play pubs cuz I like them somehow, and I like the chalange of facing many random ppl at once and try to overcome it.<br>
I care about it cuz I'd like to face more and more good players that could make me push myself, and I can't understand why there's so much ppl unaware that in every single game there's ppl who tend to improve into a much higher level of consistency.<br>
<br>
While every question has it's answer they still come up in my head as a sort of dismotivation, in a way.<br>
<br>
What I can't understand at all, is those who won't even listen and try to be sure about the other player's means, either hacks or skills.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

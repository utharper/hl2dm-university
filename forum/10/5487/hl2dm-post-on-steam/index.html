Needless to say I got bored enough to start emailing people, and one of those people was Gabe Newell, I read around and apparently he usually answers all his email, or has some other peon do it, usually within 40 minutes too, but I emailed him around midnight. I won't post anything right now, but I'll post the whole email if I get a reply.<br>

Nice post too Juim, if I could remember how many c's I put in my username on the steam forums I'd post too.<br>

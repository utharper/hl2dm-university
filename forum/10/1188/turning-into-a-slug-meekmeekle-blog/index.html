	<div class="content">haha, it's been so cold out side the last month that I have not been going outside as much and I have not gotten much exercise at all .. and I'm the type of person who needs to walk around at least an hour a day.  WHOOPS.. this last week instead of doing just that I have been playing hl2dm instead.. and it's not good at all.  I ran around a bit outside a few ours ago and I felt dizzy and sluggish. WOW that sucks!!  So my goal is to not become a slug and exercise more!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My inherited hyperactive metabolism along with my heavy pot smoking ensures beyond a doubt that despite how sedentary I am or how much food i eat I do not gain a pound.  Really I think I'm at more a risk of my body consuming muscle mass, if I don't eat properly, than ever producing excess fat lol.  I would not be a good canidate for having to survive without food lol, my body would mow itself in a day.  I tried once for like 3 months to gain weight...didn't work the only thing I succeded in doing was greatly increase my capacity for food.  during that period I once consumed 7 full dinner plates of food at an all you can eat buffet without much pause for digestion.  God gave me the perfect body for my life style, I absolutely love gaming, so I have long sedentary periods, and I absolutely love over eating.  Theres nothing like feeling like your gonna burst at the seams. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  Mmmmm who else wants some turkey dinner right now, I know I do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm just like this.  Almost every time I am in front of the computer I am eating actually.  I like playing hl2dm and eating between deaths too. ( i'm eating hamburger, rice, broccoli and cashews right now  .. and it's not even my dinner / lunch )  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I am 20 to answer your question Valar.  Yeah I can't play and eat unless its something I can eat with a utensil, cause then it doesn't get on my keyboard/mouse.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">   I think eating really has to be one of the greatest pleasures in life.  Esspecially eating food you cooked, its just so much more satisfying when your the reason for awesome flavors. lol  Mmmmmm food, now that I think about it, I am totally making a huge batch of chilli on friday!  I love chili, and its even better to make, esspecially when your cooking the recipe you grew up on!!1  Mmmmmm nothin beats my mum's chili recipe.  Been like over a month since I've cooked a good batch of chili, awwww shit I just had the best idea!!  I'm gonna use buffalo instead of ground beef, mmmmm yeah buffalo has such a good flavor.  Awww man now i'm really excited!!  Lol damn I love food, and cooking for that matter!  That started to turn into the train of conciousness post cyberclash wrote up lol<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>MeekMeekle wrote:</cite>( i'm eating hamburger, rice, broccoli and cashews right now .. and it's not even my dinner / lunch ) 
</div></blockquote>  Mmm that sounds good.  Yeah I say fuck the conventional eating schedule, when I'm spending a lazy day at home on a day off, I usually eat just about all day.  Except I can't eat breakfast before 10am...makes my tummy feel weird lol.  Oh yeah and the best part about my inherited hypermetabolism is that my dad is exactly the same way and hes almost 60yrs old.  I bet he could acctually put down more food than I can.  when I was like 14-15 we were on vacation and he ate an entire 3lbs. bucket of seafood.  It was like the restraunts family meal on the menu and my dad ate the whole thing, whole lobster, mussles, clams, crab legs, scallops, ect. lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">To Epoch and Meekmeekle.  I was the same way when I was younger (20's).  I desperately tried gaining weight as I was always skinny.  I even tried WeightGainer 2200 for a while to no avail.  Trust me when I say this, the older you get, the easier it is to gain weight.  Now I have to watch what I eat as I need to lower my cholesterol and I need to lose some weight, about 10 pounds and I should be good.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hmmm sounds like I should really take advantage of this talent while I can lol.  I'm goin to the buffet tonight woohoo, nothing beats a good korean buffet (drools).  They even have sushi thats not scetchy lol, mmmm and all the strong ass green tea you can stomach.  Which is awesome cause at all the american buffets they try and serve you cold drinks which drastically slows down you digestion.  Nice hot liquids with a mild acidic content are the best so you don't dilute your stomach acid and keep your stomach warm, which inscreases blood flow and helps soften the food.  awww crap I totaly forgot about chili....hmmmmmm chili or buffet.  I bet this is the biggest decision I make all day.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, do that. For me the turning point was around 30, or it might have been having my first kid and not getting enough sleep and exercise. Don't get me wrong, I would still be considered thin for my height, but I am about 15 pounds heavier than I was in my 20s and not the bottomless pit I used to be, hehe.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<strong class="text-strong">Problem hosting games</strong> (some people needed to do this, others, not at all.. weird.)<br>
<br>
like many other online multiplayer games, requires that you forward a few ports if you plan on hosting a game. This basically means that if you want people to join your game you need to open up a path in your internet connection for them to get there, otherwise you'll be left to loot all by your lonesome.<br>
<br>
But don't worry! This is a pretty easy thing to do!<br>
<br>
First, determine whether or not these ports are already open<br>
There are some cases where port forwarding is unnecessary, such as when you connect directly to a single port cable or DSL modem.<br>
<br>
To test for this just click each of the following links, it will tell you if the port is open or not.<br>
<br>
7777<br>
28900<br>
27900<br>
28910<br>
<br>
<br>
If the ports were closed, we need to determine what kind of router you're using<br>
You'll need to find the model name of the router or router/modem combo you're using. This shouldn't be too hard. Usually, the internet comes in through your modem (box connecting to the wall either through phone line or cable line) and is then passed to a router which sorts and distributes your internet connection to the computers in your house. Go find the latter, turn it over, and look for a brand name and some kind of model number (Ex.: Linksys wrt54g, D-link DI-804). Once you have that go to this link and locate your model:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://portforward.com/" class="postlink">http://portforward.com/</a><br>
<br>
Follow the instructions provided. The ports you need to open are:<br>
<br>
7777 (TCP/UDP)<br>
28900 (TCP)<br>
27900 (UDP)<br>
28910 (TCP)<br>
<br>
Once you're done click each port to test if it's really forwarded. Bear in mind that sometimes it takes a minute for the router settings to apply.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The ending is bad, but then again if you play this for the storyline, it's sad.<br>

Solo is a bit easy, the more people ingame the tougher it gets, gota coordinate attacks and call targets and whatnot.<br>

if all else fails, I had all ports forwarded too, and somehow it wouldn't let me, edge told me to try the folowing :<br>

A weapon can have up to 5 stats, the game as it is now, only shows 4 lines, and those 4 are sometime used to the weapon description.<br>

Example of what the stats of a weapon should be:<br>

<em class="text-italics">Annihilate 'em bandits<br>

40% crit damage<br>

you dont need to "forward" ports if you're not using a router. forwarding ports mean you're opening ports on a router or similar device and pointing them to a specific LAN ip adress.  if you are just using windows firewall all you need to do is open the ports needed.  it sounds like you have already done that.  some ppl are having issues even with the correct ports open, check the steam borderlands forum for some tips that have worked for ppl.  hit me up on steam tonight if you still cant get it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not necessarily true.<br>
<br>
If you have no router and you are wired in right to your cable modem, it just depends on if your cable modem is using NAT. Many cable modems do these days and if so your ISP will have to open the ports on the modem unless they let you have access to it, my isp does not. When I talked to my isp about this they suggested I get a router and they will disable the NAT on the modem and I can control the ports myself. Before borderlands I never had a need to do this so the 4 port cable modem had worked just fine.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No, Huxley looked like it had alot of replay value, this isn't the case. Borderlands is for people that enjoy singleplayer games in general. Wich I'm a fan of. It's just more awesome that you can play it online. If you play it for the "mp" or "looking leet" you've been misled and shouldnt play this game.<br>
<br>
If you want a leet game get TFC.. oh wait :l no one plays it anymore... except for this sunday &gt;:D</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

TF2 still seems more fun. You can do this with a demoman. (For those who weren't aware)<br>
<br>
what about prop jumping and phys haxin in hl2? Tiggyboard sawblade flying anyone?<br>
<br>
Sorry but Borderlands kinda looks like Boringlands.<br>
<br>
Anyone know if borderlands is huxley with a different title because I'm almost certain they're the same game.</div></blockquote>

No, Huxley looked like it had alot of replay value, this isn't the case. Borderlands is for people that enjoy singleplayer games in general. Wich I'm a fan of. It's just more awesome that you can play it online. If you play it for the "mp" or "looking leet" you've been misled and shouldnt play this game.<br>
<br>
If you want a leet game get TFC.. oh wait :l no one plays it anymore... except for this sunday &gt;:D</div></blockquote>

for me, obviously, its not about being leet.  its about playing against other humans rather than AI.  thats the aspect of multiplayer that appeals to me most.  the dynamics of human intelligence and skill.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

My only big issues is when people edit their files, such as if i were to edit a weapon and give it parts it wasn't supposed to have then host, it will corrupt peoples game saves at random times. Another issue is that because everything is stored locally, there will be no PVP that is really worth anything. (So it loses PVP to the Diablo series by far.)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Try playing in a party of 3-4 the game has coding that says, per player the game gets 100% harder, if wanted you can host and make it 6x stronger too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I guess Im just not a fan of single player games period. Never really have been as the majority that I have played have just sucked. In fact, Half Life 2 is about the only one that I can recall that I can still say, shit I'd play that again for sure. I've played AI long enough, multiplayer is where it's at.

We have discussed this before and its not silly at all.  My disks never get scratched, lost, stepped on or eaten by the dog.  I have never lost a music CD, movie DVD or game disk.  I take care of them and when Im not using them they go back to their home on the shelf.  I also dont lend them out to people because I have gotten burned that way with books I have lent out.  I dont want to have to redownload 20 fucking games whenever I have to reinstall windows or a drive dies, or whatever.  It takes 10 minutes to load a game disk where it takes hours to download a game from steam.  I dont want to sell them really, I just dont want to have to redownload them all again and again.  I can reinstall all the games I want in an afternoon whereas they will take a week to download.  I want to play them, not watch a download bar.  To each his own.  Also if the governor of NY has his way, he is going to tax DLC so thats another reason to have a disk.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well as a political geek I should let you know no actual picture of his dead body is yet to be released, the White House will likely release it "soon". The two most famous fakes are one from 4chan 2 years ago, another is a more a recent fake from the movie "Black Hawk Down".<br>

This is not yet declassified, we buried him at sea in an attempt to follow their religious beliefs and stay on the moral high ground as a simple show of professionalism. Even though we got it wrong it's supposedly the thought that counts.<br>

	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">Let's consider the logistics of a mission failure followed by a coverup.<br>
<br>
Osama Bin Laden clearly has access to the internet, and the ability to speak on his behalf through media bodies (I assume nobody will reject publishing an official Bin Laden tape) why then would he not jump at the chance to shove our foot in our mouth?<br>
<br>
He would love nothing more than to bring such a scandal into light, how would we have convinced a radical Islamic self proclaimed prophet to keep quiet? The usual suspect is money, Bin Laden is and has been a billionaire for the duration of his entire life, even if he weren't there are more than a hand full of supporters to his cause that would have funded him regardless of intention or request.<br>
<br>
The man is dead, he was a tactical fool residing in Abbottobad unless of course he was allowed but that's another story, I believe the man felt more comfortable with his freedom, I compare the years ranging from 2001 throughout 2006 when he was releasing videos from minute cave systems that littered a mountain range (be it Afghanistan or Pakistan that's irrelevant) to our discovery that he had taken refuge in a mansion compound in a wealthy Pakistani City, my hypothesis is he felt less threatened when the Bush administration dissolved the committee in charge of his uncovering. <br>
<br>
Bush also stated that Bin Laden was no longer the figure of power he initially was and shouldn't be considered the threat he initially was during the start of the "war on terror" campaign, I believe Bin Laden had above average intelligence but not to the point where he could grasp the reach of our intelligence agencies.<br>

Agreed.<br>
<br>
Btw, I think condecorating SEAL Team Six for that, it's an insult for the rest of the SEALs who have tons of risky missions like rescueing captured soldiers in enemy territory and stuff.

I recently learned that seal team division six features all branches of military not just the Navy as I assumed. Neat, I still haven't seen proof of this though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

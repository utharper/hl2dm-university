	<div class="content">Hey guys and gals,<br>
<br>
I recently purchased a new MB, RAM and CPU (MB=Gigabyte GA-EP45-UD3P) and I'm confused out of my mind.  I throw in my Windows XP Pro CD and boot up to it.  It makes it to the point of "Windows will now begin setup", then BSOD.  It comes up with PCI.SYS which according to the web means my WinXP needs a service pack already in the bundle.  I have an old version of WinXP with no SP's.  Now, I can throw in my old Windows 2000 Pro and it works with no problems, but I don't want to run Win2000 LOL!  Anybody else ever have an issue like this and if so, what took care of it?  What about slipstreaming XP with a service pack, anyone tried that and were successful?  Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I just finished a build with that exact board.<br>
<br>
One of the issues I had was that setup wasn't recognizing the SATA drive, even though an SP2 disk is supposed to. I had to fool with a workaround, you may have to as well. <br>
<br>
I would suggest using the 2000 disk just to format the drive ( I usually give the OS its own partition ) and then exit to retry the XP cd. Try to get the SATA drivers from the Gigabyte disk onto a floppy so you press f6 when it asks for RAID or 3rd party drivers. Also enable USB keyboard support in the bios as soon as you can, I had to use a ps/2 keyboard just to access the bios the first time.<br>
<br>
glhf...once you get it going I think youll be happy with the board...although the dual lan ports are useless for gaming...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for the info.  A friend of mine just got back to me with the exact same problem a while back.  He said I definitely need XP with SP2 already bundled with it.  I was thinking I could throw my hard drive in an older system, load XP and only install the LAN driver so I can download the SP's then put the drive back in my new system.  Do you think that would work??</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">don't recommend switching motherboards on a win install. I did it once to see what would happen and it wasnt pretty. Maybe the issue is that your XP cd predates the existence of PCI-express.<br>
<br>
If you're gonna DL the sp's then you might want to look into slipstreaming anyway, will be better in the long run. I don't know how that works but I imagine it's possible.<br>

From what I've seen/read windows 7 is windows vista with some new features, like a less annoying UAC, debateable performance increases,<br>
media streaming (which requires windows 7 to be running on both ends, LOL), built in ISO burner, improved windows paint, new calculator (scientific), revised windows search, and XP mode(virtual pc anyone?).  All of these things you can get for free w/o Windows 7 I might add.<br>

Is windows 7 a new OS?  Or just the Vista they should've released a long time ago?  Its got a new recent documents, a directorie structure labeled Libraries, easier time setting up a home network 'HomeGroup', and one-click wi-fi, and a new interface when hooking up external devices.  Oh yea, those are the things you can't get for your vista and xp, but the rest of windows 7 you can have in vista with some tweaks, while xp is more limited</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think that is pretty much the bottom line, it is the fixed version of vista with a few tidbits added in to make it seem like something new. I skipped vista but now that games are progressing I plan to run a dual boot xp x64 / win 7 x64 set up to start enjoying dx 10/11 and 6 gb's of ram.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, just like DX10 is exclusive to Vista.<br>

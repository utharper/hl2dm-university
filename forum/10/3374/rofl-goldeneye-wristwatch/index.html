	<div class="content">SO back in 97 NINTENDO POWER magazines had this offer where you had to send a bunch of barcodes of nintendo power issues and 20 $ and you'd get a fully working, metal Goldeneye Wirstwatch replica (with the orange and blue health bars like in the game) and a 007 hologrm in the middle. I was cleaning my room and opening old boxes of what was mostly useless junk kept off souvenirs and nostalgia.<br>
<br>
And i found that watch, i can't find anything about it on google, i'm sure it has some kind of value, th only thing i could find was a guy who was actually looking for it, ready to pay 150$ from some guy and he was hoping the guy wouldnt end up selling it at <strong class="text-strong">COLLECTOR PRICE</strong><br>
<br>
i'm tempted as fuck to put it on ebay but on the other hand, i kinda wanna make sure what is this collector price and should i or not wait.<br>
<br>
Anyone ever sold anything ''collectible'' on Ebay? I need some advice TY</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

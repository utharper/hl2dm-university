the fact that you havent spent two minutes on the internet trying to answer your questions tells me you dont have an open mind at all.  you'd rather spend two minutes on an american gaming forum pretending you're not trolling.<br>
<br>
i'll use a little common sense and some internet info.  a commercial airliner traveling at 540 mph crashed into wtc2 between the 80th and 83rd floor.  fifty minutes later, a sporadic flow of a glowing liquid is observed flowing out the 80th floor for 7 minutes minutes before the wtc2 collapse.  rather than believing 200 technical experts, thousands of interviews with eyewitnesses on the scene, and reviews of over 14,000 video segments and photographs, concluding the glowing liquid was most likely melted metal alloys from the plane itself... you believe what exactly?  based upon what you viewed on tv for a few minutes?  what exactly is it that your genius engineering uncle concluded from watching tv coverage for a few minutes while being thousands of miles away from the scene?<br>
<br>
molten metal in the debris weeks later?  think of the sheer volume of debris contained in those buildings.  think of the types of materials in those buildings.  now imagine the pressure created with thousand of tons of debris.  now do a little research into how iron burns.  you know, oxidation... the chemical process.  and the reactive natures of iron, gypsum, pressure, water, air, and heat... and so many other materials and chemical reactions combined.  what do you come up with?  what exactly is your theory?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You can argue alot of points against the 9/11 conspiracy but the government not being to keep secrets is not one of them....<br>
<br>
The Navajo code talkers were held a secret for 40+ years, and the government would probably still hold them classified if it wasn't for historians who started to record and publish the Navajo language in the 60's.<br>
<br>
Hoover who disliked both Eisenhower and JFK had information up the ass (probably literally too) about extramarital affairs and illegal contracting of Eisenhower and records of JFK's dozens of affairs under Hoovers surveillance. Only problem was that Hoover was under surveillance himself and Presidents had proof he was involved in homosexual affairs, so it became a Mexican standoff where everybody agreed to just remain quiet.<br>
<br>
Just two examples before I go to school, but there are hundreds of examples were the government can keep secrets, and there are many secrets we will never know to this day about the FDR administration for example classified under national security imperative. The "gubbmint" can keep secrets if the secrets threaten themselves.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
First off, nobody is talking about a beneficial Code project from the 1940s.<br>
That isn't a conspiracy and my point was about large scale gubbmint conspiracies and keeping secrets.<br>
<br>
The FBI has information on people. WOW, really!?!? I had no idea.<br>
Also, not a conspiracy but law enforcement.<br>
<br>
What i am talking about is the notion that Bush/Gubbmint/Trilateral commish whatever played a role in murdering American citizens on 911, which is nonsense.<br>
Also all the ignorant debunked nonsense about building 7 and squibs and the jet never crashing into the Pentagon.<br>
<br>
Zeitgeist is filled to the brim with half truths, tenuous silly connections and mountains built on molehills.<br>
The gubbmint couldn't even waterboard some hardcore terrorists without it printed in the NYTimes.<br>
<br>
Here is another bullshit concerning 911: bin Laden family flew out while all flight was suspended.<br>
Patently UNTRUE. FBI, 911 commish, and Richard Clarke testify otherwise.<br>
<br>
The gubbmint did not detonate any explosives at ground Zero.<br>
Bush did not know of a specific attack and let it happen.<br>
There is no COMMISSION/Shadow gubbmint in charge of everything.<br>
There is no Bilderberg Conspiracy, just a meeting of Who's who.<br>
Conspiracy people are pathetic pinheads.<br>
Please stop acting like real life is a Hollywood movie starring Mel Gibson and black helicopters.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You got that right, he's an idiot and often Presidents are withheld from information on purpose. The NSA and CIA both had tracked all of the 9/11 hijackers, the NSA specifically was tracking them until the day before 9/11, where the NSA had a massive database failure on 9/10 and lost their tracking information on them. See this <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;projects_and_programs=complete_911_timeline_yemen_hub" class="postlink">http://www.historycommons.org/timeline. ... _yemen_hub</a><br>
<br>
Those sequence of events are all recorded from forced document release through the Freedom of Information Act, all provided by the government themselves, no conspiracy. Did the gubbmint do 9/11? Fucknah. Did they "accidently" let it happen? Probably.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ditto<br>
<br>
Anyone that seriously believes that the WTC came down because of anyhting other than planes hitting them really needs to stop drinking the conspiracy Koolade.  TWO FUCKING PLANES HIT THE BUILDINGS!  There are hundreds if not thousands of pictures and videos of it.  100s of 1000s of people if not millions saw it live on TV and in person.  It would have taken literally months to sneak in enough explosives to take down those buildings.  There is no way it would have gone unnoticed.  Jet Planes are made of predominantly aluminum, the building was built with steel.  Alumiunum melts at 660 deg C/1220 deg F while steel melts at 1370 deg C/ 2500 deg F.  Molten metal coming out of the buildings before they collapsed was from the planes.  There was relatively little metal left from those planes.  The temperatures were high enough to weaken the steel to the point where it got soft and could no longer support the buildings.  The condition of the steel after the fact showed exactly what happened.  The rest is just fucking bullshit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i'll use a little common sense and some internet info.  a commercial airliner traveling at 540 mph crashed into wtc2 between the 80th and 83rd floor.  fifty minutes later, a sporadic flow of a glowing liquid is observed flowing out the 80th floor for 7 minutes minutes before the wtc2 collapse.  rather than believing 200 technical experts, thousands of interviews with eyewitnesses on the scene, and reviews of over 14,000 video segments and photographs, concluding the glowing liquid was most likely melted metal alloys from the plane itself... you believe what exactly?  based upon what you viewed on tv for a few minutes?  what exactly is it that your genius engineering uncle concluded from watching tv coverage for a few minutes while being thousands of miles away from the scene?<br>
<br>
molten metal in the debris weeks later?  think of the sheer volume of debris contained in those buildings.  think of the types of materials in those buildings.  now imagine the pressure created with thousand of tons of debris.  now do a little research into how iron burns.  you know, oxidation... the chemical process.  and the reactive natures of iron, gypsum, pressure, water, air, and heat... and so many other materials and chemical reactions combined.  what do you come up with?  what exactly is your theory?</div></blockquote>

Your not telling me anything i havent heard b4.<br>
Witnesses on the scene have said alot of strange things, i know, because i saw it live.<br>
The amount of molten metal that was under the rubbel doesnt add up to me. <br>
Also where is this stuff on conspiracy theory debunking, i remember watching something like that but its been so long. If i could get one that explains the molten metal in detail that would be great.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol, poverty and the extreme gap between rich and poor are inevitable side effects of capitalism, a society based on profit and having more money than the other guy. injecting any amount of money into the economy will not fix that. it's really not that mindblowing, when everyone wants the most money, the poor are going to be exploited by the rich.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There are two different Zeitgeist movies.  Pern, you're talking about the 1st one, and Creature is talking about the Addendum.  The original starts with the religion stuff and goes over 9/11.  Addendum starts with the monetary system and goes over some other shit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Whatever explains it is NOT that fucking Thermite charges were planted in the towers or Building 7 by Fucking Bush or Cheney or the Illuminati or the Lions Club or the Masons or the Trilateral Lizard Commission or G. Gordon Liddy or Mr. Rogers or Aliens or Dimensional Travels or North Korean Agents or Bilderberg World Socialists or the Skull and Crossbones.<br>
<br>
If you read the site posted in this thread, it was mentioned by engineers that the temperature could have been higher than 800 degrees. Also, maybe because the fire is 80 stories high, on the coast, and WINDY UP THERE, maybe oxygen being fed through the building caused higher temps.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any claim from anyone that steel melted in the towers!??!!<br>
<br>
In life, the simplest explanation is usually the answer.<br>
In Conspiracy Theorists heads, anything not immediately explained, even the tiniest thing, is a clue some international/intergovernmental conspiracy/War Profiteering/Hindenburg/Rockefeller/Grassy Knoll/Shadow Gubbmint takeover is happening.<br>

It would have taken literally months to sneak in enough explosives to take down those buildings.  There is no way it would have gone unnoticed.  Jet Planes are made of predominantly aluminum, the building was built with steel.  Alumiunum melts at 660 deg C/1220 deg F while steel melts at 1370 deg C/ 2500 deg F.  Molten metal coming out of the buildings before they collapsed was from the planes.  There was relatively little metal left from those planes.  The temperatures were high enough to weaken the steel to the point where it got soft and could no longer support the buildings.  The condition of the steel after the fact showed exactly what happened.  The rest is just fucking bullshit.</div></blockquote>

If a plane could do it then surely strategically placed explosives could do it XD Just sayin.<br>
Also if u read my post again it was the amount of molten metal in the clean up that gave me pause, the crap spewing from the building was just a seemingly odd thing i noticed.<br>
I dont take this all very seriously and dont invest anything in it but considering all the odd facts and the odd things ppl have said at the scene it wouldnt surprise me if there were some truth to the conspiracy theories, its a complicated world.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What a load of nonsense. The purpose of money/capital is exchange and value. Nothing about Capitalism is evil. Greed is something PEOPLE sink to. This crap is offensive and ignorant Marxist nonsense. There isn't another system of exchange or social order that comes close to creating wealth and allowing the poor mobility upwards like liberty and capitalism. Frankly, you can kiss my ass with that "Values are fucked up" spew. Maybe YOUR values are fucked up, so speak for yourself.<br>
<br>
Economic Slavery!?!? That is the stupidest shit i have ever heard. It makes a mockery of slavery and is a completely ludicrous stupid view of America and Capitalism. You want to talk about economic slavery, talk about North Korea or the Soviet Union. Why don't you ask the Slavs about economic slavery.<br>
<br>
Jeeez, we live in the freest wealthiest most ethnically diverse liberal culture in history and these young dummies are talking about how fucked up our values are and economic slavery.<br>

Although I personally don't believe the government crafted 9/11 I still don't mind people who question, and continue to question events behind things that lead us to war.<br>
<br>
Is anyone old enough to remember the Golf of Tonkin incident that turned public opinion to start war against Vietnam? In 2005 the NSA concluded this...<br>
<br>
"In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded[7] that the Maddox had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the incident of August 4. The report stated:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">t is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. [...] In truth, Hanoi's navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on August 2"<br>
<br>
<br>
It's always better to question then to flatly believe the media and government like a pack of blind sheep. Another example... It's been declassified the government had knowledge about attacks being planned in the area of Hawaii, but did not act upon it appropriately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_advance-knowledge_debate" class="postlink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harb ... dge_debate</a></em></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This thread was boring and i still could not get anyone to explain in detail the steamjet theory. If ur going to argue with a troll Para u should atleast adress the main point at hand gosh.</div></blockquote>

You did say your uncle was a conspiracy theorist:
 <blockquote><div><cite>Pernicious wrote:</cite>Then years later watching some of these conspiracy theory movies they do bring up some very good questions, for me the main one of course is the molten metal(how?), i know it was there, theres no bullshit about it.THEN i hear my uncle, who is an Engineer and a literal genius(i shit u not) is one of these conspiracy theorists</div></blockquote>

I dont really care who your uncle is.  Now you are saying hes fucking Nostradomus?   The way things have been the last few years, anyone can say the US will go to war with someone and be right.  Even a blind man could see it was going to happen.<br>
<br>
Your Uncle has a degree and a job in what field of engineering?  Your Uncle not examine the evidence personally, did not work on the construction, design, engineering of the WTC buildings, is not a demolitions expert, is not a forensics expert.    There have been numerous documentaries featuring many many experts that looked at the actual physical evidence and Im sure some of those just happen to have an engineers degree.   Having an engineers degree doesnt mean shit.  An engineers degree does not make him an expert witness or an expert in the causes of an particular event while watching it on TV.  Only thing it means is he that he MAY have little bit more knowledge about what MIGHT be going on with the materials physically under those conditions than some guy off the street.    For him to say the WTC attack was anything other than 2 Boeing 767s, loaded with fuel, hitting two buildings which were designed to take a hit from a 727 (much much smaller plane) is just blowing smoke.   Many so called geniuses also have a propensity towards megalomania.<br>
<br>
BTW of course you get an emotional respose from Americans.  It was a horrible event .  I live in NY and Ill tell you  that people were very upset and afraid when it happened.  One woman I worked with at the time was on the verge of panic.  Everyone felt helpless.   Most people where I live knows someone that died in that event.   My neighbor is a NYC fireman and he had a very rough time afterwards because many of his friends are now dead.  It is not something that should be trivialized.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't mind considering conspiracies (one of my favorites is water fluoridation). But I can't believe you're saying that there is no answer to the molten metal thing. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">11. Why do some photographs show a yellow stream of molten metal pouring down the side of WTC2 that NIST claims was aluminum from the crashed plane although aluminum burns with a white glow?<br>
<br>
NIST reported (NCSTAR 1-5A) that just before 9:52 a.m., a bright spot appeared at the top of a window on the 80th floor of WTC 2, four windows removed from the east edge on the north face, followed by the flow of a glowing liquid. This flow lasted approximately four seconds before subsiding. Many such liquid flows were observed from near this location in the seven minutes leading up to the collapse of this tower. There is no evidence of similar molten liquid pouring out from another location in WTC 2 or from anywhere within WTC 1. <br>
<br>
Photographs, and NIST simulations of the aircraft impact, show large piles of debris in the 80th and 81st floors of WTC 2 near the site where the glowing liquid eventually appeared. Much of this debris came from the aircraft itself and from the office furnishings that the aircraft pushed forward as it tunneled to this far end of the building. Large fires developed on these piles shortly after the aircraft impact and continued to burn in the area until the tower collapsed. <br>
<br>
NIST concluded that the source of the molten material was aluminum alloys from the aircraft, since these are known to melt between 475 degrees Celsius and 640 degrees Celsius (depending on the particular alloy), well below the expected temperatures (about 1,000 degrees Celsius) in the vicinity of the fires. Aluminum is not expected to ignite at normal fire temperatures and there is no visual indication that the material flowing from the tower was burning. <br>
<br>
Pure liquid aluminum would be expected to appear silvery. However, the molten metal was very likely mixed with large amounts of hot, partially burned, solid organic materials (e.g., furniture, carpets, partitions and computers) which can display an orange glow, much like logs burning in a fireplace. The apparent color also would have been affected by slag formation on the surface. </span></div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">13. Why did the NIST investigation not consider reports of molten steel in the wreckage from the WTC towers?<br>
<br>
NIST investigators and experts from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) and the Structural Engineers Association of New York (SEONY)—who inspected the WTC steel at the WTC site and the salvage yards—found no evidence that would support the melting of steel in a jet-fuel ignited fire in the towers prior to collapse. The condition of the steel in the wreckage of the WTC towers (i.e., whether it was in a molten state or not) was irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse since it does not provide any conclusive information on the condition of the steel when the WTC towers were standing. <br>
<br>
NIST considered the damage to the steel structure and its fireproofing caused by the aircraft impact and the subsequent fires when the buildings were still standing since that damage was responsible for initiating the collapse of the WTC towers. <br>
<br>
Under certain circumstances it is conceivable for some of the steel in the wreckage to have melted after the buildings collapsed. Any molten steel in the wreckage was more likely due to the high temperature resulting from long exposure to combustion within the pile than to short exposure to fires or explosions while the buildings were standing.</span></div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If there were more convincing pictures of the molten steel, conspiracy theorists would be all over them and make sure that they're easily accessible to people.<br>

It appears that people have done the math and there's no way the site could have gotten that hot without thermite or something similar. That leave basically two options.<br>
1.Thermite or some other demolition material was used, this explains the molten steel<br>
2.There was no molten steel. The very few pictures that were taken are probably other melted materials. How would someone at the site know how hot it was burning anyways?<br>

Government organizations have basically taken #2, that's why there's not really much they can say to explain it.<br>

See my comment about how conspiracy theorists make me sick to my stomach. It's like arguing with a wall that's programmed to just say the same shit over and over even when confronted with overwhelming evidence <br>
<br>
I was at a Belle &amp; Sebastian show and Stuart Murdoch was giving a mini-commentary on American politics from a British perspective, and he said something like "You know, over in Britain, we don't hate government. In fact, we like it when government does good things for us." I feel like all you clowns just live in some 17th century conceived philosophical world without government where people will magically get along with each other. Let me guess, you think businesses would act ethically and the godly free market will save us all without government restriction, too?<br>

If there were more convincing pictures of the molten steel, conspiracy theorists would be all over them and make sure that they're easily accessible to people.<br>

It appears that people have done the math and there's no way the site could have gotten that hot without thermite or something similar. That leave basically two options.<br>
1.Thermite or some other demolition material was used, this explains the molten steel<br>
2.There was no molten steel. The very few pictures that were taken are probably other melted materials. How would someone at the site know how hot it was burning anyways?<br>
<br>
Government organizations have basically taken #2, that's why there's not really much they can say to explain it.<br>

Well considering how long the cleanup took, u can bet that the ppl involved were over the trauma of it well b4 they finished. Also if u watched alot of the cleanup u can tell just by all the steam coming out from where they are digging that there are pockets of it all over, as the guy said "its been like this since day 1". Wasnt exactly trauma stricken. <br>
Most of the footage i saw in the cleanup i dont think i'll ever see again, i remember seeing footage of excavators lifting metal up and molten metal would pour off the end of it, the only reason it was on the news i think was because of the reporters own curiousity /shrugs. And i think it served as filler as it wasnt a main focus point. I did see though several different reports of molten metal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
the very first link is <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/moltensteel.htm" class="postlink">http://www.debunking911.com/moltensteel.htm</a><br>
<br>
the first half of the page discusses the molten metal cascading from the south tower shortly before collapse.  the second half of the page discusses the molten metal in the debris piles.  i understand that u r too lazy to have made any effort to read through to the second half of the page.  i now understand u r also too ignorant to understand what a hyperlink is, like the one in the second sentence of the web page "molten steel found under ground zero".<br>
<br>
here's some other helpful links...<br>

...a huge pile of iron beams (e.g., mixed in with tons of other materials initially burning) can itself begin to burn like huge iron logs in a pile furnace, and there is no reason not to expect this system to reach a temperature high enough to melt iron.   Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) gas, released from burning organic materials, and/or from decomposing Gypsum, in the burning piles will spontaneously combine (react) with cold or hot iron, adding more heat to the iron, and adding "sulfides" to the steel and thus lowering its effective melting temperature.<br>
 <br>
The first "molten" iron in the WTC piles was reportedly discovered WEEKS AFTER the collapse of the WTC towers, and molten iron was reportedly found regularly during the following MONTHS during excavations of the huge piles.   The only rational explanation for this steady-state phenomenon is IRON BURNING...<br>

Not true. it was reported on the day by fire fighters. check out <a href="https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8852474886137017736#docid=-8182697765360042032" class="postlink">Richard Gage's vid</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Eyewitness accounts after traumatic events like 9/11 are extremely shaky ground, especially when giving accounts years afterward.

If there were more convincing pictures of the molten steel, conspiracy theorists would be all over them and make sure that they're easily accessible to people.<br>
<br>
It appears that people have done the math and there's no way the site could have gotten that hot without thermite or something similar. That leave basically two options.<br>
1.Thermite or some other demolition material was used, this explains the molten steel<br>
2.There was no molten steel. The very few pictures that were taken are probably other melted materials. How would someone at the site know how hot it was burning anyways?<br>
<br>
Government organizations have basically taken #2, that's why there's not really much they can say to explain it.<br>
It's similar to how the government doesn't acknowledge alien UFOs or Bigfoot.</div></blockquote>

Well considering how long the cleanup took, u can bet that the ppl involved were over the trauma of it well b4 they finished. Also if u watched alot of the cleanup u can tell just by all the steam coming out from where they are digging that there are pockets of it all over, as the guy said "its been like this since day 1". Wasnt exactly trauma stricken. <br>
Most of the footage i saw in the cleanup i dont think i'll ever see again, i remember seeing footage of excavators lifting metal up and molten metal would pour off the end of it, the only reason it was on the news i think was because of the reporters own curiousity /shrugs. And i think it served as filler as it wasnt a main focus point. I did see though several different reports of molten metal.</div></blockquote>

Well Pern, I once thought you were a pretty cool guy, but since you decided to play on people's emotions and perpetuate this thread based on lies, baseless comments and just general bullshit, I have to agree with Cellar.  Your credibility and my respect for you has gone where this thread is now: down the toilet.   Not that you give a shit.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

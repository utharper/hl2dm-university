	<div class="content">I dont know what makes you think you can be judge and jury over me but you dont know shit so lets get a few facts straight shall we?<br>
<br>
TKZ- Died because Kraze basically turned the forums into a porn site (probably illegal since there were minors in the clan). So I left because while I agree people have the right to patronize those sites if they choose, I also feel I have the right not to if I choose. The other clan members left because they didnt like the way I was treated over the issue and since I was basically paying for the server and Kraze was terminally AFK there wasnt much future there anyway.<br>
<br>
DOR - Several members and I killed it ON PURPOSE to get rid of MFA and New Guy. No one wanted to play with them on the server and every time they showed up which was basically all the time, the server emptied.<br>
<br>
Khaos - Main reason is that except on rare occasions, casual players dont get along with competitive players. I tried to do both, but the casual wanted me to get rid of the competitive and the competitive wanted me to get rid of the casual. One night, while I was away, the differences in the personalities came to a head and blew everything apart. I made mistakes, I fully admit that but you know what, Im human and sometimes shit happens even with the best of intentions.<br>
<br>
You call me power hungry. Did you know that at one time, Khaos had a TF2 division with 40 people in it and that I handed that whole side of the clan and the servers over to someone we trusted to run as he saw fit. Did you know that when I split TF2 out of Khaos, I paid for a server for them for a while to make sure they could get up on their feet and survive? Does a power hungry person do that? I dont think so.<br>
<br>
I also purposely went AFK in Synergy until I knew they would be ok without me. If I was power hungry I would not have done that either. BTW the reason you werent accepted into Synergy is because we had a 15 year old girl and a 12 year old girl in the clan and I felt that they should not be in a clan with someone that continually objectifies women and rants and raves as much as you do. That is pretty much all I ever see of your personality so I just didnt think it would work out given the group dynamic.<br>
<br>
Clans come and clans go. People go their own ways to suit thier own interests. Thats life. In any case its really none of your fucking business, and what happened with Khaos is really between me and the ex-members of Khaos.<br>
<br>
Also, in case you havent noticed, none of the admins at the U play DM anymore, in fact most of the people posting at the U dont play any more. I really dont give a shit what you think about my being there but its the same reason everyone still goes there, and Ill be there until WT closes it down because I feel an obligation to him and to the other admins.<br>
<br>
Have a nice life<br>
---------------------------------------<br>
Like i give a shit. You set it up so couldn't reply to your tome.<br>
So, You were never my friend. You whined and sought support as you ate through 4 different clans, with your obsessive need for power and incompetence.<br>
<br>
I don't give a shit.<br>
You aren't my friend and never were, so fuck off thank you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

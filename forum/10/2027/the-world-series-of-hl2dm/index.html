	<div class="content">This was briefly discussed in irc a bit back, but I am bringin it here to get approval from everyone else 1st.  It's gonna be a showdown between the top usa players vs the top canadian players on the best maps.

Team CAN: poor_billy, NutriGrain, 2QuicK, Toad, col.kurtz &amp; mertz?<br>
<br>
Sorry to anyone I forgot, I couldn't really think too much about this.  I just want everyone's opinions so we can start some polls going.  I also made a steam group to support this event.  I might need your help for this one to organize it all master nino!   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Anything over 100 isn't the same... until 200 is "playable" if you want to join a pub and have a good time. If you plan to compete even having 100 is a bit disadvantageous.<br>

if herbs wants to make i happen, a short 1 game with the top players from US/CAN would be best imo,  After having everything work.  And thus drawing in more interest, then try to expand it.

<br>
no you did say that to be a bitch, true statement or not doesn't hide the fact that you would be shooting unwanted children into socks if flas was able to do the same thing.<br>
<br>
-insert poorbilly dolphin cry here-<br>
<br>
you're just crying because even "not trying" you wouldn't beable to lose to sw by as much as they lost to ewr, and all "not trying" aside, sw was pretty confident adding seagull to the roster would be enough to take the win. sw was undefeated in cal, seagull took the 1v1 last season... shit helk even came back, and omg undefeatable roster was defeated.<br>
<br>
it was an epic battle, and an impressive win for ewr and your the only one who thinks differently so go sit in the corner by yourself and cry while obsessing over poorbilly and masturbating with your own tears as lube.<br>
<br>
and we all know how much you care about this game and how serious you take it conf:<br>

oh and also maybe SW wasn't at the top of their game during our caverns match, but that still doesn't mean that they weren't good.  If you want to go around saying that we only beat them because they weren't at the top of their game and other teams could beat them as well, you better have some screens to prove it, because so far i haven't seen a clan beat SW in awhile.  Please, icon or flaS, beat SW in a match or scrim...then you can say what you want.</div></blockquote>

lol nutri, me and you have good blood haha, it wasn't offensive at all... I didn't say canada would probably forfit, that was me quoting nino, and I just didn't want to cut the sentence off mid-way, I wanted to just put it in there to finish the sentence lol. I didn't say they had to suck for you guys to win either I actually meant that they just weren't at the prime of their game though :\... sure we're not the best team, I'll be the first to admit that... but these guys have been playing to learn. but hey, you do deserve a congrat's so here it is <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

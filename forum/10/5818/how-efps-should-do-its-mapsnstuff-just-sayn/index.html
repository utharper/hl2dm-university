	<div class="content">I realize its a small tournament in a relatively closed community and you want it simple so shit gets done. <br>
I understand that Da11aS, I do. Really, I do. K.I.S.S method. I get it, totally. <br>
That doesn't mean it can't be a lot better and a model for future possible league matches in another tournament or season. <br>
<br>
Allow me to write another "book" (as you fuckwads call them) of a hl2dm-forum post: <br>
<br>
It be Called: pick-map-pools, we had this (somewhat) in the CU::NA league.  <br>
You are probably rolling you eyes at this point, Dallas, but fucking read me out. <br>
The {code} implies I am doing some background info crap and you should skip if you can see you already know what I am explaining. <br>
Just saving you people time.<br>
<br>
Before match even enter's the team-manager's communicating bullcrap, there is a <strong class="text-strong">home</strong> team and an <strong class="text-strong">away</strong> team.<br>
The home team basically/automatically wins the "coin-toss" and get's first pick on specifying what aspect of competition they so choose. 
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Chances are most American readers will understand this NFL model, but for those who do not: 
The NFL Team who wins the coin-toss at the start of a game can choose to pick first possession of football (advantage momentum)
*or* that aforementioned Team can first choose to pick which Goal-Post to defend (advantage weather/environment)
*or* that aforementioned Team can defer said First-Choice (of environment/momentum) to the other team who "lost" the coin-toss. 
I think there is other crap NFL teams can do but I don't fucking care to say it, so eat me: Munch-Munch.</code></pre></div> <br>
The <strong class="text-strong">home</strong> team can pick "where" (from a pool of league-mandated &amp; administrated servers) the entire (both rounds) match is to be played. <br>
*or* that same <strong class="text-strong">home</strong> team can pick which round they wish to play their map (from a pool of league-mandated &amp; specified maps) choice. <br>
*or* that same <strong class="text-strong">home</strong> team can defer said First-Choice (of server/environment) to the <strong class="text-strong">away</strong> team. <br>
Once the <strong class="text-strong">home</strong> Team chooses one aspect, they leave other to the <strong class="text-strong">away</strong> Team; just like the NFL's junk.<br>
<br>
Two teams, each with one map pick :: one <em class="text-italics">HOME</em> round as well as one <em class="text-italics">AWAY</em> round. <br>
Even though footsteps are now balanced, a team on it's <em class="text-italics">HOME</em> map has to be combine (blue) with other team being rebels (red). <br>
Oh shut-up. I am just being thorough. <br>
<br>
Unlike CU, there should be a pool of maps limited to like 12-15 total for each division, and right now we only have a 2v2 pool to consider. <br>
Also unlike CU, there should be restrictions on map-picking to prevent whoring of such: <br>
Once a team uses a particular map for a <em class="text-italics">HOME</em> round in a match, they then cannot pick that same <em class="text-italics">HOME</em> map until 2-3 more matches have been played.<br>
I really hope it is 3 so that a Team will be forced to "whore" an utter minimum of 4 maps. <br>
Having to be combine is just what has been done in the past and makes info easier from a Screen-Shot perspective. <br>
<br>
Tie-Breakers are simple in this model (despite what Fearsome's limited mind may fathom and think otherwise) = Team with better score Picks 3rd map.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>.ewR| vs. $W 
[.ewR| won 187-17 over $W on dm_caverns] + [$W won 21-12 on dm_lockdown] = its a tie but .ewR| chooses the tie-breaking map. 
Why? Round score is Tied @ 1:1, but frag score is 199:38 in favor of .ewR| 
Frags tiebreak Rounds :: Smart and Simple.</code></pre></div>
Tie-Breaking Map picks as well as Time-Idle-Deferred Map picks are absolved of and Anti-Whoring Rule Restrictions. <br>
So .ewR| can, and probably will, pick Caverns for every round-tied match in this league. <br>
<br>
What are Time-Idle-Deferred (TID or "tiddy") Map picks? <br>
Tiddy's are quite simple. (you have them when you're Seagull LOLOLOLOLOLOL) <br>
A TID map pick is a response to Teams being Idle in the Communication or Managing process of a Match. <br>
Teams going afk in a League is a common piece of shit, and they should be penalized for it. <br>
So matches will be given a week to be played, right? So all the particulars need to be worked out 4 days prior. <br>
If not, the active team picks everything with no restrictions. <br>
<br>
We are all men here so we should NOT have any Tiddy's.  <br>
For-Fucks-Sake, amirite? <br>
<br>
There was other shit I wanted to specify, but I got busy, so I'll just let all you little nigglets Punch holes in this as it is. <br>
<br>
Then'll either annihilate or amalgamate your Point(s).   <br>

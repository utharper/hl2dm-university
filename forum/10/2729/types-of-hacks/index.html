	<div class="content">Hopefully i'm not breaking any rules here but I wondered if someone can tell me what types of hacks are out there for HL2DM? The reason I ask is that I help run clan TKC which has 3 DM servers and 1 CTF server. They are rather popular so we have several admins. I'm afraid some of my admins aren't sure what is a hack and what isn't and I keep dealing with users being banned for hacking and I don't really think they are hacking. I don't ask for links or anything like that, just TYPES of hacks. Some are obvious, aimbots, speedhacks, but is there anything, for instance, that allows teleport or moving thru walls (not seeing thru walls which is a wall hack)? Thanks for any assistance. If this breaks any rules feel free to delete the post.<br>

Sorry I cant help much, I have only heard of or seen people using common aimbots/wallhacks/esp/speedhacks.<br>
<br>
My approach would be to ask all your admins to provide demo proof if they are actually perma-banning for hacking. It would suck to be getting rid of legit players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception. Often this works in conjunction with wallhacks, but examples might include the hack telling you what weapon they have out, how much ammo they have, how much health and armor they have. Things you wouldnt normally know. <br>
<br>
It may also highlight pickups so you can go grab them as soon as they spawn.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I am not aware of any case where people can teleport. Or give themself unlimited health. Those are the 2 most stupid accuations I see. <br>
Hax can usually be classified as follows.<br>
ESPs which you have discussed. <br>
Wall hax which vary in look and distance but all have in common that some how you know where people are that you cannot see. The most primitive ones simply reverse the render order of the scene so you see things that you should not first. Otheres only draw the models like r_drawothermodels 2 but not in wire frame. And most advanced ones just mark the player usually with a icon and ESP info. <br>
Aim bots. which can be programmed thousands of ways to hit different areas. <br>
Aim botting can be separated into auto aim, which moves the mouse for you, and auto shoot which shoots when the crosshair goes over a player. Then the combination of the 2  which is the most commonly thought of variant. <br>
For probably 6-8 years nearly every decent hack has the ability to do everyone one of these and configure them any way the player wants to.<br>
<br>
From my experience the vast majority (90% anecdotally) of cheat accusations are false and a high number of those are outright stupid. And the people who are cheating often surprise you and many times are not even very good players (even with the cheats saddly for them) and no one is even accusing them. One of the biggest problems is that computers have so many client side variables that players look at the game through their own senses and do not understand how someone could do something but fail to realize the other person sees, feels, and hears the game in a very different way. Many people even have hardware reasons they simply cannot do what another player can do and the same for configuration. So the best thing to do is get your guys to openly discuss the issues and get some feed back from the players here. You can even post a demo in the demos section and get explainations. <br>
<br>
The best thing to do if you think you have a hacker is to bring it the attention of U board members then you can get an outside opinion from players who have seen the best of the best and know what is possible and also it will let them all ban the player if he really is judged to be hacking. <br>
<br>
Also realize that a catch in this manner is never 100% certain, and if the person is let go it never means 100% they did not hack. It simply means that the evidence is not sufficient or there exists some reasonable doubt.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

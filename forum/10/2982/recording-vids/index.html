<br>
so i would just type tv_record in console?  do i have to log onto rcon first?  so would it be rcon tv_record ?  does anything need to be set up on the server side?  i obviously have source tv set up but is there any commands that need to go into the cfg file to "prep it" so its listening for this command to be run?<br>

Everyone at the begining of the match record a demo, you collect them all, export them using the in game functions and use premier to sync sort and edit in any way you see fit. The only problem I ran into was when changing camera views using the in game tools to a free floating camera. Your grav gun or any little animations that are going on with your character are still in front of you on screen no matter where you are in relation. Also I exported all of my demo's at 60FPS so when I wanted slow motion I would have twice the frames per second. Although most people don't have hundreds of gigs free to work with.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

ahhhh, i see what you are saying now.  im sure that can be done because in order to be able to see all POV's the coding from all the players I/O streams have to be in that file.  you would need a program that can strip those.  i would talk to odog. he is going to school for vid editing, he may be able to help you and/or point you in the right direction</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i maybe be misunderstanding still.  from the source demo, just use the spacebar to change the pov and the mouse1 to change players.  record your movie from whichever player(s) tick that interests you.<br>
<br>
from your movie editing perspective... it will just be your creative choice.  you could do a screen in screen or split screen or show the frag in real time from one perspective and slo-mo from the others perspective.<br>

i don't think that can be done val.  if im understanding you, you essentially want the sourcetv dem as an avi?  a vid that you can just hit a button and change players?  or do you mean like a free camera birdseye view of all playing... then zoom in to the interesting battles?<br>
<br>
otherwise, i think what o-dog suggested is the only way.  record out each player and go with with a four-way split... then zoom to one of the four splits and back out as the action dictates.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

no.<br>
i want to convert the dem from the sourceTV to four (4) vids (have AVI or whatever).<br>
then open these 4 vids in Vegas.<br>
Vegas has channels so i can see all 4 vids in it and edit them the way i like.<br>

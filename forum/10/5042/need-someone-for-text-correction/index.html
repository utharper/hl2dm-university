	<div class="content">I might consider aiding you.<br>
<br>
I'm top of my class in an English AP (that's Advanced Placement, an internationally recognized program) course, graduating high school this June having achieved "honors with distinction"<br>
<br>
Roughly how much workload are you expecting to be rolling through for your proofreader, and with what kind of deadline?  Depending on these, I would possibly do it for a very reasonable cost; or potentially not at all, as I need to get a job soon.<br>
<br>
If it makes a difference to you, I've been accepted into engineering at a prestigious university, one having been "officially" rated the 3rd best engineering school in North America.<br>
<br>
Send me a PM with more information, including what kind of website you're running, and I will try and get back to you ASAP with an answer.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

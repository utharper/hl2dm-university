As far as Im concerned anyone who feels the need to hack in any game at all, is the type of person who would also hack in any other game they play. I understand that this guy is your friend but the fact that you didn't even know he had a account that was VAC'd, just goes to show that you probably wouldn't know for sure if he had or hadn't hacked in hl2dm. <br>
Regardless if he has or not I think anyone who has had a VAC'd account deserves to be blacklisted by the community and should not be allowed to compete in organized leagues like CAL, Warzone ect. Basicly once a cheater always a cheater, and that has been proved time and time again.<br>
<br>
And BTW the steam VAC forums are full of guys who are making dime a dozen excuses like he has when their account gets VAC'd.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">so slick fro gets VAC banned, but don't worry, he doesn't hack.<br>
<br>
meanwhile, CAL decides that I'm not hacking, I haven't been banned by anything (except the KaT clan server lol), and yet somehow, I still hack?  <br>
<br>
Is this correct teto?<br>
<br>
There was a whole group of CAL admins (not to mention the handful of regulars) reviewing my demos, and they came to the conclusion that I don't hack.  Yet you still keep saying I do.  Maybe it's more of an excuse now than a belief?  If you're gonna use an excuse not to scrim me/ewR/EE then pick one that isn't as lame...like, new sens <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
I'm not the one that needs the grow up pep talk here...<br>
<br>
oh by the way...I don't believe that Slick Fr0 hacks in HL2DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Why does everyone keep saying this? First of all, Fearsome never officially released r4. He gave the download to a few people and asked for feedback. A lot of people mentioned that some common xbow shots were not working anymore. In fact, most of them were not working, so that was one of the things he fixed going to r5.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Who am I to say that? Well Id have to say I'm one who prefers to see the game prosper and continue to have more competition. I am one who says that when good teams dissolve and then the members go and join the dominate team they are hurting the game overall by lessening the amount of teams that compete. If you guys really had some balls you would have gave it another shot, rather than just joining the team you couldn't defeat in CAL. Scrims don't mean much, its the league that counts.<br>
I also find it kind of sad that the game manager someone who is supposed to have the leagues best interests in mind, would condone the merging of teams like this. I mean seriously whats the ultimate goal here; to have a league ran by SW and only competed in by SW on maps that only SW approves of?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

flas didnt merge with sw, after i quti for a month flas dissolved. book joined 911, tiggy joined vdus, confused joined sw, phantom went to WoW/tf2, and rachkir went to l4d. gas mask was thinking of starting a flas 2 last i spoke with him. if you think i joined sw because i couldnt beat them in cal and therefore just wanted to be on the winning team you are terribly mistaken. also the league isn't ran by sw the league is ran by multiple admins, only ONE of whom is in sw. the maps that are in it are a combination of standbys that YOU THE PLAYER voted for, maps that are making their first appearance, and a few admin selected maps. what do you not get about this? if fearsome wanted to make cal biased towards sw he would put some random weird map as the playoff map or finals map that sw would know well and maybe even have designed (omfg this sounds like WARZONE!1) therefore his team would have the advantage. he hasn't put in a new map for finals in each season i've played, therefore keeping the playing field level. again, you want more competition? are you on a cal 2v2 or 4v4 team? if so great, maybe you could help teach some newer teams? scrim them a bunch? thats my current plan, but what do i know? im the one who selfishly wants the league to only be revolving around sw, and who only wants to be on the winning team.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok. I've been keeping myself out of this since the beginning, but I think it's going too far. I've always seen you as a cool dude punk, I used to be in aXon with you, and I've never seen you being any kind of "bad" person. idk what's up with you, but if you think that me or Zman joined SW because we couldn't beat them, you should think a little before speaking, we beat them plenty of times in scrims, as well as they beat us plenty of times, the first season flaS played cal, we came damn close to taking 1st in cal 4v4, don't really remember 2v2, but it was really close for 4v4, and it was our first season. I joined SW because of personal reasons that I don't want to mention here, but will gladly tell you on steam anytime you ask, and not any of them is because I wanted to win cal, because I know that ewR is a very strong team even if I don't really get along with them that well, and that they have a good chance of beating us. So don't come saying bullshit when you don't have anything to back it up, and can't even prove to me or anyone that what your saying is true.<br>

Well Khaos has been coming close or soundly defeating some of the big names lately. I expect them to be a new contender, so that makes 4 teams in contention for the crown, sdub, ewr, 911 and khaos. Still for a person like me sitting on the sidelines who do you root for, the loudmouths, the boring old guard, the team that can never quite win the big match or the ewR verson 1.0001(sorry Khaos I like some of you guys but your style is alot like pb's and nutri's <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">).

Exactly. Khaos is the perfect example of hard work and determination. Instead of thinking about how your team can't CURRENTLY beat the top teams, work with your team knowing that it is possible to get better and eventually be the team that you want to be. Kudos to Khaos for putting up with everyone's remarks and I hope they win CAL this season.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

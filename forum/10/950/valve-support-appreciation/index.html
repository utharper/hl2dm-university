put in a support ticket today (for a password recovery) and they not only responded to it, but solved the problem in less than an hour!  and this was at like 6PM!<br>
<br>
I know we bitch about the lack of bugfixes and whatnot for HL2DM and yes, sometimes Valve does do things that don't make sense (*cough*orangeboxengine*cough*), but I have absolutely no complaints about their general technical support at all, it has been right on point in my experience so far.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've never dealt with them. I know their chat bugs really suck. Good thing we had Keeper to make a plugin back when I was in GoTg to fix chat.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

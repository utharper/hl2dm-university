The whole review vid was actually about 12 mins, so I cut it in half and rendered out half of it for this week, make sure to sub to my channel to be notified for the 2nd part which goes over some of the problems I have with the headset. Enjoy, rate thumbs up and leave lots of comments plz. <br>

	<div class="content">Nice job with the review. Pretty nifty headset. I have a question though and this may be a negative which you might bring up in part 2, but if you have to plug the amp into the soundcard how do you go about pluging in regular 5.1 speakers if you have those as well? Do you have to plug and unplug everytime you are using the headphones? I use headphones about as equal as my regular speakers so that could perhaps become a major pain in my ass if that is the case. And considering these are 5.1, it looked like it was 3 hook ups compared to the usual 1 for most headphones and that would hinder my logitech 5500 headphone port worthless.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Bypass plugs are available, its like a Y, whereas you can plug the Y in and have two outputs from one female on the sound card. I have never personally tried this method but I hear it works.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Wow thanks man, that means a lot. I'll be uploading the 2nd Part tonight or tomorrow morning I made some adjustments on it to make it a bit more in depth. I'm trying to make visually pleasing reviews as well as informative and brutally honest reviews. There have been a lot of reviews on this headset since it came out last year a few of them were pretty good, but a few of them didn't go into detail about the headset. Anyone who is or might drop $300 bucks deserves to know what they are getting into for that kind of money. I felt like most reviews were just half done because they review stuff all the time or totally biased. So I got the money for it from my other youtube channel, tested the crap outa the headset to see for myself. <br>
<br>
It's funny cuz, after I came out with an unboxing vid (the first one on youtube), like 3 other people did as well and they got several thousands hits haha.<br>
<br>
Thanks guys for the views and feedback, you have no idea how much that helps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

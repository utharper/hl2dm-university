	<div class="content">Got this in an email.  Not being one to believe everything I read,  I wonder if someone who lives in the where this story happened can corroborate the facts.  In any case it brings up some interesting thoughts regarding the gun control debate that rages in the U.S.<br>
<br>
You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your bedroom door.  Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled whispers. <br>
At least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way. With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun. <br>
You rack a shell into the chamber, then inch toward the door and open it. <br>
 <br>
In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds something that looks like a crowbar. When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.  One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside. <br>
 <br>
As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless.  Yours was never registered.  Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died. They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal Possession of a Firearm.  When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry: authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter. <br>
 <br>
"What kind of sentence will I get?" you ask. <br>
"Only ten-to-twelve years,"  he replies, as if that's nothing.  "Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven." <br>
 <br>
The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choirboys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say about them.  Buried deep down in the article, authorities acknowledge that both "victims" have been arrested numerous times.  But the next day's headline says it all: "Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die."  The thieves have been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type pranksters.   As the days wear on, the story takes wings.  The national media picks it up, then the international media.  The surviving burglar has become a folk hero.  Your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.  The media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you've been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects.  After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time.  The District Attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars. <br>
 <br>
 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted.  When you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works against you.   Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean, vengeful man.   It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges. <br>
<br>
The judge sentences you to life in prison. <br>
<br>
This case really happened.   On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk , England , killed one burglar and wounded a second.   In April, 2000, he was convicted and is now serving a life term.  How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the once great British Empire ? <br>
<br>
It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.  Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns.  Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw.  When the smoke cleared, 17 people were dead.   <br>
<br>
The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of "gun control", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan used a rifle.)  Nine years later, at Dunblane , Scotland , Thomas Hamilton used a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school.   <br>
<br>
For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day, week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns. The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens.<br>
<br>
During the years in which the British government incrementally took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened, claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released.  Indeed, after the Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, "We cannot have people take the law into their own hands."  All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars.  When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.  Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year prison sentences if they didn't comply.  Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns from private citizens.  How did the authorities know who had handguns?  The guns had been registered and licensed.<br>
Kind of like cars. Sound familiar?<br>
<br>
THIS IS WHY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN OUR U.S. CONSTITUTION.<br>
<br>
"..It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people's minds.."  --Samuel Adams<br>
<br>
<br>
Apparently, President Obama is planning to do similar leegislation in the U.S.?  I havent heard of anything specific on the news myself, has anyone else?  I do believe in our constitutional right to bear arms and its interesting to think that criminals could be emboldened by this type of strict legislation and that the concept of armed citizens could be a possible deterrant.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If police and military didn't have them, then I would say there is no need for them, but that will never be.  Only if they were never invented would that ever be.  Citizens need to be able to defend themselves against a tyranical government; it's unfortunate that there are so many petty crimes committed, and so many that have died from their use in domestic crimes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
But the bad guys are going to get guns either way, all they are doing is fucking the legit ppl in the ass. Gun laws in Australia are really strict nowa days after there was a killing spree in Tasmania, but that guy didnt obtain his weapons legally, and had anyone else been carrying a gun obviously he would not have got very far (citizens cannot carry weapons, not even b4 the new gun laws). Once again, the legit get fucked in the ass. Politicians used the situation for their own popularity contests rather then actually being concerned about crime rates, i would like to see more availablility with super tight regulations rather then just making them illegal for the most part.<br>
<br>
Texas is a good example yea?<br>

<br>
Also, if you get robbed numerous times, it gets expensive having to replace stuff over again and Im sure the insurance company is probably going to stop allowing the claims after a while.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i see this as a two-fold issue.  2nd amendment, right to bear arms... and 4th amendment, right against unreasonable searches and seizures.<br>
<br>
ever heard the phrase, a mans home is his castle?  its old english common law... apparently forgotten in britain.  it illustrates the principle of individual privacy and is still fundamental to the american system of government.<br>
<br>
regardless of what you see on tv, its not that easy to get a search warrant for a persons home.  the police have to swear an oath or file an affadavit before a judge to establish probable cause.  many states still require special circumstances before allowing a "no knock" search warrant.  did you catch that?  typical search warrants require KNOCKING ON THE DOOR BEFORE ENTERING!  many states also require search warrants to be served during daylight hours, again, unless special circumstances exist.  search warrants also come with time restrictions, typically they must be served within 72 hrs... or the po-po has to go back and get another search warrant through the same process.  the 4th amendment is an extremely powerful right!<br>
<br>
yes, badinfluence, a homeowner could take that route.  let someone take your shit, watch your rates increase, or get cancelled altogether.  keep in mind the clearance rate (solved) for burglaries in the U.S. is about 10%.  most burglaries occur during daylight hours and there are no witnesses and very little evidence.  the motivation for breaking into an occupied home is superficially plausable at best.  its a home invasion and imho, its best to assume the worst for your/family safety.<br>
<br>
theres another 911 tape floating around the internets from a few weeks ago.  a woman in oklahoma shot a man with a shotgun after he broke into her home.  its very compelling audio, you hear her anguish about what happened.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Because ever robber should be able to feel secure whilst robbing someone, its just common sense. <br>
I mean, we really shouldn't discourage such hard-earned robbing, for that is like taking jobs away from our economy; just like when US labor unions drive auto-makers to go to Mexico where the labor costs 1/10th of what it does here.<br>
<br>
People breaking the law should should know their government will protect them from those horrible law-abiding citizens. <br>
I mean, if the US allows law-aiders to shoot our beloved robbers and thieves, it will drive them out and send them to the robber-friendly UK.<br>

	<div class="content">My personal opinion on the matter even if someone is on your property does not give you the right to take a persons life even if they broke in and scared the living shit out of you and is what would be described as a low life. If having a gun is for self defence certainly why shot a unarmed man and kill him certainly a plastic replica gun would be enough to scare the guy off or get him surrender. If you take a life you pay the penalty end of and in this country if you have a weapon and events occur where someone loses their life in the eyes of the law you had intent to take a life and so pay the penalty. <br>
<br>
Also what with giving guns reduce crime as a fact and when has ever Texas been a template of how the rest of the world works. As lead said in a place like Glasgow or London legalising guns make things worst and actually gun crime has lowered beacause so little amount of guns around that criminals have to rent guns from their dealer. <br>
<br>
All I can say is that im glad I don't live in a place where guns are excepted and prefer people to use other means to protecting them selfs than for some messed up kid to get hold of his parents gun and go on a killing spree in a shopping center. But rest sure if someone brakes into my property im not going to make them a cup of tea more or less going to beat the crap out of them until the police turn up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What is one supposed to do, find out if they are armed?!!??!?<br>
I think, if they don't want shit, they don't bring shit.<br>
Your house is your property and you have the right to defend it.<br>
ODumba can try all he likes, he is never making America into a Euro-Trash Socialist nanny state.<br>
<br>
Criminals don't obey the law, so who is it that is effected by Gun Laws?!?<br>
<br>
Lets not look to Britain (ENGLAND). Britain is in serious decline. They don't give a crap anymore. Shame, when one considers its Great Empire.<br>
<br>
Gun Laws in America would go far as to make millions of good citizens into criminals, cause they aren't giving up their arms.<br>
Gun Laws do not make criminals become law abiding citizens.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It simply does not matter. Guns or no guns there is no significant evidence that either way is safer overall. Everyone on both sides likes to tell very touching stories to support their points but in a sense neither is right or wrong and stories are meaningless anyone anywhere can come up with a story to support their claim, which might be true or a lie. Switzerland is a country where guns used to be MANDATORY pretty much everyone had to have one because everyone had to be in the army. They have a very low crime rate. England is the opposite no guns allowed and also a low crime rate, both are developed nations. The US has guns but has a higher crime rate but nothing as bad as Brazil which does not allow guns. The fact is the things that effect crime rate really have nothing to do with guns, they have to do with how dense the population is and poverty. That is all if you want to solve the problem mainly you must solve poverty.<br>
<br>
If you start to think about it you can go in circles with every argument. <br>
<br>
Add guns, some criminals are scared to rob people or murder because they being cowards may actually confront someone with weapons. But then other criminals become worse because they know that other people have guns so when they rob they shoot first check for a gun later. If people have guns they can take down postal people, but then cops cannot arrest people who have guns. People with guns can run off and do something stupid fast like kill their cheating wife, then again what stops you from hacking her with a knife, pencil or your bare hands. The problem I am illustrating is that humans are far to intelligent to just sit there and not adapt, what ever the rules are guns or no guns some people will figure out a way around it, or better yet use the rule to their advantage. Like all things of great power it is all about the person using the power. The one nice thing about guns is they are an equalizer it does not matter how strong you are if you are willing to pull trigger it is the same with nuclear weapons a small country can now defend itself against anyone because few are willing to risk taking a hit from a gun or a nuclear weapon. The threat of mutual destruction ensures peace they say. <br>
<br>
I really don't care most of the time because in reality if you live in a nice area you probably wont bother to have a gun anyway. If you live in a bad area you might pick one up even if you are law abiding citizen and it is not allowed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This ^^  In academia and philosophy one begins to learn for every arguement there is usually a valid counterarguement. However one must take a stand in what one believes in. After doing some pretty intensive research myself for a paper where I was forced to be pro-gun, both within the United States from state to state and GLOBALLY there exists a vast contradiction in whether lax gun laws decrease crime or increase it, simply from state to state within the US or with international countries the factual statistics are perplexing and result in no ability to factually state in a general statement that GUNS DECREASE CRIME, OR GUNS INCREASE CRIME. Fearsome is correct in correlating poverty with gun crime, this is a factual trend throughout the world, and has been for decades, long enough to say it is a fact poverty correlates to gun crime, no matter the country or state. <br>
<br>
All that said my stand is the right to bear arms must be maintained to prevent tyranny of the government, directly implied in the U.S. Constitution to a point of irrefutable strict judicial review, beyond the power of president or the Court's jurisdiction to completely abolish and I too will stand by it. Grey areas of what types of firearms, the transportation of firearms beyond country and state lines and the requirements of purchasing a firearms however are not cut and dry for me, nor should they be with anyone.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

People with guns can run off and do something stupid fast like kill their cheating wife, then again what stops you from hacking her with a knife, pencil or your bare hands. The problem I am illustrating is that humans are far to intelligent to just sit there and not adapt, what ever the rules are guns or no guns some people will figure out a way around it, or better yet use the rule to their advantage. Like all things of great power it is all about the person using the power. The one nice thing about guns is they are an equalizer it does not matter how strong you are if you are willing to pull trigger it is the same with nuclear weapons a small country can now defend itself against anyone because few are willing to risk taking a hit from a gun or a nuclear weapon. The threat of mutual destruction ensures peace they say. <br>
<br>
I really don't care most of the time because in reality if you live in a nice area you probably wont bother to have a gun anyway. If you live in a bad area you might pick one up even if you are law abiding citizen and it is not allowed.</div></blockquote>

I'm not sure the US really voted him in either time lol. Gore had more votes and that entire election is a wash. That being said, I voted for Bush the first time around. When you are basically stuck with voting for 1 of 2 people, I try to choose the lesser of 2 evils. Gore and Kerry were both, and are still both, just as retarded as Bush. McCain is probably worse then all 3. I really dont think the American people have made any mistakes other then allowing their elected officials to get away with so much crap for so long.

britain lost its common law, sweden lost its common sense.<br>
<br>
try this on:<br>
<br>
a man knocks on your door at bedtime stating he needs help.  as you open the door, he forces his way in at gunpoint.  he has an accomplice.  they round up your 4 other friends make you all strip naked.<br>
<br>
they ask for your money.  you all cooperate.  offer up every bit of spare change you have, jewelery, anything of value.<br>
<br>
your female friends are forced to perform oral sex with each other.  the males are then forced to have intercourse with the females.  when you fail to get an erection, you are beaten with a golf club.<br>
<br>
one burglar leaves with a victim to get money from an atm.  the other remains and rapes your female friend.  each victim in turn, being driven to drain their atm account.  each female in turn raped, repeatedly as the night continued.  all victims continuing to cooperate, hoping their lives would be spared.<br>
<br>
eventually, you and your friends are crammed into the trunk of a car, still naked.  you are driven to a snow covered soccer field, released from the trunk, and ordered to kneel in the snow.<br>
<br>
one by one, you and your friends are shot in the back of the head.  left lying naked on the snow, bleeding, dying.  then, for good measure, the burglars run over your bodies with a truck.<br>
<br>
miraculously, one of your friends survives.  after the burglars drive away, she checks on her friends.  she can do little to help them.  so she runs a mile in the frigid cold, naked, bleeding, dodging any vehicles out of fear that it may be the burglars again.<br>
<br>
until finally, she finds a house and knocks on the door, and get s the help she needs.<br>
<br>
meanwhile, the burglars return to your house to steal some more shit... and stab your dog to death.<br>

<br>
Thing is since there not much guns around where I am their is no need for me or my family owning a gun because simply the likely hood of any of us to coming across someone one with a gun is pretty slim.<br>
<br>
But yes I do agree I should have the right to protect my property and my self and yea the law here is a bit F up in this regard since police expect you not to do nothing while someone on your property stealing shit. But that's k nothing is stopping me from clobbering the guy with a bat and might as well deal with the consequences latter but I don't need a gun to protect my property.<br>

possible.  just as possible it could have made difference in the outcome.<br>
<br>
in this case, one bad guy repeatedly left the house with one of the victims to drain their atm, leaving one bad guy in the house with 3 males and 1 female, or 2 males and 2 females.  while he was raping the female, the others were SHUT in a closet in another room.  not LOCKED in a closet.  SHUT, and unsupervised.  they were being cooperative and didnt even try to escape.  IF there was a gun in that room, it could have made a difference.<br>
<br>
the lone survivor talked about how easily she could have reached the bad guys gun while he was raping her.  but she was resigned to submit to any humility and degradation to survive.  she said she was AFRAID to grab the gun because she was unfamiliar with guns.  she was more AFRAID of a handgun, than the man raping her.<br>
<br>

If I look at Sweden I can't really come up with any burglary that have ended up in a murderer. People can't get guns really. A hunting rifle at the most. those who have guns arn't a simple burglar you need to go deeper down in the shit than that if you need guns. Therefore a normal person don't have to fear taht there's a burglar coming in with a gun. I'd rather say that a normal person don't even have to be afraid of a burglar at all. Maybe when you're on vacation but not when you're home. Really I'm not the one to say if you guys should ahve a gun or not. I dunno how safe you feel in your country. All I would know is that I would feel less safe if everyone had a gun than now when no one has one. <br>
<br>
I just think about the small kids that find their dad's gun and then shoot people at their schools. <br>
<br>
this wouldn't stop me to knock him out with a bat as SND said if I was able to or even shoot him in the leg if i had a gun. What my sarcastic statement came form was the simple fact that for you it doesn't matter if you kill someone or not. Just fucking shoot em. Without hesitation. I'm pretty sure the normal burglar don't come to kill you. But what do I know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Having a gun is not enough.  Training with it enough so that the movements are instinctual and can be performed under high stress is just as important.  So is situational awareness.   Opening the door to two strange men is just not smart these days, but I understand why someone would do it in a reasonably safe neighborhood.  When I look at the US economy, I see many things that are unsustainable.  I see hard times ahead and social unrest that could range from moderate to severe depending on how things play out.  I think this will start to become obvious by the end of 2010.  The US govt has $2 trillion in debt to rollover this year, plus new deficits.  It seems unlikely that foreigners will continue to service our debt at the levels seen in recent years.  What will likely happen is that the Fed will monetize the debt, leading to higher inflation, and higher interest rates.  Once interest rates rise, the financial system will implode, and I don't think implode is too strong a word.  If there was ever a time to review your home security system, including owning firearms, it's now.   It may not save you, but it might.

if you're defending yourself/others in your own home, it becomes justifiable homocide if you kill the person.  same as with a gun.<br>

	<div class="content">I didn't understand the idea of just letting people take your shit so your insurance can just pay you back for it.  Anyone who thinks that is what happens is fucking ignorant.  If you're broken into the only outcome that you win in is really if you stop them and then not get convicted for it.<br>
<br>
At our house, our insurance company depreciates the value of our property.  So, if we get shit stolen we lose money, cause we don't get what we paid for it in the first place AND our insurance rate goes up!  THEN, if we were to get broken into over &amp; over again and keep putting claims in, our insurance company can cancel our insurance for being too high of a risk to insure!<br>
<br>
You can pay a higher rate for insurance that repays you 100% value of stolen property, but that's just it, it's mooooore expensive!  People are having a hard enough time right now just being able to afford insurance, so they definitely aren't gonna be able to afford the best coverage.  A gun + a box or 2 of ammo is a cheap, one-time-payment type of VERY dependable insurance.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that someone breaking into the house is a threat to your life with or without a gun cause they could just as easily make a weapon outta something laying around your house.  The impossibility of knowing someone's true intentions and inhibitions is good enough cause for me to feel that my life is threatened, especially if it's night time.<br>
<br>
You can rest assured, I WILL have a gun whether or not the law allows it here, nor will I be uneducated on its use or afraid to use it when necessary.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">guns are fucking awesome. they're real dangerous tools in too many wrong hands these days. but i grew up with a gun in my house, my dad had shotguns and a pistol. he had a gun safe and the bullets/shells locked up. i've been deer hunting, skeet shooting and have only once been to a real indoor range and a few outdoor ranges. the shit is fucking fun. i don't care you can't talk shit until you pull the trigger on one. i kinda think the simpsons writers nailed it with the sense of overinflated ego stroking. but firing off a few rounds at a paper target, moving target and live game is a thrill i almost try to replicate in the comfort of my home in a video game fps. <br>
<br>
i don't know about your average civy owning automatic weapons though, but hey shotguns and pistols for use of home protection are ok with me. i was actually looking at NJ NRA, the dues are a bit much so i think i'll get a permit for a pistol, they fuck you in NJ for the dual application of long gun/pistol license. but shit jersey just made medical mj ok so i'm laughing pretty hard at our governments dualities right now.<br>
<br>
i'm looking at a glock 19 or sig sauer or a usp. any thoughts opinions out there? i'm looking for something easy to field strip and clean like the glock.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Do you include Prime 3 in the fun category? I do, loved that shit.</div></blockquote> <br>
Of course. <br>
That game made the prime trilogy worthwhile, and this chick who fancies herself my girlfriend got me the trilogy game-set thing. <br>
I didn't tell her I already had all three, but the wiimakes are fucking good; they even added bloom lighting to the first two and made the third prime have full-on HDR lighting. <br>
Load times are a bit longer in the third one now though, but it is worth it.  <br>
<br>
The fact that Retro Studios can make a game look that good with last-gen hardware means they should get a fucking medal.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and to everyone else : this is now a Metriod Thread, either get with it or GTFO. <br>
<br>
No one would even use a gun if we all had powered armorsuits...........................and boobs. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: I am pretty sure she got it when it was on sale at best buy for 20$; it is worth it at that price but not at 50$ which is what I have seen it at as of late. <br>
If you haven't played Prime 2, don't :: p1 and p3 are fucking awesome though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Let's just call it Metroid 3, but you are absolutely right. <br>
With modern rendering abilities, imagine how fucking scary the wrecked ship could be, or how fucking immersive Brinstarr could be. <br>

I get so hard just thinking about it. Not big or anything. Just hard. Yah.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Games emulating that style are commonly referred to as "metroidvanias".<br>
<br>
And ya, an hd remake of super metroid (or castlevania sotn, or preferably both) would be the bomb.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

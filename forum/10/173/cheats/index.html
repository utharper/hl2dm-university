	<div class="content">The sad thing about that video is it didn't seem to help the player any.  The no recoil was probably nice.  The rapid fire 9mm was nice.  But what about the ar2 and the mag?<br>
<br>
As far as the cheats telling you where people are, that's kind of pointless since anybody with sound can tell when somebody's coming.  If any of those players had advanced movement skills, that video would have shown how useless the cheat was.<br>
<br>
And what kind of loser would buy a cheat to play dm?  Of course, I play for fun only.  But you wouldn't be able to use them in competitions.  I guess I just don't understand the cheating/exploiting mentality.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sorry guys, I hate to censor stuff, but I had to remove it because the video advertises the site where the hack can be obtained.<br>
<br>
Even though this is fairly well known in the community, I do not want this site to get a reputation for openly disclosing or distributing hacks or information that directs players to them.<br>
<br>
I will also update our advertising policy to reflect the fact that any links to hack sites or or to sites promoting hack sites will be removed.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

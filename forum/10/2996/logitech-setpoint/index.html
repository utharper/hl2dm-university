	<div class="content">What a piece of crap.  I only installed it to check my mouse settings and change a few things on the onboard memory but to get it to work I had to "associate" it with the OS and doing so resets all onboard memory to factory defaults, luckily I had backups of all my profiles and such so it was easy to restore but OMG what a piece of garbage software this is.  I have never had to install it since the first time i used it to set up my mouse back in November 2007.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i have a G9. its awesome. had it for over a year now. before that i had the Mx518. both are great and really the G9 is proly the best mouse i've seen to date.<br>
Recently, the mouse started "freezing" randomly. out of nowhere the leds on it would disapear and the mouse is completely frozen. no updates or anything new on the system. just like that on its own.<br>
At first i thought it was indeed a mouse problem and went ahead and installed updates from anywhere starting from Windows to motherboard to Logitech but the problem is still there.<br>
Then, i went and hooked up a different USB mouse. a MS mouse. same problem. hmm.<br>
Removed this SetPoint thingie today after reading this thread and still no joy. i think someit is messed up in the USB 2.0 dept. at a brick wall.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Could always try a cheap add in usb 2.0 PCI card (then plug into that) and see if that helps, they usually run around 10.00 usd</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I found when I used setpoint implementation it kept changing somehow, its hard to explain but it kept messing my sens up big time.  Then theres the fact that if you take your mouse to a different computer you can easuily set up the OS to eb the same without installign anything.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you use a G9 and setpoint 5.1 Logitech have released a patch to fix the DPI switching to default when you reboot or log off.<br>
Iif you do not use a G9 then this does not apply also if you use a G9 but using setpoint 5.0 then this does not apply either.<br>

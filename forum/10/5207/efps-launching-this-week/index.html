	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">During this coming week, <em class="text-italics"><a href="http://www.everythingfps.com" class="postlink">www.everythingfps.com</a></em> will become live. </span></strong><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">What Will the Site Have at Launch?</span><br>
<br>
The site will launch with skins, maps, and news for hl2dm, CSS, TF2, L4D, L4D2, COD4, COD:MW2, BC2, and Portal. <br>
<br>
Over the last few months, I've been scouring the internet for the very best maps and skins for hl2dm, CSS, TF2, Portal, COD4, and L4D2. When I've found a particularly unique or high-quality skin or map, I've downloaded that file. Then, I put it into a ZIP file with the highest compression method for easy download. These ZIP files are uniform - they all have the same folder structure. This enables users to quickly unpack multiple archives at once without getting confused about what goes where. <br>
<br>
Similarly, all the ZIP files for skins have uniform installation instructions because all the ZIP files have the same internal folder structure. This lets users create their own custom combination of skins easily and quickly. Plus, there's no hassle about trying to figure out how to install different skins made by different authors. <br>
<br>
All the maps and skins will be presented with uniform-size, large screenshots, most of which I took myself. These screenshots are high-quality and enable users to quickly see if they like a skin or map enough to download and install it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">What Makes This Site Better Than Others?</span><br>
<br>
I'm proud to say that we will be presenting the most complete and high-quality site on the internet for half-life 2/hl2dm skins. I have pulled the best skins for hl2dm, 312 in total, from numerous sites. These skins are organized in detail by type, so finding what you want is simple. <br>
<br>
Similarly, we will have 64 hl2dm maps at launch. Though some maps are old and some are new, they share one thing in common - they are incredibly fun to play and are high quality. Pub maps and league maps are given equal space. <br>
<br>
For other games, we will have all of the best and most popular maps and skins for hl2, L4D, L4D2, TF2, and CSS, Poral, and COD4. This translates into 426 skins and 44 maps for CSS, 469 skins for hl2, 14 campaigns for L4D, 16 campaigns and 70 skins for L4D2, 28 maps and 502 skins for TF2, 47 skins and 10 maps for Portal, and 29 skins for COD4. <br>
<br>
What makes us different from other sites is that we will only host the good stuff. Works in progress, bad recolors, broken maps - you won't have to deal with these. We will only host files that users will want to download. <br>
<br>
All these files will be hosted with Amazon.com's Cloud Storage System (s3), ensuring incredibly fast download speeds. As opposed to other sites, we will host these files ourselves, in the United States. No more dead links or broken mirrors. <br>
<br>
At launch, we will not have any advertisements. This will change as the site grows in order to support costs. However, none of our ads will have audio and none of them will distract users from their browsing experience. We hope to generate enough revenue through ads to funnel money into eFPS leagues as prize money. <br>
<br>
What sets eFPS apart isn't simply the high-quality user experience. We will be the only site on the internet for one-stop shopping for FPS games. With skins, maps, news, forums, and leagues all in one place, we will create a diverse and thriving community dedicated to all aspects of the FPS-player's experience.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
And I'll support this however I can in hopes that it grows to something awesome.  Personally, I feel like very few sites these days are run by cool, down-to-earth people FOR their community rather than themselves (look at IGN now) so I definitely hope this turns out as a success story.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Fallout 3 / Oblivion does have a good site for mods  ( <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com" class="postlink">www.fallout3nexus.com</a> / tesnexus)<br>
<br>
However when you look at the top 100 it's mostly visual stuff and nude skins, and both games are RPG's with a first person view and not really FPS , anyway that's just a point of view. If he were to include Fallout, all he'd have to do is grab the top 100 files and it would be a good start.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

In terms of looks, browsing and quality Im sure. Is the average joe going to be able to upload stuff to the site? If not, fps banana will still have a lot more traffic unfortunately.

One of the main problems with FPSbanana is that they are constantly infected by viruses because they allow user uploads. We may allow user uploads in the future. For now, if you see a skin or map that you think makes the cut, PM me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Indeed, those and the ads, but if you could be able to check that in some way you could cut that out of the equation. That or perhaps require a certain amount of posts or something from the member to be allowed to upload to the site. Seems like you will be doing a lot more work then you will need to if you dont allow some users to upload their own stuff.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Reminds me of TFC's last great heave. TFC almost completely died when they nerfed bhop and clans like Zt. |404| ect retired, but then someone centralized a website, provided a really popular skin pack and a new breed of players capitlized on the nerfed bunnyhop and TFC went on to live another 2 years or so before to where it is now, finally dead.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Basicially as long as you are not screwing up your web site you should not get a virus in the website. <br>

FPS banana gets infections because their security sucks. People are either directly hacking their website due to flaws or their clients are getting viruses through outside websites that cross script usually ad partners. The ad partners isssue is very common.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

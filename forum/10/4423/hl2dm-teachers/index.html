	<div class="content">I have been wanting to post this for a while to ask the hl2dmers , who they think was a good teacher to them in this game to get them to the skill of what they are today , just post any of the players names and the stuff they got taught :<br>
<br>
 For me it was Teto which had some of the sickest xbows and best bhop which kicked my ass enough for me to understand "The Ways" <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Foz and Teto.<br>
Mostly tactics.<br>
Some good folks at EE a little on Movement.<br>
Some help from Nino and Dirk, specing LD and making recommendations.<br>
My horrible movement is product of lots of work on my own, first to strafe and then to bounce with no direction (to unlearn forward), and finally to add in mouse curve and strafe keys.<br>
<br>
Avoiding the crossbow and using the melee helped a great deal, movement and positioning wise.<br>
<br>
And i picked any tricks from wherever&gt;<br>
And just playing and getting owned for years.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i came into the scene much later than most of you, so i had influence from a lot of good players.  i would say the ppl that i learned the most from would be:<br>
<br>
--cerberus, who is the best natural gamer i've ever met. he got me into EE and helped me learn the basic principles of the game, the importance of weapon switching with regards to different fight situations.<br>
--grain, who showed me more advanced movement techniques, and how to yoyo, lead with the xbow, and a lot of fine tuning stuff.<br>
--zman, took a lot of time to help me with listening to the important sounds of the game and 1v1 strategy.<br>
--luke, has always been there to answer any questions i needed help with and was always a good friend to me.<br>
<br>
and also pretty much everybody in EE has helped me in one way or another</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">mostly, i need to thank Ghost (the formerly 911 Ghost?).  havent seen him on in ages.  we go way back to my snipe clan days and he was the one mentor to encourage me towards competitive play and advanced techniques.  i've really struggled to "unlearn" some bad habits from those days and "relearn" the weapons that were dumbed-down or removed from the servers i frequented.<br>
<br>
initially, neolinkster and nade maeggs taught me the very basics of bhopping and strafe jumping.  though the finer points still escaped me and i remained in the low 400's at best.<br>
<br>
edge and divinity both helped me refine my bhop.  but nihilist/christian really looked at my technique and identified a subtle flaw and explained it in a way that finally made sense.  then he showed me two very simple drills to practice.  when im not raging (lol) i can bhop in the upper 400's now and hit 500+ a few times.  but its still a technique that doesnt come naturally for me and requires a concious effort to stay smooth.<br>
<br>
edge, divinity, rev, zman, confused and luke have all helped me with tactics.  im a slow learner and prone to stubborness, but i do appreciate their helpful hints.<br>
<br>
and i'd like to give a special shout out to necrotosin.  he is just about the most unpretentious and gracious player i have met in a loooooong time.  he has gone above and beyond to work with me on aim arena, a map i despise and struggle with constantly.  thx dude!<br>
<br>
edit:  jellyfox for helping me with yo-yo.  and think it was phantom some saturday morning long ago that helped me with prop-jumping.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I recall learning the first bit of information regarding a bhop from Khaos Paradox and vdus biohazzard on overwatch in the early morning hours.<br>
<br>
I learned how to play the game with mLIQUID.  me and that guy spent way to many hours playing together, we got good together, we played on the same teams together, we started a l4d team together, mLIQUID is my bro of choice.  We use to spend a couple hours a night playing the jump maps on the dmu server, teaching others and bettering ourselves.<br>
<br>
I thank Sin-stacked like pancakes - BoSS Dodal - whatever u want to call him for helping me learn sounds and to use physic props in certain ways to let u know when people are coming/channel them<br>
<br>
I thank Slick Fro for numerous 1v1's together, over and over.  He truely helped me hone my skills and I give a lot of credit to him for the reasoning why I made it into flaS.  Without all that time together, my skill would've been nowhere close to joining them.  Although he turned to a complete douche after I joined them and started playing TF2 like a fatwomen eats cupcakes, he will remain a friend in the gaming heart.<br>
<br>
I thank ninojman for our L4D experiences as a team.  It gave me a broader understanding of teamplay, and it makes the teamplay in this game so much easier, something I thought would be hard to learn and don't think I every truely did UNTIL I played l4d.  Now I flow with my teammates much better, instead of trying to find them.<br>
<br>
I do not thank the Seagull tutorial at all, I watched that and went, wtf is this shit.<br>
<br>
when it comes down to it though, we all teach each other in the end.  Thanks everyone for a couple years of good games.<br>
<br>
oh yea, I just remembered this.  I recall playing against VX rapefruit and someone else with mL when I first started on lockdown, they made me want to get good.  does anyone remember that guy, or clan for that matter?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LukeGT421 - what can i say, you have helped, and continue to help me get better every time i play you. you pretty much rock sir. you saw past the noob when i first played you ( i have the screens, it was 35 to -3) and gave good advice consistently.<br>
Teto - despite the fact that you are a dickbag, you helped me a shit ton. <br>
Yard_Guy - you played me endlessly and would straight up tell me when i was fucking up and how, so thanks a ton to you as well.<br>
Conflict - your tactical genius helped me to learn to out-think my opponents. also you are goddamn sexy.<br>
Confused - you've always seemed to think just like i do in this game, and i always have fun playing 2v2s with you, great lulz bro, great lulz.<br>
anyone ive ever 1v1'ed has taught me something, whether they (or i) knew it or not, so thank YOU hl2dm community, you bunch of idiots.<br>

Zman - REALLY REALLY Fucking cool guy who 1v1'd me a lot back in my uber noob days. Played him first on LA I still remember that damn match, I almost won! : D<br>
Confused - Really taught me about a bit more strategy then what I had known before.<br>

<br>
when I played with 911 me and vox would play 2v2's during the afternoon time almost daily for a couple months.  then I pulled an 'Impala' and freaked out on everything DM related - thus ending a friendship.<br>
<br>
it's exactly how you called it to, an asshole (but who isn't at some point in their dm career), but he was a great partner to play with, awesome calls, smart player who can anticipate with ease.  His clear direction and calls helped us beat quite a few teams, even with me playing.  <br>
<br>
I remember beating confused and book playing with vox on caverns, that was probabley one of the best feelings I've had playing this game, thanks to voxtex. I feel like an asshat for not thinking of this sooner.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
.conflict for ALL of the 1v1's and 2v2's we've ever played. Good lawlz and intense games.<br>
<br>
all of .flaS for learning many many many team tactics with them. except zman who failed to mention me in his thanks post even though i co started flas with him. didnt even thank me for the name of the team. asshat.<br>
<br>
yard guy for telling it how it is and helping me with 1v1 strats<br>
<br>
EVERYONE who made frag vids. <br>
<br>
all of ewR who taught me how to not be so serious and have fun. You guys are a trip. <br>
<br>
DEFINITELY many many many thanks to walking target and everyone else who got the university going.<br>
<br>
Yeah I dont have many thanks to people for teaching me. No one really taught me tactics or helped me with bunnyhop or anything else. I just learned most of it from experience. I'd have to say yard_guy gave me the most verbal tips. However I learned how to play smarter and sneakier thanks to conflict. This guy deserves an award.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

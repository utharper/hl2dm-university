Server IP:98.189.244.99:27015<br>

It runs on a fat pipe out of Orange County Ca., on a dedicated machine. Good speeds and fast downloads. I will have Mani-Admin installed by early next week hopefully.<br>
See ya in the servers!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I understand your concerns. This is not an official FF server. This is my server and I am a member of FF. Therefor it is not bound by the FF parameters, just the FF ideals, by my choice.<br>
I don't yet know if I will implement spawn protection, and as of yet, to what extent I will enforce the reverse spawn killing rules. I will enforce the in-server attitudes though.<br>
In all honesty, I would simply like to see people playing in the server. Don't let the splash page scare you. The server's a work in progress. Also, listing some of your favorite maps might be helpful.<br>
I like to help.<br>
I'm a helper!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Reverse spawn killing is when you come out of spawn and kill someone who was gracious enough to let you spawn.<br>
<br>
On the FF servers it works this way:<br>
<br>
They have spawn protection but if a person spawns in front of you you are obligated to let them run away.  If you let them run away (making the mistake of turning your back on them) and they come out of spawn and kill you that is reverse spawn killing.  And that is not allowed.<br>
<br>
I don't personally like the spawn/reverse spawn rules but I do accept that FF was trying to address a set of issues they perceived to be happening on their servers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, i know how it works. I also know spawn pro creates a whole new problem of reverse spawn killing, when it is supposed to solve a problem in the first place.<br>
<br>
Spawn Pro is horrible.<br>
It disrupts the game, gets on the nerves when everyone is complaining instead of having fun.<br>
It makes for lazy players.<br>
Sometimes, folks accuse you of reverse spawn killing when they don't even see what you see, as in you spawn and folks are shooting your way.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">As of now the server is pretty Vanilla. There is no Mani-admin yet, and I'll leave spawn killing alone. I only ask that you keep it fun. And again, let me know your favorite maps. I tend to lean towards the eye candy style of mapping, and it seems that I am in a minority. So any suggestions will be taken gratefully.<br>
Thanks for your feedback.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well. im sure im in a minority when I type this. but, put on whatever maps you want.  I dont care about map rotation anymore, I just care about finding people to play against.  However, you may want to take into effect the size of some maps, since servers are rarefully full now days, a big map coming up could easily make the 3-5 players in your server leave.<br>
<br>
keeping it mod free is probabley the best bet for longevity- hit sounds are coolio - but I dont download them anyways.<br>
i enjoy the promo banner. boobs holding a platter of heart = win.<br>
<br>
thanks FF - always enjoyed your servers - and the people who frequent them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its just plain creepy to allow people to FUCKING SPY on the game. I really hate it.<br>
It is just plain wrong and doesn't solve anything, since folks just whine about it ALL the time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">hey juim. good lucks with the server. i'll sure pop in for a spell.<br>
<br>
a word tho: try to cater for ppl's maps prefs and first thing you'll take off the list are all the eyecandy maps. you'll find yourself left with only ugly looking "pro" maps that were "approved" by someone who quti playing dm 30 years ago and then the server still don't get played anyway lol. unless you have a bunch of friends who like coming in. and stay.<br>
my advise to you - put the maps you and your friends like and enjoy the game the way you want to. can't get any better than that.<br>
<br>
i'm also not a big fan of spawn protection. it tends to distort the whole gameplay and bring in the whining type. no SP - they just leave. which is great.<br>
Mani is only good if you're gonna use sounds. if you're not - don't bother with plugins.<br>

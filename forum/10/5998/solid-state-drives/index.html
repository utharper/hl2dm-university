	<div class="content">Hey so if anyone is still alive here,<br>
<br>
Have any of you used a solid state hard drive with windows xp?  I need a new HDD soon and I'd like to get a SSD, but I will not use win7, and I've read about SSDs degrading on winxp.  If anyone has used one on XP, how well does it work?  Is it worth it?  One possibility I might try is to just get a tiny little 64gb drive and use it only for running windows and having quick boot times.<br>
<br>
I see that Intel also has a toolkit you can download for their SSDs, and it is highly regarded and supposedly takes care of a lot of the XP problems also.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Buy one, install it and use like any other drive.<br>

Make sure you have the proper input on the MB if it is a ESata drive.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No, flash memory is completely different than magnetic disk memory.  Windows xp doesn't support TRIM and flash memory can't handle a shit ton of write cycles like a HDD can.<br>
<br>
I have read articles that explain the best way to optimize an SSD for xp, I was simply wondering if anyone here has actually used one on xp and wanted to see what their thoughts on it were and how much of a hassle it is, if they saw performance degradation, etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok, now seriously. Windows XP does not take advantage of new hardware. <br>
<br>
I believe even Windows 7 doesn't. You should probably go with Windows 8.<br>
<br>
Not only for perfomance. You'll feel a HUGE perfomance boost anyways. But the problem is that since hard drives don't die by just writing a lot, SSD actually do. So what you need is a OS that takes notice of this, and changes the writing-period. <br>
<br>
Standard: Every 5 to 10 seconds when writing. 30 seconds when idle.<br>
SSD optimized: Every 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
PS: This may cause you to lose data if you don't explicitly sync your RAM with your drive. In UNIX-like systems you may do this by typing 'sync' in a terminal. Anyway, when you reboot or simply shutdown your PC, it'll write everything in the drive. But in case of a power failure or such, you may lose data.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Been in the works for some time now and quite alot of bug fixes.<br>
<a href="http://www.adrenalinegamer2.com/" class="postlink">http://www.adrenalinegamer2.com/</a><br>
<br>
I found this interesting.<br>
<em class="text-italics">Verygames, our main sponsor and a leader in the gaming server hosting play provided us with 2 powerful DediGames AG2 servers. One is located in France while the other one is located in Germany. We've decided to create few servers like this:<br>
<strong class="text-strong">4 servers dedicated to "Original HL2DM" gameplay</strong>: 2 in France and 2 in Germany<br>
- 4 servers dedicated to "Pro" gameplay: 2 in France and 2 in Germany<br>
- 1 server in France dedicated to HL1 classical maps with "Pro" gameplay<br>
- 1 server in Germany with all maps and votable gameplays</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">List of fixes and changes</strong>
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>. Added : new map pg_catmouse done by Sadist<br>
. Added : cvars pg_sv_add_gauss and pg_sv_add_longjump to dynamically add this item/weapon/ammo in maps which don't contain them. Set to "0" by default meaning they are not added. A reload of the map is required if set in-game<br>

. Added : server settings are now included in .dem files so that you don't have to start a listenserver using correct settings (especially for gameplay even custom gameplay you don't have in your computer) before using "playdemo"<br>
. Changed : mp_forcecamera set to "0" by default (0:view all, 1: spectate team mates only)<br>
. Changed : bots are automatically removed when no real players (humans) are present in the server (green computing by using less CPU)<br>

which would have been completely ignored were they present in the hl2dmOB mod.<br>
you need to realize any port cannot and will never be the same as the old engine. fact is, there were changes done to the old engine as well through the years people just sucked up and went on with.<br>
the only bad things i can say about AG2 is the menu's gay colors and the fact you need to switch to the vanilla side and not simply launch and game and play. but is it better than the HL2DM OB? undoubtedly. it's been worked on by a top coder for years. he knows the engine backwards and has only improved on it. you should post your fix or bug or whatever request to J@nek on his website if you want anything changed because it can and it will be. but rule out an excellent mod just because its past doesn't make much sense to me. <br>
like everything else, it's all about hype and unfortunately AG2 didn't get much while a new, inexperienced mod did. all on a whim IMHO.<br>
why aren't there any US AG2 servers? dunno, guess we'll have to wait and see how many HL2DM-OB US servers we'll see once it's released.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

After some time of that everyone basically gave up on it. It really is not a surprise people are less than enthusiastic, now that the mod is pretty much dead with no player base they start caring about hl2dm players. But it is really too late because the main thing we needed back then was a match start but fios gave us that match start and that fixed the one terrible issue with running matches in HL2DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The main focus of the mod is indeed the AG2 mode, it is a source *mod* after all plus the devs are former AG players who wanted something similar in source. <br>
<br>
But - check the changelogs. HL2DM mode has also been included since the first version almost 5 years ago. Bugfixing and maintaining this is a lot of extra work on the part of the devs that they didn't have to do. I wouldn't call that ignoring HL2DM players or forcing people to play the pro version.<br>
<br>
The dev team have responded to the complaints that HL2DM players can never find a server running just HL2DM mode by setting up 4 HL2DM mode servers. Again, they didn't have to do this.<br>
<br>
As a former HLDM / AG player I'm undoubtedly biased in favour of this mod but to claim that HL2DM players have been ignored is unfair. It's the other way around, HL2DM players have ignored this mod and continued to complain about HL2DM's faults and Valve's lack of interest when there is the potential to have them fixed by a dev team that will happily do so.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Fearsome* wrote:</cite>But it is really too late because the main thing we needed back then was a match start but fios gave us that match start and that fixed the one terrible issue with running matches in HL2DM.</div></blockquote>
Which to this day still causes issues with entities vanishing on some maps. Starting a match in AG2 using it's native match features does not. Not to mention all the other useful match features such as steamids on the scoreboard, auto screenshots or keeping dropped players scores visible, which again have been ignored.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Like I said the main things we needed have already been addressed. We have plugins that restore players scores not that it is crucial but we have it. And we can run zblock if we want steam ids plus settings security. <br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with how much work was needed. Most of the fixes we asked for 5 years ago we were told would not happen because of this or that or they weren't going to touch the base DM. Since I have done some coding in the past I know the work load needed and can say for sure it would have been pretty easy to address most of our complaints 5 years ago in 1 week of work.  Now that the devs have realized the lame AG crowd they were talking about also stiffed them they are doubling back to try to get us back just like a guy trying to get back his old girl friend after he dumped her for a 1 night stand. <br>
<br>
We now know the motivations of the pro mod team are purely in their own self interest. The only reason they give HL2DM players anything is to try to save their dead game. If we all switch over they will have us dependant on them and will swing back to trying to screw us over push us toward the pro version of the mod. <br>
<br>
They have made every desparate attempt possible to save their own necks including renaming their mod from what it is to AG2 in a pathetic marketing attempt to get people to try it again. <br>
<br>
To me it just isnt worth the risk. It would be smarter to risk going with a new fresh mod like orange box where the dev may actually have the HL2DM players interest as his primary objective. On the other hand the systems work in HL2DM well enough. And the major issues I have with the game will never be addressed by any current mods anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you had spent a large portion of your (often limited) free time working on something wouldn't you do what you could to promote it? The goal of any mod is to get players after all, and if the target audience changes over time it would be foolish to ignore that.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with promoting your work or tying to generate interest in it, after all it's not like anybody is getting paid for AG2.<br>
<br>
The AG2 mode is still the main focus of the game as evidenced by things such as the new weapons and their associated models / code, but some of the HL2DM fixes have been decidedly non-trivial to implement and maintaining what is essentially two different games in one codebase is not as easy as you make out.<br>
<br>
The fact that the devs have done this should speak volumes about their *current* intent: to try to make the game work well for both styles of player. Whether that was their original goal or not is irrelevant. Times change.<br>
<br>
I think it was you who posted on this topic before but regarding playerbase as we're all well aware faster paced deathmatch games of any type are in rapid decline. (Personally I can't stand the now ubiquitous slow / realistic / etc shooters but I could write an entire thread about that so I won't get started).<br>
<br>
Anyway my point is that the playerbase for AG2 mode has followed this trend - the AG2 playerbase has never been huge as it's a specialised mod for people who wanted a specific type of gameplay that they have previously enjoyed in HLDM / AG. Gaining a large crowd of players was never going to happen, but trying to swell current player numbers is very possible if you target the right people.<br>
<br>
It would be suicide to build a playerbase then force them to adapt to a game which is not the one they originally wanted, so I really cant see that happening. However, if due to trying one game mode some players find they enjoy the other as well, this is a win as it also generates more interest.<br>
<br>
Regarding HL2DM:OB, I do think that having competition between the two mods is a very good thing and will keep pushing development forward. It should be obvious by now which is my preferred choice of the two.<br>
<br>
For HL2DM as a "dead" game, to have two viable alternatives isn't a bad thing is it? As players we should be supporting the people who are willing to work on fixing things for us because Valve sure as hell won't. Unless you're willing to throw $100,000 at them of course.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I remember play testing 1.6 version ag2 while sta was in full swing.  Added a bunch of cool features.  Was nice and smooth, then ag2 added some silly game at the last second and completed fucked og hl2dm.  Playing a scrim on hl2dm in the middle it goes "Game On" and then "GOOOOAALL Blue team wins!"  then you couldn't do any damage to the other team.  This was the end of ag2 in hl2dm leagues.  Never was addressed for weeks.  Which I'm sure cut the player base in half if not more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They really are not doing any favors to the HL2DM crowd other than attempting to split the community over another issue and divide up the server and player base into more fractions, a house that is divided cannot stand. If they dropped the pro mod completely and went all HL2DM I might just maybe buy into it. If they dropped HL2DM support I would have more respect for the mod and if they grew a pair of balls and just named it back to pro mod and forged their own path I would have more respect too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
He is not lying about the past between pro and og.  This goes back a ways when the mod was new in the first go around with cal in 05.  They convinced Cal's admin at the time to use pro for all matches, then changed the gameplay of og and never truely supported og saying that the pro version worked fine.   It had it's chance at becoming a stable of hl2dm being used in cal and in sta but both times lasps in playtesting made it unusable for league play and forced the league to switch back to og in the middle of the season.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

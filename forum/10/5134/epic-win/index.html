	<div class="content">BTW, don't sound so offended Panic,...not like it's your best map right? 1911 beat you 22/2 there did he not? you asked him for a rematch, and it was about the same score again... <br>
I have the demo. <br>
You claim to be a top KBH player, maybe have you 1v1's there? Might do a little better. <br>
I'll admit you're better than me in most maps, but incase you wanna keep downtalking me, and talking shit, I have KAC ban SS's of you, among others.<br>
You have no reason to be talking shit about me. I'm just playing to have fun, and you try and start shit,.......<br>
I didn't know Valiums was in the game, if I did, it would have been different. I wouldn't accept a 1v1 anyways, not worth my time. I'm not ready to take on 1v1's with pro's yet bud.  <br>
I don't claim to be so great, or even good. <br>
I am trying to get better, and have fun. It takes time to boost skill, but I guess you don't have to worry about that right? You just fuck with your rates, and spam the shit outta people, and pray that you come out on top... <br>
So, thanks, come again. <br>
Being 100% legit never worked for you, but it does for me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

really? I have a big ego? Think you're talking about yourself there. I never once ever said I was good. I said I'm here trying to improve. <br>
and I play with better players to do so. And while in servers, I noticed you aren't half as good as they are. <br>
Which is why people like X-Death and 1911 rape you. If you were as good as others in LsD, you would have beat both X-Death, and 1911. Because many in LsD are much better players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

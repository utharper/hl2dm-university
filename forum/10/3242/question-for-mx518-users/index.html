	<div class="content">The only thing putting me off with getting the MX518 is the 125/s report rate, I tried putting it that low in the setpoint settings today and made mouse movements ingame look really choppy and unsmooth compared to 500/s and 1000/s report rates. Is that just the stock report rate for the MX518, does it have an option in the setpoint software to increase the report rate beyond 125/s for the MX518 like the G5 has? Is there another way to increase the report rate of just your mouse with increasing the report rate of all other USB devices?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Trust me 125hz makes it look like your game is a lot more choppy/looks like your FPS is a lot lower and unsmooth compared to say 500hz</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Err yes you can, I have a G5, I Installed the setpoint software just to test it out, changing the default 500hz to 125hz makes the game look like it has low fps and looks like it's skipping frames, I can tell this because my average FPS is pretty much most of the time 300, and you have noticeable skipping at 125hz. But I was reading on the MX518 benchmark and it says you don't notice any skipping even with 125hz and thats why theres no point in overclocking the MX518 to 500hz or even 1000hz.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes I run Vista 64 I had to find a workaround for it but it works.<br>
<br>
Oh btw it definitely makes a difference and you can measure it using the program linked below. It may not increase maximum response rate (maximum speed mouse can move and still be responsive) but it definitely decreases response time. At 125hz your mouse is sending updates every 8 ms (125 updates a second), so the delay for a mouse movement can be up to 8ms, on average 4ms. With 500hz your mouse is sending 500 updates a second which is every 2ms so the average delay is 1ms.<br>
<br>
The article measures something different.<br>

Here's the Vista x64 mouse fix package I put together. Read the .txt file for instructions. It works but your OS muse be in Test mode.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">thanks heaps vox, one question because I'm at school atm, does it overclock every USB port on your computer or just the USB port the mouse is plugged into? I've never really been 100% certain about this but when you change the report rate in setpoint, does it overclock the USB for just the Mouse or is that basically impossible, I've always thought that when done in setpoint it overclocks the report rate for just the USB port which the mouse is connected to (even though I don't install mouse drivers).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

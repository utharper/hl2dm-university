	<div class="content">Well I got two invites from two different steam groups today to ask me to join in hating some person or another.  I quietly declined both invites, because even though I have had disagreements with different people from time to time, most of the time (and there are a few exceptions), I try to let time heal all wounds and move on.<br>
<br>
So instead of spreading more hate around and bashing one person or another because they and I just dont see eye to eye, I thought I would share with you some of my favorite people in this game and why they hold a special place for me.   Here is a list, not necessarily in any particular order.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#0080FF">Walking Target</span> - for creating a place where we can come together as a community and share our love for a little game called HL2 Deathmatch.<br>
<span style="color:#0080FF">NinoJman </span>- always does everything he can to help anyone that asks, and is working and thinking as much as he can to keep the game alive.<br>
<span style="color:#0080FF">Fearsome</span> - Current leader of arguably the most successful DM clan in the history of the game, CAL DM Game Manager and DMU Board member.  Devotes a lot of time and thought into this game and how to make it better despite the criticism he gets for it.<br>
<span style="color:#0080FF">Valar </span>- makes some of the most beautiful maps for the game and probably has contributed more maps than anyone else to this game.<br>
<span style="color:#0080FF">StoneKiller</span> - My first DM teacher and clan mate.  Taught me how to play the game with class and respect for others through his example.<br>
<span style="color:#0080FF">Zman</span> - Always willing to help new and old nOObs alike to improve in skill and become better players, and has kindled the competative fire in me to keep going despite the beatings I take along the way.<br>
<span style="color:#0080FF">Grape Ape</span> - Khaos clan co-leader, without whom Khaos would never have been born or gotten as successful as it has.  My confidant and person with whom I can bounce ideas off of and keeps me in check.  Who never lets me forget that I once kicked his ass around a few maps and forced him to get better and can now give it back just as well as I dish out (sometimes better).  And whom also reminds me ( <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> ) that I am older than him.<br>
<br>
So I invite everyone to think about those people in the game that are special to you in one way or another instead of whom you happen to have a low opinion of because of some past disagreement or stupidity or their part</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yeah i joined the exodus one at first then thought....why? and left. and obviously im not going to join a group hating one of my clanmates... I agree with paradox that this GAME is too hate filled right now. maybe if more people in this GAME took it for what it was and just had a few lulz playing for once it would be more fun for the rest of us. ps, its a GAME not some sort of bizzarre social stomping ground. <br>

I declined both invites as well.<br>
I agree with you Paradox and with the other guy who said never expect perfection from others, nobody can be perfect. This is my first online FPS, started by the end of 06 and I’ve seen all types of dramas (some of which I’ve been part of, something I’m not proud of, but we all get dragged into them at some point) but the community praises icons for their skills, regardless of their attitude.<br>
<br>
Guess what newcomers think about the community when a cocky pro/semi pro player (which there are many) “pwns” them and trashes them as well, without anyone outside the pub knowing, aliasing or not?. And this happens a lot.<br>
<br>
Another problem is when people like exodus and some others are welcomed by the community and allowed to be part of clans with good people or clans in general.<br>
<br>
I was going to make a similar post on this forum but to be honest, I don’t fully trust this community. But thanks to it, I’ve come to know more about some people and been able to trust them more, which is good.<br>
<br>
But I’ve been able to meet cool people as well.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#00BF00">Hooked </span></strong>	Bro.<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="color:#00BF00">Beasley</span></strong> 	Bro as well.<br>

	<div class="content">I believe there is another issue here other than just hate.  Why would groups like that start in the 1st place?  And why would so many people willingly and quickly join a group whose only purpose is to tell someone that they suck?  <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: hey<br>
Weasel Force: yo<br>
.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: so, what's up with the group?<br>
Weasel Force: for the lulz mostly, but also because nothing is being done to ppl who act like assholes in this game.  so i made a group to let one of them know that what he is doing is lame, and he needs to realize it, i cant go somewhere like the university forum and post something cause itwould just be locked or deleted, so i made the group<br>
.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: you got alot of people to join pretty quick<br>
Weasel Force: ya, was easy, when i 1st started it, before i rly starting promoting it, ppl were actually asking me to join while i was in game, that's why i switched it to a public group.  when i started promoteing ppl were like fuck ya, i'm in, i hate that bitch too<br>
.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: so who are you anyway?  why do you hate him so much?<br>
Weasel Force: an old clanmate of exo.  he left but his stank is still lingering on servers, he's just a dumbass man, he fucks up the game with some of teh shit he does.  he gets tossed from a clan or leaves when ppl get tired of him changes him name, cleans out some of his friendslist and starts kissing the asses of the next clan, before long they figure out what his deal is and he moves on again, its just lame, XS probably didn't know what they were geting when he joined, lol<br>
Weasel Force: his reason for moving on is always that hes too good for the last clan, but he sucks<br>
.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: did you do make the phantom group too?<br>
Weasel Force: hell to the no david blaine, phantoms a nice guy, i'm guessing exodus made that shit after i made this one, apparently he thought phantom made it and decided to fight back, the douchebag was too chicken shit to stick with it tho, after he made it he left, lmao<br>
.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: but who are you tho?  do we know each other?<br>
Weasel Force: i cant say, im keeping this alias a secret<br>
.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: don't you think that's a little cowardly?<br>
Weasel Force: maybe, dont care tho, i accomplished what i wanted, showing fuckface that he's not welcome in this game anymore<br>
Weasel Force: most of the ppl who joined did it cause they wanted to, were excited to join, they joined to help the cause of justice man, im the voice of justice in this game<br>
.ewЯ|Uncle Rico {EE} #hl2dm: lol, ok<br>
Weasel Force: promote the group man, we need more</div></blockquote>

I think the guy's a little nuts, and maybe he's going about this wrong, but he's doing something not very many people are willing to do - to point the finger at someone being a jerk and unite people against the behavior.  Will it stop it from happening?  Probably not, but it may help someone realize their actions are unacceptable and if they keep it up, a majority of the community may end up shunning them.  <br>
Hopefully that doesn't mean there will be a new group each week.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Some people like golf i know, some people want a little more action, heated battles, trash talk. lets face it, some people are easier to hate then others and its not like this guy, the other people on the group, or myself are picking on someone who is completely nuetral, who doesnt have a bad thing to say about anyone and just minds his own business.<br>

for ''back in the days'' everyone at the fios was really damn good.<br>

Think about it as watching the very first king kong movie. Craptastic right?<br>
<br>
Well for it's time it was teh shit, the big deal. Same for fios footage/players. And eventually people that are good right now will eventually find their match through new players who, instead of growing with nothing to start with, grew up within the U with instructors, maps, tutorials a wiki etc etc<br>

So you are saying those players are talentless?<br>
FIOS was a pretty cool deal.<br>
What makes you call it a joke?<br>
Drago, TLC, Modal, Ozzy, MotionK, Dirk, Mario... these were NOT very talented players?<br>
You say FIOS was a joke. Easy for you to say.<br>
Those folks ALL had to beat some very good players even to get there.<br>
Go back and look at who was playing in FIOS.<br>
I remember folks like The Mechanix, MFYA, Twitch, 911...<br>

Seagull - for making a badass bhop tutorial that pretty much got me started with the hop<br>
MeekMeekle - he brought us caverns, one of the best maps in the game<br>

Punk- first off id like to point out that punk has the greatest attitude in the game. Hes the guy that should be running the show!  he knows what the game needs and where it should be going. listen to this man!<br>
<br>
Nino- as far as leadership goes Ninojman is a close 2nd, really like what your doing with the draft night and what you have been doing with the game. <br>
<br>
Blas- played together for a long time now. have beaten the best teams no doubt, hopefully beat some more in the future. <br>

<br>
Kandy- Yea real for sure, you seem like you got a good understanding of whats really going on.<br>

Now... seriously... stop all the bs.<br>
2quick ...I never had a problem with you, and our few matches were really fun, but I can't really agree on what you are trying to do no this thread <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> I'm not trying to say it in a bad way...<br>
Now I was just talking to  a friend and he said "dude the community has turned into such bs. it's all 1v1 people and who is better than who"<br>
And I agree.... lots of people try to prove themselves they are better than others....asking for 1v1s not for the fun of playing, but to see who is "teh_shit"<br>
I recently saw a 3v3 because I was bored so I got into a source tv. Every kill = spray.... what kind of game is that? =/<br>
I think some people need to learn better the concept of "friendly rivalry" as impala said a while ago.<br>
Doesn't matter how rude the other player is ...try to stay quiet.... otherwise you turn into the same he is ... makes no sens.<br>

Nino: He is the man, an expert barrel roller and let me on his team no questions asked, he is always chill and keeps me busy in this game too.<br>
<br>
Luke: Always teaching me something and doesn't care how long it will take, always been cool with me and a big help.<br>
<br>
Dingle: Fuckin hilarious and didn't hesistate to come play a game with me in a little home server on a brand new wacky map and still had fun.<br>
<br>
conflict: Always cool and chill, giving me tips that most people would never think of and always up for a good conversation.<br>
<br>
Fearsome: For everything he does for this community and if you don't know something about computers chances are he does. and will help.<br>
<br>
Kyle: You may never experience a game to it's fullest until you play one on teamspeak with Kyle.   good<br>

Plasmo: My partner in crime and old school trainer, this dude is the shit.<br>
<br>
MeekMeekle: Another old school trainer and another good friend always good conversation and games, and a great mapper.<br>
<br>
The folks over at EE: Probably wouldn't have joined CAL if it weren't for EE, and the randomness is just crazy enough to work for me.<br>
<br>
My fellow clan mates: I could write some pages on this, they know they have my respect and more.<br>
<br>
Onti: He is a good dude, and helpful but he's cool enough that I will go play with him on a 250+ ping with 40 choke and still have fun, that means a lot, all of LsD at that.<br>
<br>
Jelly Fox: Cause he's wild like me and we get along naturally easy.<br>
<br>
Pig Popper: Can't be stopped when it comes to helping out, a good dude and a hard worker.<br>

Snipe: Man we've been hanging out in this game for what seems like forever and he always has something different to play with, I used to stay on his server hooked I can only imagine the shit he's doing with console creation by now.<br>
<br>
Ninjins: He's chill with me and one of these nights we're going to get wasted, old style.<br>
<br>
Swot: Without Biohazard I would slap the shit outta myself.(somehow I would know about it regardless of it's existence)<br>
<br>
Stoopid and Modus: Who can make a pub server fresh in this day and age and fill it like they do?<br>
<br>
Phantom: We always end up in the same game somehow, and it only gets better from that point.<br>
<br>
Tim0z: Cause he just don't give a fux, 08<br>
<br>
Keeper: Scary to think what we would do without keep.<br>

I will say that in the last couple of weeks I have learned who my true friends are in this game. <br>
<br>
These are the people that despite the bumps in the road, try to work things out.  They don't offer ultimatums or place conditions on your relationship.  They don't use you as a stepping stone in their own ambitions or agenda.  Finally they are people that are honest and straight forward rather than stringing you along with lies or vague statements.  <br>
<br>
Yes this is a game and people think they can hide behind the hollow digital image on the screen.  It is a false sense of security which often causes people to let down their guard.  Unless you completely refrain from any personal interaction, you can not hide your base personality. Whether you know it or not, some part of it is projected into this digital realm no matter how hard you try to stifle it.  How you conduct yourself and how you relate to others says a lot about who you are behind the keyboard.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

These are the people that despite the bumps in the road, try to work things out.  They don't offer ultimatums or place conditions on your relationship.  They don't use you as a stepping stone in their own ambitions or agenda.  Finally they are people that are honest and straight forward rather than stringing you along with lies or vague statements.  <br>

Yes this is a game and people think they can hide behind the hollow digital image on the screen.  It is a false sense of security which often causes people to let down their guard.  Unless you completely refrain from any personal interaction, you can not hide your base personality. Whether you know it or not, some part of it is projected into this digital realm no matter how hard you try to stifle it.  How you conduct yourself and how you relate to others says a lot about who you are behind the keyboard.</div></blockquote>

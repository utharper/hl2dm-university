	<div class="content">Nexuiz is cool. It has Painkiller movement. As far as how it looks, wtf you all talking about?<br>
It looks great.<br>
Do you have the newest graphics?<br>
Huh?<br>
It looks better than Q3<br>
<br>
It uses the CryEngine 3, which will support the next Crysis 3.<br>
If your PC doesn't support shit, don't play shit</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">There is no Tau. But there are energy weps and rockets that you can use like a tau for movement. Never played the classic one but a lot of classic players switched over to the new one.  The movement isn't that complicated, but beneficial to learn how to use it.  The game is extremely fast paced and its all about armor control.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its really easy to learn the movement basically they call it pogo jumping and indeed it does feel like that. I would say that it tops quake in movement simply because you can strafe while in midair and maneuver yourself before falling. Here you don't need to strafe jump in order to get speed because you automatically move towards the location you are pointing at when you bounce of the ground. Also I forgot to mention that to bhop all you need to do is keep the jump key held down so you can concentrate more on aiming rather than timing your jumps. I would say that for $10 its worth giving it a try there is really not much to lose. It is very competitive since a lot of the players (like Bob mentioned) are moving over from the classic Nexuiz.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think you mean to say this has happened for the entire history of the world for humans.<br>
<br>
Back in the day Romans found it dishonorable and a sign of impending doom if they weren't in war and winning the wars. In Sparta the warriors there actually had more stress as their training regimen when not in war was even tougher then actually going to war. <br>

Yea that doesnt make any sense to me either, though wat i think he(ace) getting at is something like this.<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN6_RYAP8WA" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN6_RYAP8WA</a><br>
<br>
The info under the video really makes a point well.<br>
<br>
"All this was inspired by the principle - which is quite true in itself - that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so are brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes."<br>

Yadda Yadda... It's like America started the day some folks reached puberty! <br>
It's like saying we need another complete political system.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem is the monopoly of Gubbmint schools, crowded with Leftist Teachers, churning out ignorant young people who grow up to whine about everything, but don't vote, don't run for office, don't pay attention, don't know who the Secretary of Defense is, don't understand the Constitution and self gubbmint...<br>
<br>
Less than 50 percent VOTE. Many don't even take in the News.<br>
Folks don't even know who their REP is, or their Senator.<br>
<br>
Fuck, 50 percent of Americans don't even pay income tax, so why should they care if the Rich are soaked!?<br>
<br>
There are many solutions, one is to get the Federal gubbmint out of many things and simplify.<br>
Instead, we pass huge new entitlements.<br>

	<div class="content">Politicians will always kick the can down the road.  We will borrow ourselves into oblivion to push off economic collapse, and then when we can't borrow any more, we will print our currency into oblivion. Will it be Mad Max? No.  But the middle class is going to be decimated and many, many people will not be retiring.  Medicare and SS will have a higher age of eligibility, means testing, and lower benefits.  Bottom line is the US standard of living is about to take a huge hit.  People that don't protect their assets will be wiped out financially.  The populace will be screaming for the politicians to do something, and you can bet they will.  I realize this sounds like doomer crap, but when people were warning  6-7 years ago about things that have already happened, they were written off as lunatics.  The lesson there is that the population at large has a tendency to hope for the best and ignore evidence to the contrary.  You may look around and say, hey the shit hit the fan and the world didn't end.  Well, right now, we are playing our last card to stave off collapse, namely running 1-2 trillion dollar deficits.  The US has been on a debt binge, and the federal govt is the borrower of last resort.  The only thing left after that is to run the printing presses, and technically, that has already begun as current Fed policy is essentially equivalent.  The much ballyhooed end of QE2 will soon be followed by QE3 and QE4.  <br>

Jesus, Im in no mood to debate 500 things with you on this cause it would take forever, way to much effort, and it will change neither of our minds lol. Lets just stick to the fact that they are one and the same with the same agendas, cause they are. Here is my question to you. With all these terrible things that the democrats have pushed through to us (and many are terrible), why hasnt the GOP reverted them? Are they incapable of doing so? No, they dont want to because without them they become worthless and unneeded. You seem to forget that I am not a democrat. I want small government and want them to stay the fuck out of my paycheck and my life, but I can not support the current GOP or Dems, as they may have seperate talking points to get votes, their agendas are exactly the same when you filter through all the bullshit. I will say that there are a few here and there that are popping up with the right mindset. Christie is one of them.<br>
<br>
And dude, I am not Illinois. I live here, but I dont live near Chicago or have a say in who becomes our government. I am 1 vote lol.<br>
<br>
ps, This statement <br>
"What doesn't threaten America? The wars, which will end and cost less than the Porkulus" <br>
Is ludicrous</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol, ive seen a few videos of republican congressmen lying they asses off in public gatherings in town halls, and getting yelled at as a result, in one case a women was arrested for simply asking a question the guy didnt like. Which is obsurd considering these townhall meetings are usually quite loud apparently, and it didnt even get THAT far.<br>
Even Obama lied his ass off about what he was going to do wen he got in. Though in regards to Iraq his excuse was that the goverment informed him on some top secret information and that changed his mind, makes u wonder wat they told him.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

......please<br>
Just to give you an idea of what most of the state has to deal with when it comes to Chicago and their votes. Look at the state map and all the red and then check out that small part of blue, ya, that is Chicago and their voting power....<br>

What an incredible collage! Excellent.<br>
<br>
If elected, i will immediately work at closing the Depts of Education, Commerce, Transportation, HUD, Energy, and replace some of them with an advisory board plus perhaps a Tech contest to field real hydrogen cares.<br>
<br>
I will slash all other budgets except Defense by 25 percent, although i will bring back everyone in Korea and Europe, end any peace keeping in Bosnia or whatever the fuck, and start to leave Afghanistan, because it's fucking Afghanistan, a shithole that will never work.<br>
<br>
I will stop any payments to the states for any reason except disaster and push Medicare to whatever the States want to run.<br>
I will push the Fair Tax and fire the IRS.<br>
I will stop all foreign aid to shitholes who hate us like Pakistan. Fuck Pakistan. And fuck all the Muslims. They can kiss my Pike and Shield.<br>
<br>
I will tell the Palestinians to EAT FUCKING SAND you terror bitches.<br>
I will take my first vacation in Israel and hang out with Benjie! He's badass.<br>
<br>
I will work to add more restrictions to abortion and defund those Planned Parenthood assholes and those idiots at NPR.<br>
Unions...they will never visit my WH. If Fed. Employees strike, i will fire their ass and put them in the unemployment line with everyone else.<br>
<br>
I will work on law to force the Federal Reserve to lend dollars at a constant rate of X percent and use 1 percent to pay down debt every year. The Bank Market will then compete for your loans and stabilize rates.<br>
<br>
There will never again be any bailouts of any kind. If you asswipes don't practice risk management and set aside assets to cover your butts, then BYE BYE!<br>
Someone else with sense will pick up the pieces.<br>
I will also kick the shit out the SEC and FCC and bring some sense.<br>
I will fix Fannie Mae somehow. Maybe send them all to GITMO.<br>
<br>
Social Security and Medicare WILL have means testing. Multi-millionaires are millionaires. They don't need shit. They are rich.<br>
There will be a reworking of tax exempt health accounts and youngster will be encouraged to buy a high risk low premium policy and pay for their maintenance.<br>
Health care prices will drop if folks BOUGHT the services themselves and stopped clogging ERs for boils and Alcohol poisoning and fricking Colds!<br>
<br>
The Poor will have to start making efforts to become unpoor or fuck off. Their lives are their responsibility.<br>
<br>
Also, there will be no fraudulent Climate Change/Warming nonsense from me. Glaciers and ice melt you dumbasses. If they didn't the world would be one massive ice cube.<br>

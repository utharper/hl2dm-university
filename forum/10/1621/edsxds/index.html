	<div class="content">I was on there pub the other night,  They aren't sure what to do with cal, they need help getting better.  And enjoyed it when i went to their server and gave them a good challenge.  I told them they need to just make one team for cal.  Play the season out and then see if you have extras for most matches then make a 2nd team.  But with 2 now that can be to hard.<br>
<br>
But any way go stop by their server.  Give them some tips as you see fit, challenge them to a scrim etc.  They look forward to cal just need some help atm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think if they want to improve their CAL play the first step I would do is clear the spawn protection from the server. This really changes the way you play a game and playing with it on decreases your reaction time as you learn to instead just run away from a spawner and do not learn to quickly slaughter him. It also does not teach someone spawning how to deal with quickly starting the fight and defending them self. Also would help to run more CAL maps so they are familiar with them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

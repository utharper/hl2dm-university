Yes but there are frag videos who do all of the above. Frag videos like coL's 2005 ESWC documentary/frag video and Quake 3 Arena's Virtuosity were groundbreaking and only featured the worlds best respective players and legit kills at the time. As a person who used to play CSS I think it's a little disgusting to watch them showoff staged shots, to me they're taking a cheap shortcut. But yea entertainment for masses, what can a brotha say?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's bullshit you said you were with him in a team, no one from europe plays with americans I can assure you that and I played css for 2 years + i never said anything about the hours cause i know some ppl that play that much. And I still follow the css scene and i can assure you krystal ain't in a topteam he never won anything big so if you have 110 hours then well that's ridiculous, Verygames, dignitas, LLL play about 50 hours and those clans make money playing this, so your argument about playing leagues and having 100hours is shit. And why shouldn't krystal cheat in a league how can you be sure he never did it? Don't say because he never got caught by aequitas, cause there are more bypasses for aequitas than players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I didn't pay attention to the "month" part on WT's post. I just saw the number and thought about the 2 weeks count that steam is based on, in which case my calculation was right (considering it was 15,7 hours or around that, can't recall...)<br>
<br>
On topic: I haven't been able to check this video yet, my current conditions don't allow me U_U.<br>
But I don't like clayman at all, he thinks he is the shit or something... and I don't really trust on the "official" scores of the videos.

	<div class="content">frag movie was well edited and had some good kills in it. As for cheated players and stage frags well can't tell its always disappointing having staged frags for frag movie just to show off how good you are. I try not think if it is staged or not and mainly focus on the editing. Because really it the producer that doing all the hard work not the players (they the freak lazzy lot and the producer the guy that put out time playing to make it).It should been seen more as a form of entertainment than as a medium to show off. <br>
<br>
As for CSS frag movie well I try to keep a open mind I do h8 the game and find is boring as hell but I do admire the frag movies made by that community. I find it very impressive to that producers can get very boring css footage and manage to edited it to the point of being entertaining. With hl2dm well it never need that much attention you can cut and paste the footage together with a track and it will entertain by it self.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was talking about krystal, no german 15 year old guy that never goes to LAN in his own country will go to america to play a LAN, when you'll know you won't win much or win nothing. Cause he has never been top europe. So maybe you should stop lieing, btw I think it was obvious that i was talking about krystal because i believe you maybe went to a lan in america with energyshock with a krystal but not with the german krystal.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well in the beginning i specifically said that I'm talking about the german Krystal and that's the one that comes in all those movies with fake actions and hacking (those shots are possible but this guy is just shit so he needs hax to do it) Anyway looking at your posts now, I see that you never said he wasn't from germany when i said that a lot, as you never said that he wasn't from there etc so you still were lying about him and that was my point the whole time.<br>
<br>
Btw: I used germany 7 times twice i said he's from germany, ok ok i wasn't specific  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

coL was an american team ( they left coL now) core was an american team they splitted now and fnatic had one css team and they never went to america. Only 2 of them played in CGS and coL and core were american teams in CGS so i don't know where you got the information from. And people over here don't even go to a lan in another country that's nearby to theirs without having an organization to pay their travel. As long as you don't give any proof so i can believe you then no one in here will believe your fabulous story that went from I played with krystal in the same team to I played with some guy that lived in germany on a LAN.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

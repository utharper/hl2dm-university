Regardless there won't be multi-player similar to HL2DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The only reasons most of these FPS games are even mildly successful these days, is because of the multiplayer. See the Call of Duty franchise or the Battlefield franchise for instance. If they don't put some effort into the multiplayer portion of the game, they're going to burn out the desirability of the game when it comes to longevity.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hmmm...ign is a fairly trustworthy site that does their research (or at least I thought so).  I would think there would be a retraction on their website if they realized they made a mistake?!?!  Oh well, I think there will be rumors of HL3 for possibly years to come, just enough to keep our mouths salivating!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi, <br>
<br>
i'm a european hl2dm-player, my clan is de|mon.<br>
<br>
Now to my question:<br>
<br>
I saw that you play with friendly fire off in the ca-league,<br>
<br>
in europe we play 2v2 or 3v3 - matches always with ff on.<br>
<br>
I think ff on is the best for 3v3, but not for 2v2 - don't know why ^^<br>
<br>
So please give me some arguments or reasons why you're playing without <br>
<br>
friendly fire. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">What luke said.... you can't expect much from your team mate to help you in certain situations with friendlyfire on. For instance ... you are in a 1v2, and you call ur mate. He spams the place with an orb, or shoots and rpg. You will surely end up dead. And if he goes with a magnum, which he can hit you nontheless (but that would be harder) he might take both down, or maybe not, But you surely won't be able to stay alive.<br>
When a mate needs help, going quickly and spamming the place where he is at, is very common, and wouldn't be possible with friendly fire.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It adds a much more advanced gameplay and tacitcs to the game. Its like activating a new harder level on dm <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I can see it from both POV.<br>
<br>
Europeans like FF on because they feel you have to more cautious with spam and it takes more skill to kill your opponent without harming your friends. <br>
<br>
US players like FF off because they feel that the game generates too many random kills already, and enabling FF will just make the game more random, which for them means less skill. In addition, scoreboard is badly broken with FF on.<br>
<br>
Both are valid arguments IMO, it is really only preference and what you are used to that separates the two.<br>

This has been a heated topic in the past, so just a warning in advance, keep discussion respectful or it will be locked quickly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Teamkills with FF off are the most hilarious things of all. On time I was projected into the ceiling by a table splashed by my teammate's RPG, and then fell to my death.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, but it would render orbs just about completely useless. It's not only orbs though, how many times have you been in a pub where someone throws a grenade or object past the person they were firing at and it just happened to get you instead. Randomness is annoying, and with FF on, you're essentially begging for random teamkills. <br>
<br>
So if by  <blockquote><div><cite>Grape wrote:</cite>making the team think more as one, considering each other's positions more, and moving more strategically.</div></blockquote> , you really mean "making the team attack less, take less risks, and generally just don't help your teammate when he's about to die", then yeah, i'd say you're dead on..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well me and my team just finished off our first league season with ff and it is tuff. im not saying it good or bad having it on its all down to your preference. ts is so vital with ff on especially when you got a player like me with a itchy trigger finger that will kill the first thing that moves. You have to constantly let your team m8 know where u are other wise you end up running into each other and kill one another. which can also lead to those dreaded DOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! moments lol.<br>
<br>
theres no need to argue about ff i would not say that with it off or one is better and  that it i only agree that it diffidently changes the tactics you use.<br>
<br>
i like ff off because i can<br>
spam with my team m8 next to them with out worrying that i will kill them<br>
can take random blind shots <br>
can trust my hears to hear someone coming and kill them before they see me <br>
<br>
i like ff on because i <br>
stand more of a chance of surviving against 2v1 because that imparess there ablity to spam me as long im close to there player<br>
won't get mindless spamming by the enemy team<br>
they loss points for killing there own players<br>
<br>
the most team kills i have done is 6 which is very high which had forced me to communicate more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Good points on both side. I've played friendly fire on semi-competitively, but in a different game: Counter-Strike 1.6 (CAL-O material, so it was all nubs vs nubs lol). Friendly fire works in CS because 1.) Most weapons are hitscan, 2.) You don't have random spawns, 3.) There is a RADAR showing your teammates, making things 30x easier to know if those footsteps are from your teammate (remember, CS has global footsteps, not loud and quiet ones for certain teams), and of course, 4.) General less spammage (grenades must be placed extremely tactically and timefully. The wrong flashbang can turn the tides, even with FF off). Maybe FF on would've worked for CAL's 5v5 CTF division since it was all spam. But then again, maybe it would've killed it even quicker. Hopefully, king_air can appeal to both audiences. (lol you will never see that map finished)<br>
<br>
I kind of miss "friendly fire" for Team Fortress. In TFC, you were able to boost teammates with pipe bombs and whatnot, well except for heavies. I miss TF2's needle boosting too. Made for some fun, but impractical, Pyro ambushes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Mostly all our clan games are FF on.. just allways has been the way in Europe.<br>
<br>
It does promote better comms, you cant just rush to a team mate and hose down every fooker there.... makes the game a lot more tactical.<br>
<br>
However we also played in a league ran by the TSGK  where all participating clans voted at the start for FF to be off. Was a totally different experience TBH... just as much fun but maybe a little less thought came into the comms and tactics. All the games we had in that league were probably some of the most enjoyable we have played tho.<br>
<br>
It can be disheartening to loose the plot as I did in a match 2 weeks ago, I must have TK'd about 11 times... felt terrible after, really let my guys down.<br>
<br>
Take a look at this match....<br>

Between eS and SF, some of the best clans in Europe.... look at the screenshot of Lockdown.

	<div class="content">I never understood why the orbs don't hurt the one firing them. All other weapons potentially can hurt you (even the mag I guess <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">  ). Maybe Valve figured noobs would kill themselves too often, never getting into the game.<br>
<br>
And speaking of noobs, the more of them on a TDM server, the worse it gets if you have ff on. So, for most players I guess it becomes a difficult transition from ff off to ff on, if you ever do it. Much to my surprise though, I've seen my kid play on several coop server with ff on. Can't see see the meaning of that.<br>
<br>
I've always advocated the use of all weapons to their full potential in this game. And I use spam whenever I see the need for it. However, even with ff on, a lot of European clans whine about the use of spam. Certainly, lostvillage and biohazard centers around who can control the rpg even with ff on. Lockdown not so much, but the better the player, the more use it has. ChocolatePeanuT if anyone has shown that the rpg has qualities beyond a mere noob weapon.<br>
<br>
Using ventrilo I cannot count the number of times we've asked for a green go to fire that orb to clear certain areas out. It's by all means not rendered useless just because ff is on. Yes, you get teamkills now and then, but everyone's aware of that, so nothing to get upset by.<br>
<br>
So, I like how ff reduces the domination of the spam weapons. And I like how it forces you to communicate more, promoting the team that does that part best. But maybe there's a limit around 4on4 or 5on5 where it's simply too cumbersome to keep track of all your teammates in order for spam to be really useful. FF on still seems more intuitively natural to me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

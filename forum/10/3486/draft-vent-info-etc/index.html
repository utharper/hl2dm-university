	<div class="content">Getting a time that works for everyone is difficult.  Too early and west coasters have problems getting involved.  Too late on a work/school night and you lose people on the east coast halfway through because they can't or don't want to be up at midnight.   It takes roughly 3 hours to get all the matches done with all the "Where is your 4th", everyone ready", BRB gota piss, get a beer, soda, water, w/e nonsense.  <br>
<br>
Starting at 6 with teams starting to get picked at 645.  Teams won't be finished until 7PM-715, the first round won't get started til 730 even if everyone is on the ball.  <br>
So now you are already up to 10:30 before all is said and done if you are lucky.  There were times it went to almost midnight.<br>
<br>
If you are going to make it later then Id suggest a night when people can stay up later without risk of being late to work or school.  But that also has problems as was stated by Cellar who has a life besides DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
and normally does when I don't have extra shit to worry about, people leaving mid picks etc.<br>
<br>
Also having more then one admin would make that easier<br>

Herb and cellar have talked to me about helping <br>

I don't know about this whole climate change. I've been told since before 6th grade that the oceans are rising, the ozone is shrinking and the world will be unrecognizable in a couple decades. <br>
<br>
Well, I went to the Ventura pier again last week, the same pier I went to as a child. Yep, the water is still where it was 15 years ago, huh. Apparently, the ozone layer is back in formation again too. Looks like that might be cyclicle. And I don't understand the significance of temperatures rising by an year average degree or two Celsius. Think of it this way, if the whole Earf were one uniform temperature, then maybe you could piss your pants about it, but temperature is way too dynamic for this statistic to be relevant to  the real world. A plant isn't calculating the average temperature of the whole year and shutting off when it gets to a certain point, and neither is the planet. Plants and animals adapt to varying temperatures throughout the entire day.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well put it this way, the ice age that occured and ended around 650 million years ago which covered essentially the entire globe was ended by the accumulation of greenhouse gases which ultimately caused an average increase in temperature of a degree or two celsius. In my opinion I think although C02 emissions are increasing, so is the funding and time put into improving technology in attempt to deal with such issues. I mean.. who would have thought in the 18th century when electricity was discovered that we would eventually be using it as a type of alternate fuel for powering veichles?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
err, i thought the most recent ice age peaked, in its Last Glacial Maximum about 20,000 years ago.  and i thought the Earth has been in an interglacial period known as the Holocene for more than 11,000 years. It was conventional wisdom that "the typical interglacial period lasts about 12,000 years," but this has been called into question recently. For example, an article in Nature argues that the current interglacial might be most analogous to a previous interglacial that lasted 28,000 years.<br>
<br>
anyway, here's food for thought.  co2 bad right?  all those cars contributing co2 to the greenhouse effect.  right?  c02 represents between 9–26% of greenhouse gases.  water... represents 36–72% of greenhouse gases.  omg!  what do hydrogen fuel cell cars emit?  WATER!!! ZOMFG!!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well looking at the history of the planet the deep freeze or ice age as they call it was mainly due to the earth orbit from the sun had changed where it was far further away from the sun during that time. It only just got back to ideal distance when it shifted back. They say we due for another one of these for another 100 or so year in the future. So ice age had nothing to do with global warming in fact it was not much of a issue then because we where around or had a big enough impact then as we do now.<br>
<br>
Global warming is real and its mostly proven we are greatly responsible for it. As some say its not what the name implies it just does not mean hotter weather it means more extremes in the global climate. There are those that look out there window and say what global warming and that worrys me  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused">. Its global and if anyone look at the world and not in there own little world they will relies that freak weather is increasing on the planet and it just not one of those thing that slowly changes it rapidly changes to a extreme and bites you on the arse. There already been forest fires in CAL and in Australia then there major flooding in Asia and then there when london come under a blanket of snow that brought the whole city to a stand still (which was a absolute joke a bit of snow and the whole damn city stops working).<br>
<br>
Its does make sense thought if green house gases prevent heat from the earth to be released out of our atmosphere and heat is essentially a form of energy how would that energy be released it just does not disappear. It just float about our planet and end up feeding powerful weather systems and intensifying already hot climates. <br>

Greenhouse gases aren't only produced by industry... volcanoes were largely responsible for the massive amount of C02 emissions all those millions of years ago. I don't know how people can say global warming is a lie and a conspiracy when there is solid evidence to proove otherwise.. fair enough the media and maybe even scientists might be responsible for blowing it out of proportion in making us do some tedious things in attempt to reduce C02 emissions, but you can hardly blame them when they are well aware of the possible consequences of global warming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The UH's current paper on GW theory was written by 52 Scientists.<br>
There are now 19'000 scientists that disagree with its conclusion.<br>
<br>
One must understand a few things.<br>
95% of greenhouse gas is WATER VAPOR we can do nothing about.<br>
CO2 has a margin greenhouse/warming capability.<br>
CO2 moves around in the environment. It does not just float around in air.<br>
GW Theory uses the last 100 years and stretches that out by modeling over the entire history.<br>
This is defective.<br>
The Ice record shows there is an 800 year CO2 LAG BEHIND warming, ie-Warming causes the CO2 rise, the rise in CO2 lags BEHIND the warming by 800 years.<br>
It is also defective to say the reverse gives the same effect, ie rising CO2 causes warming.<br>
The current trend since 2002 is COOLING.<br>
The recent spike in warming can easily be attributed to incre3ased Solar activity.<br>
That solar spike IS a FACT.<br>
The Southern Pole is GROWING ice.<br>
The current worst case forecast for seas rising is 23 inches over decades, not 20 feet..<br>
Current floods or hurricanes are merely anecdotes and not proof of anything.<br>

	<div class="content">For a second let's all forget who and what causes C02 and highest amounts of it. Let's all go back to a time in history we all fondly remember called the Cretaceous period when most of large animal population was utterly wiped out. While it's generally agreed a massive asteroid strike contributed largely to the mass extinction scientists have been puzzled about has caused the other half of the mass extinction, as it's now being widely thought that the asteroid hit was not enough to cause the levels of mass extinction seen during this time period. Science has begun showing us that C02 levels at the end of this period were astronomical, estimated to be 5x the level of C02 in our atmosphere now. The oceans became acidic, toxified and uninhabitable with the exception of a few tough species and vegetation as the climate heated up and intensified produced harsher and more toxic plantation that most large mammmals could no longer feed on over time. The acidic waters and atmosphere was no longer able to sustain large vegetation growth and oceanic life and effectively killed off tremendous amounts of life. After awhile of a quiet, toxic, earth environment laden with few living species the C02 levels began to regress, slowly buried under soils and oceanic waters over VERY LONG amounts of time. C02 levels were normalized because of a quiet period of time of little life, no major catastrophies, asteroid strikes or massive volcanic eruptions. This post is becoming way to long so I'll shorten the end here, basically we will if C02 levels continue to rise this fast will reach this deadly climate around the year 2300 (Now nobody will give a shit because us and our grandkids will be dead by then) and while as before the earth had the ability to naturally bury and recycle the C02 at stable levels the human race keeps mining, digging and expelling C02 at an alarming rate, and has no end in sight, there is a C02 level the earth can reach in which in the earth climate CANNOT recover period, and if we do not find alternatives and push the off switch on C02 we will have marked ourselves as one large miserable failures as a living species, not even coming to an extinction by other means, but putting ourselves into extinction.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

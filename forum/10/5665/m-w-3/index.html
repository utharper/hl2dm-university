Remember Vladimir Makarov from Modern Warfare 2? My guess is it totally has to do with it. What do you guys think?<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">supposedly activision is now sewing EA saying that they had a hand in persuiding West and Zepherela(sp?) to purposely alter the release schedule of the first MW2 map pack.  Activision is out of control. they have more money than God and they wouldnt pay West and Zep. their bonus money and are now going after EA.  there is no doubt in my mind they are doing this to try and fuck with the release of BF3 which is going to hopefully show COD drones what a real game is.  Dice also stated that they are NOT going to build BF3 for console and port it over to PC.  its going to be built for PC and then later tweeked for console.  FINALLY.   Im a Dice customer for life.<br>
<br>
BTW, West and Zep. started their own company called "Respawn Entertainment" thinking of buying stock in that place because i believe they legally still own the rights to the Modern Warfare name which has become a house hold name.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">OKAY SO IT'S NOT MW3 but it IS a MW2 Live Action Modern Warfare Trailer, the site no longer brings you to a countdown, but rather a youtube video you can watch the trailer here:<br>

Just watched it and was reminded of why the MW2 Single Player was soo good. Now of course you trolls will prolly jump on it and say bad things, but if you don't make films for a living (or for experience!) STHU PLZ! Because I do, and I know how much hard work is poured into these fan made films on low budgets. Very awesome trailer. Hope the actual film lives up to it!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

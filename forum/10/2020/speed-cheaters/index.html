I have seen 3 use speed hacks and one walked through a wall that you werent suppose to walk through also. Thanks for the server links though. Trust me, I dont cry wolf unless it is so obvious. When a guy is running so fast in a straight line and not hopping around and without running out of sprint power and is crossing the whole board in mere seconds, you gotta say damn wth.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> Anyways, I still got my licks in.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Excerpt from the site BI posted:<br>
<br>
Vitamin C to kill implanted alien-hybrid embryos<br>
<br>
Although aliens dont like perfume, it doesnt stop them from abducting humans, it only angers them. One woman who now wears a thought screen helmet along with her husband reports that she killed four alien-hybrid fetuses in a row by taking a gram of vitamin C every hours. She used her alarm clock at night to awaken her. She reported that she could no longer feel the fetuses moving and the aliens were very angry at the deaths of the alien-hybrids they implanted in her. The did remove a dead alien-hybrid fetus before implanting a live one at another time. This was before she started wearing a thought screen helmet.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

"NEW DIRECTIONS FOR 2008<br>
<br>
1. Prepare for a fight<br>
<br>
Aliens will try to stop you from wearing the helmet both mentally and physically. Remember that they can read your mind. Before you make one they may try to influence you that you dont need one. Once you start wearing a helmet they may harass you or perhaps threaten to kill a pet in retaliation. They are good at manipulating your spouse to have a conflict with you about wearing the helmet. If you forget to wear it one time they may physically hurt you. They have done these things to a minority of abductees wearing helmets. Most abductees report complete success with the helmet when they wear it as much as they can. "<br>
<br>
<br>
Funny this site doesn't note the correlation between former alien abductees and methamphetamine use.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

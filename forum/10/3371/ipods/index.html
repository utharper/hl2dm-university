	<div class="content">Anyone know of any good software that you can use to rip the music off your ipod?<br>
I had to reformat my girlfriends computer, and as most of you probably know, when you try to plug a ipod into a new computer it wants to reformat the ipod before you can put new music on it, so I need to take the music off that she has on her ipod and put it back on her computer.<br>
Any ideas?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
You Should have your library backed up on another drive and reconstitute that first.<br>
Im curious, did you really wipe out the library? And what do you mean reformat your Ipod when you plug it in?<br>
It just synces with the auth. library and the selections checked. It doesnt reformat the Ipod.<br>
<br>
Sounds like you want to just add music from another library to a new one, like a transfer, and you will need a true HACK to do it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
<br>
I hated going to parties and hearing a sick tune and i couldnt simply FUCKING ADD IT to my playlist in one click, everything suddenly turned into "MAC, its so simple" to "Fuck you, this isnt 2009 it's 1989" I had to fight iTunes so it wont sync my ipod to his librairy and then it turned out it was the only way to get the song.<br>
<br>
I can't listen to songs off my ipod while it charges if the computer im on doesnt have iTunes, it's ridiculously ressource intensive...<br>
<br>
<br>
For managing playlists and such ON A COMPUTER, okay np why not ,it works.<br>
But being forced to be tied to this piece of software in our era of open sourceing and user modification plugins etc, forcing customers to bind ipod and itune should be considered technologic nazism, im not even kidding.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's bloated beyond belief. I used to run it on my pc, which is by no means amazing but its not bad either. I would start up itunes and memory usage would shoot up from nearly nothing to most of my 4GB. I have at least 50 - 60GB of music on my pc, but this does not happen with any other music players I have used. foobar2000, winamp, mediamonkey, all of them did not freeze when importing this library. I would then try and close itunes but it would freeze, forcing me to a hard reset of the pc. This happened after numerous reinstalls and upgrades, so it was not a hardware conflict. It has the cheek to charge you 99c for a song and then restrict what you can play it on and where you can play it. All of those features you mentioned could be done faster, easier and without all the bloat in another media player.Apple Lossless codec is decent, but again its counter productive, why limit yourself to certain hardware or software when the alternative (FLAC) can be played on hundreds of devices.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So, even playing an MP3 and encoding ALAC at the same time, its using 50 of one of my procs. In fact that includes everything running.<br>

But, i got where you are coming from. Media Monkey may be better for you.<br>
It does seem folks are talking about their Ipods and not ITunes though.<br>
I have either archived ALAC or LAME Mp3s and can convert ALAC to Mp3, so why FLAC?<br>
I have an IPod. It doesn't support FLAC.<br>

Like what, winamp can group by artist, group, year of publication, genre and a whole host of other fields, foobar2000 can, as can media monkey. Winamp has an intergrated music store, you can get plugins to do that for both foobar and media monkey. You can rip to a whole host of formats in any of them, they all have album art cover finders. The only things I can think off that itunes can do that non of the others can do is cover flow, hog memory and purchase using iTunes, non of which I care about.. <br>
<br>
I have an ipod but I use rockbox (<a href="http://www.rockbox.org" class="postlink">http://www.rockbox.org</a>), so I don't need to use iTunes and I can play FLAC files.<br>
<br>

You can just use the iPod as a hard drive though and put the song you like on the iPod and transfer it to your own home library.<br>

I'm not defending iTunes. I'm not a big fan of it either. But with a new computer, I don't feel like it hogs much resources. On old ones though, it's a pain. At the moment, I have a 30.03GB library. It takes a while at start up to get ready, but other than that, I think it's fine.

	<div class="content">Thats to prevent folks from stealing music. Do you think you can download a Zune ?<br>
If it is YOUR music, there is not a problem in the world.<br>
<br>
<br>
What folks want to do is "Gee, let me have all the stolen music you have and just DL it from your player thing!!"<br>
YAYYY FREE MUSIC~~~! And super Easy!. Now i will play my stolen MUSIC while i rale on about IStore piracy!!!"<br>
<br>
My Library is all mine. I have most everything as an unprotected MP3 on a big HD. I could use the library with any player i would like. I dont have to use IPOd or Itunes. The classical i have is in ALAC, which can convert to MP3 and some Itunes.<br>
Backup your library= NP!, Use other players=NP, Add or Subtract any track i want =NP.<br>
Downloading my brothers music to my library =PROBLEM!!!!<br>
<br>
Having lost your entire library on your PC is the ONLY legitimate reason you need to transfer from player to library, and you are formatting because of Limewire theft in the first place.<br>
<br>
You dont even need a player to add tracks to your PC. Ever heard of burning to disc? Thats right, you COULD burn a disk or write and transfer.<br>
And the Ipod is the nicest player out there. It has the best screen and format. It pawnz most players.<br>
This started as an ITunes discussion, but several thingss lead to another discussion entirely.<br>
Beyond a dislike for the app, its really something to see folks complain about Apple because Apple is not assisting them steal.<br>
You can all commence to purging me from your friends list if its necessary.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, too bad that is not true. Even with a book, you are not allowed to use anything from that book in another enterprise without clearing copyright.<br>

This is really a sign of the times. The music business? screw that, I WANT IT FREE!<br>

Do you think artists eat AIR and fuel their cars with AIR or pay for studio time with AIR?????<br>
<br>
Sure, you should be able to stream your music or backup your DVDs. That is fair use.<br>
Theft is another thing.<br>
Folks love music and its understandable, but this notion that piracy has been going on doesn't justify YOU DOING IT.<br>

People have been "stealing" music since the cassette tape and Im pretty sure there was no fuss about it in the 80's that I can remember. You could record off the radio or a friends tape and it was no biggy. All this goes mainstream and the record execs start bitching because they are losing money that they never should of been making in the first place. They've been robbing people for years by having one hit song on a disc/cassette/album and the only way to get it would be to pay for the whole thing lol. 9 shitty songs and 1 good one, they banked on it for years and now that the odds are a bit more even, they whine. Boohoo, Ill never pay for music again unless it's a band that I fully support and feel they deserve my money. Hell, if you have a good enough system/speakers, you will find that alot of cds sound like shit anyways.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I got a bunch of Vinyls back home along with a couple of good turntables.  The only problem I see with that is how much does it cost to press 100 vinyl albums vs making 100 cds of the same album.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Murder has always occurred. Not that they compare, but you SHOULD see what i mean.<br>
It iS a rationalization and an excuse.<br>

Do not misconstrue. I don't care what folks do.<br>
I am not the internet police or a BMG rep.<br>
I DO care that folks think wrong is right because that is what they want to do.<br>
Not so much judgemental but instructional.<br>
Take it of or leave it.<br>
Enjoy your free music. I'm sure the artist likes being poor.<br>
Also, most artists and websites and Myspace and even ITunes have samples of the music.<br>
That whole argument is poot. RealRhapsody is another way to hear music for cheap, so DLing P2P files isn't even necessary.<br>

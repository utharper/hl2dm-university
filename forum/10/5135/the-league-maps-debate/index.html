	<div class="content">I’d like to start a discussion on the matter of the HL2DM competitive community receptiveness to new maps at this point in time because I feel this is very important, not only as a mapper. The following are my personal views. Let’s get a healthy and open-minded discussion going. As I’m sure you will all agree the future of this game largely relies on new levels to play as it does on new leagues.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Here are my 3 main arguments:</strong><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">1) <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Stats Factor</span></strong>: Competitive players fear of losing already gained stats, since playing new maps involves learning the layout and item/player spawns from scratch, they’d much prefer playing already studied maps in which they have if not an advantage at least not a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">2) <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Approval Factor</span></strong>: Incapacity of original thought. New maps seem to find acceptance mainly if not only via mapping competitions which is wrong. Not to take away anything from the competitions – they’re great and should be supported, however new maps should be able to be introduced and break through independently which never happens.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">3) <span style="text-decoration:underline">The Comfort Factor</span></strong>: “<em class="text-italics">I’m used to dm_old. dm_old is awesome. Why should I change?</em>” this is Fear of the New Things. Though this might sound over dramatic and raise debate, from my personal observation, this is a natural human trait. Although one you should keep in check and not let take over the wheel as it were.<br>
<br>
I want to point that a great number of competitive players I’ve spoken with often expressed their dislike of the maps used in leagues. Still you’ll see these maps keep on being elected again and again. Inarguably every map played in leagues today has in it good elements as well as not-so-good elements, some are damn great maps, some aren’t. But <strong class="text-strong">A.</strong> the fact that on a one on one basis people speak out against something and when they come to vote they embrace what they profess to dislike begs serious thought. And <strong class="text-strong">B.</strong> Old in itself is not a bad thing but the fact there is hardly anything new but circulation of the same stuff is far from ideal.<br>
<br>
Another thing to note is the fact that this game although lacking any attention from Valve keeps evolving its gameplay techniques as time goes by. And yet, this change in style is inarguably not reflected in new maps (with maybe the one exclusion of dm_airfusion, but only slightly).<br>
<br>
One last thing I want to point out is the fact that at least in my case, during playtests of a map I would get inputs from people, implement those inputs into the map only to find out the same people who gave the inputs now complain about a myriad of new other things they’ve never mentioned before. Some times I’ve noticed people not pointing out faults in a map and kept it to themselves. Perhaps as an advantage during a match?...who knows <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> but when the said map would be debated whether or not it should be used in league, those “hidden”, untold faults would surface all of a sudden and bring down the map completely.<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Sad to say Valar but its all too true.... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br>
In my experience in the european league, changing conservative minds is hard to do. Playing the same old stock maps is ok but in order to get this game out of the wheelchair there needs to a vision by its community. We need to look past the tired old maps and embrace our gods of dm, the mappers.<br>
Encouragement to the mappers are few and far between with the odd competition that stirs a bit of interest. Obviously newer games are out there and its hard to come back to this game once your into that latest game.<br>
<br>
But to the point ... ppl need to welcome fresh new maps and give them a chance...after all lockdown, caverns etc...faced this kind of ignorance i guess untill we as a community played them and gave them a chance till they came out of our ears.<br>
<br>
Fact is imao as in my post about pig popper coming back to mapping and the negative responses especially from that (rejected)<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=5130" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... =10&amp;t=5130</a><br>
is far far far from constructive.<br>
Welcome new maps</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hl2dm is split into many different groups of players.  There are only a handful left of community stock pubs in the USA which enjoy playing every stock map.  (SW) - Sniperwatch was the biggest one of these groups in their time.  ATL  (Clan leader)  had well over 3 gb's of maps loaded on his server and you would never play the smae map twice.  The [FF] and [MB] are others that come to mind when custom maps come up.  Always something fresh one there rotations. <br>
<br>
Then a small group of around 20-30 players that are into competition and only have time for practicing the current league maps.  Maybe try a couple here and there.   So really it was up to who ever made the map decision;  STA, CAL, Warzone, CU, now eFPS.  As the game went one the standards went up.  During the STA ladder (05) we pretty much played any map there was at random.  First match was dm_sanctuary_b7u4 a map with invisible walls and all kinds of random things.   The more maps that came out the higher the standards went.  With both Rhideon of STA and Fearsome of cal they both wanted to get rid of all the maps that had been in the league that were sub par to a certain standard or had lots of flaws.<br>
Both of these guys wanted lockdown as the standard and made them the finals maps of ever season they ran.   Fearsome had plently of little rules he went by in picking the maps for the season.  No more then 1 or 2 at most from the same mapper,  must have all weapons etc etc.  It lead to some subpar choices while good maps got overlooked but it was a standard that he put in place and made sense on some level (DGC maps come to mind as why this would be a rule.) .  Dal and I wanted more diversitiy and looked over some flaws for the sake of changing the pace and were willing to put in more new maps per season.  Can't say for CU since it doesn't have the same system of picking maps.  <br>
<br>
<br>
But fact is, new maps got into every season that hl2dm was played in a league.  So caught on and stayed for many season.  Some the players just didn't like for what ever reason.   I am willing to bet that over half of the maps in eFPS are going to be different and new from the last season of cal.  Mainly because of all the good options that are out there now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
1. Competitive players don't keep stats. They don't look at their lifetime KDR or something like that. No competitive server even has a stats plugin. <br>
<br>
2. Maps that win competitions get played only because people have been exposed to them. No one comes around and says HEY I GOT THIS AWESOME MAP TRY IT OUT outside of the Architectural Department. It's just a problem of exposure. And that's only the fault of the map-maker for not exposing more people to the product.<br>
<br>

I’ve chosen the wrong terminology here. I was not referring to stats in the sense of HLstatsX or any stats plugin or system. I was referring more to status in terms of level of achievements and acknowledgement in the competitive scene. Hope this clarifies it better.<br>

I can safely say that at least in my case, since I’ve started creating competitive maps I’ve been literally bombarding this and other forums with posts, ridiculous amounts of pimped to death screenshots, map logos and whathaveyou, to the point in which I might have even saturated the “market” somewhat :/. I’m not the only one as a matter of fact. PigPopper is just another example and there are others. Many others. The point it; exposure is hardly the issue here.<br>
Some examples:<br>
<br>
For exposure reference.  The <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=4149" class="postlink">HL2DMU Mapping Contest Final Results</a> thread had 3134 views. If that’s exposure then the following don’t fall THAT far behind, amirite ?<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=3361" class="postlink">dm_is_alive</a> – 1564 views<br>
Was played literally by hundreds of players from the competitive scenes in the US, Europe and South America. I might even had a few ausies in there at some point.<br>
<br>

<br>
There’s also Milieu with 2193 views. Was played once or twice I understand in last season of CAL. Everyone I know from this forum and slews of ppl I’ve never seen before arrived at my server to playtest it many times over and ALL gave inputs. All inputs were implemented into the final version. Read my first post to see what exactly happened there.<br>
There's assload of other maps and that’s just me. but hey, I’m insane and sleep in an ammocrate in Hammer. :/ le't's move on<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Here’s boshed’s <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=4151" class="postlink">dm_helix</a> – with 1033 views. This thing of beauty took second place in last year's competition!!! Completely overlooked and it’s a sick map and it was definitely exposed.<br>
<br>
Sadist’s <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=3756" class="postlink">dm_jaeger</a> – with 1475 views. inarguably exposed. people favored trashing his map instead of helping him sort out the things they claimed didn't work for them.<br>
<br>
There’s VitaminG’s incredible <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=4904" class="postlink">dm_ethic</a> – 560 views which is a sad count because this is an excellent map. just point out how a map can be so easily overlooked.<br>
<br>
I’ll stop here. <br>

That being said, every seasons should get 1/2 brand new maps (previously voted in by community) in the cycle in order to truly test it in depth. Some maps at the first sight wouldn't work in competitive play because or this or that and playing them over time could reveal otherwise. If the map is bad, then may it be avoided forever.<br>
<br>
You test new maps but hand picked ones. You force people to play them, wich solves the whole "people just wont pick new stuff, they'd rather pick the old stuff and do good on it" problem. You keep the mapping business alive and i'm sure some surprise victories and glorious gameplay could be caught there.<br>
<br>
Caverns was implemented this way and now it's the new 4v4 map.<br>
<br>
1) hold a mapping contest<br>
2) get a bunch of people to play the submitted maps<br>
3) in-house vote<br>
4) public playtest<br>
5) public vote<br>
6) compare/pick</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Its really a matter of freedom or enforcement in making new maps to be played in leagues. I like to air on the side of freedom of allowing the players to do what they want, I believe Holy believes in the same approach. If a new map is really that good new playes will begin demanding it and through freedom of choice it will come of age.<br>

<br>
I think this is a good point Valar and it speaks to what you are talking about.   <br>
<br>
Warlock and Jaeger_rc2 are good examples.<br>
<br>
Warlock was interesting from the start, looked good.  But was originally put down for cal only due to you already had one map involved in the season.  So it was left for another season which ended up not happening.  It go it's chance in the hl2dmU 2v2 tourney.  At that time before the play I would say it was 60 / 40 in favor for the map.  But after being played that turned to 40 / 60 against.   <br>
<br>
Jaeger_rc2 looked really good,  I would say (imo) it was 80 / 20 for the map.  But not many of those 80 did not play it.  Afterwards that turned down by a lot 30 / 70.   <br>
<br>
I am surprised I haven't seen anything on dm_helix  maybe it just doesn't have it.  Or the current group of players just enjoy other maps atm</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
In a sense yes.  I never did play it so I can't say.  Cannon was the same way.  Made by a trusted mapper and looked cool so we tried it.  After playing it,  you only use 1/3 of the map to win and there is now way to mount an attack against an evenly matched team to take it back.<br>
<br>
So when a map can be worked on forever but if the balance or flow is not there for competition it isn't there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, imo I believe most competitive players left are pretty open to new maps as long as they have<br>
1. Good flow (movement space etc.)<br>
2. Good weapon layout (not too many of the same weapon or the opposite, if there is an rpg can't be somewhere you can just camp and win etc.)<br>
3. Good spawns (not too close to each other, none/not too many in key places like really close to rpg spawn etc.)<br>
4. Just general map stuff like good fps, no character/prop/weapon glitches etc.<br>
<br>
I think those are the first points people (at least I do) look at when they first get in a new map. If all/most of the points are good enough for them then they'll start trying it in 1v1/2v2 or whatever applies to the map size and see what it feels like in competitive play. <br>
I also agree with vals on the point that some maps look great, you get in a server you try it out it feels pretty good looks good etc. but when it comes time to 2v2, you realize that the map really isn't what you expected.

	<div class="content">First thing that comes to mind is that I simply can't remember the names of all of these new maps. <br>
If the name is easily forgettable then the map is easily forgettable.<br>
Some examples with what I think could have been better names. Lone adjectives, adverbs, or complicated nouns are the enemy here.<br>
<br>
dm_avalon -&gt; dm_floating_isle<br>
dm_warlock -&gt; dm_autumn_breeze<br>
dm_is_alive -&gt; dm_superman<br>
dm_remorse -&gt; dm_lockdown2<br>
<br>
There, now instead of avalon, warlock, is_alive and remorse, you have FI, AB, SM and LD2<br>
<br>
<br>
Second thing that comes to mind is that maps have to be fun to pub on as well.<br>
LV, AIM, and Caverns and of course LD are great pubbing maps.<br>
Tigcrick and Zeta are not. These maps achieved short term success but died out because they weren't ever played outside of the league matches. In a pub, map balance gets thrown out the window. I think that too many map makers focus too much on trying to get that perfect 1v1 or 2v2 or 3v3 balance but they don't pay any attention to the 1v10 pub balance. Look at some of the old accomplished maps like backbone and swamplight and design your new stuff after those instead of trying to build some "pro-bhopping no-props impossible-to-get-rpg weapons-sitting-on-colored-lights-in-the-middle-of-hallways competition masterpiece".</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Most people in this community do not think that much about if they like a map or not. You need a number of factors to come together and you have a successful map. Not all of them need to happen and if one dominates it could happen. It is sort of like you get points for all the things that effect a maps success and if enough of them add up it becomes a paragon map. Currently I only see 3 paragon maps in HL2DM. Lockdown, Lostvillage, caverns. All of these maps have high points for the random factors that create such a map. What will surprise you from my old age I have learned that what gives maps high points is more lame then you think. <br>
<br>
1 they did not have utter crap fps. <br>
2 at some point an admin of a league blessed them and pushed them. <br>
3 some team played the living shit out of them non stop and forced every one they played against to play them in it. <br>
<br>
Through the second 2 factors people were forced to play these maps over and over till everyone knew them like the back of their hand and felt reasonably comfortable in them. The great part is none of those 3 maps are even great maps IMO there is nothing all that special about them. They were just sorta in the right place at the right time. And they didnt suck as bad as their competition. IE in the mapping contest there were very few entries and the competition for caverns was like LA which had no room for 4v4 and aftermath which was down right terrible. Plus the mapper I thought would work with us to improve caverns so I gave it my blessing and threw it in the playoffs the second season and Ewr forced every one to play them in it 24/7. Then the mapper turned out to not really give a shit all the success got to his head and he abondoned the map. Now we are stuck playing it with no sound for the rocket if you snd restart it looks like trash and has alot of glaring defects. <br>
<br>
Lost village is similar rhideon who was an admin at the time blessed it and tried to push it all the time. He had a crap computer and had some sort of HL1 connection so he had a huge bias toward HL1 maps. His clan cyn forced everyone to play LV 24/7. The map has jacked up secret doors what is it a bad killbox?, the mapper only made it because he wanted to see if it would compile in HL2 he didnt even give a shit about the map. There is alot of camping on random ledges. The map still looks exactly like a HL1 map. If no one had a preformed bias it would have been laughed out of competition. <br>
<br>
Then there is lockdown, back when the game started we had 2 shitty choices lockdown with only 2 paths from the bathroom, tons of junk physics and all sorts of ledges and walls that hang you up. Or there was overwatch. So most people gravitated toward the bad single player map port for competition. If you played $W and or you wanted to 1v1 most good player back then you had to do it on lockdown. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Some other random points. I was around when the game started and zeta prefinal was huge in pubs and plenty fun the rocket wasnt a big deal because all the spawn killing was outside and if you went out someone else took control. I dont think that matters anymore because there is no pub scene. Zeta worked great in pubs. Tig was not around though and avalon was big in pubs too. The bigger problem with these 2 maps was that no clan took them up as their map and forced everyone to play them. $W would play a variety of maps and that was sort of bad each time you played us you would get a variety as we tried to get people to play all sorts of good maps like amplitude, avalon, zeta, and many others and so in a way we eventually by trying to be more open led to the fall in popularity for lockdown. You see this with alot of proposed maps now a couple guys will push hard but there is not enough nor is there an admin to bless it. <br>
<br>
In fact you could say that valar suffers from the same problem by turning out to many maps all the time there is no large push toward any 1 map. And so he was unable to solidify 1 map in the game. <br>
<br>
There is also the fact that more people then not prefer maps to be simple. Be honest aim is trash but its simple plus VDuS played the crap out of it and you did not need much control to get kills every spawn is on a mag. People tend to be just pushing as much physics and anything that could get in the way out of maps. They tend to be spreading them out. Also vertical play seems to be unpopular. <br>
<br>
It is hard for a mapper to make a map thats great anyway because everyone has a different opinion. Me personally I want variety in maps. I think the perfect league would just have 8 very different maps play style wise. Each one would be heavy on a different weapon and so on. But the gravitation seems to be toward making all the maps fit the same bill. Milieu was an example I kinda thought the map brought a different playstyle to the table with its higher than normal concentration of health and armor.  Then the usual suspects get ahold of valar when I am busy and chop it all up so the weapon and armor is just like every other map out there and I totally lost all interest in the map after that.<br>
<br>
Also votes do not work because as seen in the past it ends up being all the same maps. The way it was in CU is the only truely fair way to do it. Any team picks any map there is no bias. But then you see what happens we have even less diversity than we had in CAL.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We did several votes and thats the way it went every damn time, without fail.    Many people did get fed up with this and left competative HL2DM as well as the game altogether.   Voting for maps doesnt solve anything.   <br>
<br>
Zeta and Avalon were played ALOT in pubs.  I had them running on my own pub.   They were both a ton of fun to play, particularly Avalon because of its vertical game play.  <br>
<br>
Valar, I appreciate your starting this thread, but I fear its the same old story and I doubt anything will change as much as I wish it would.  <br>
HL2DM was kept alive for so many years because of the variety and sheer countless number of maps out there.  It never got boring.  I used to love playing lots of maps and I played this game nearly every day for 5 years because every new map was a new world to explore and I loved every minute of it.  As was said, the stock pub scene is gone, dead. <br>
<br>
We clearly need new maps and the mappers to make them, but we also need pubs to play them and show them off in.  Without all of those the game will not grow again.   However if mappers have left the game because their maps dont get appreciated, we can hardly blame them. <br>
<br>
We have grappled with this issue off and on for a few years.   To be honest, I am not sure what the solution is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
we are responsible for our own downfall if this game goes to the retirement home.<br>
As gHOST clan in CU, we chose to use <span style="color:#40FF00">dm_helix</span>(boshed) for 3v3 and <span style="color:#FF4040">dm_hydroponicz</span>(pigpopper) for 2v2 and the amount of ppl who whine like a bitch cause they dont know the map is unjust. We wanted these maps because we as a clan gave them a chance. Now alot of clans are aware of these maps and pay more attention to them.<br>
<br>
Support our gods of dm and when these new maps come out in the beta tests, let their creator know your thoughts and they will listen to the gamer and adjust to suit.<br>

The truth is that all maps are flawed as fear pointed out and i agree with it completely. however, you have few remaining mappers still mapping for this game. use them. i hope the new league and competition will bring in new air and most importantly, that people will respond to them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There are a few reasons why people don't play HL2DM as much anymore,........the glitchy physics, the messed up hitreg(not consistant), and even because it's not fun anymore. Some people just get way too serious. <br>

I would like to see another league start up, I think it would be good for the community, and I think it could possibly bring back some more activity from members who may have stopped playing, like SIN. Seagull came back for CU, but was gone for a long time,....Who knows, could be a great idea.<br>

The thing about quakes is they dont have huge hitreg issues, and its actually easier to aim in them on the count of the player models are so fucking big on ur screen compared to hl2dm. Quakeplayers also dont have to aim for tiny heads. Then again if u dont have aim u can just spam physics and explosions =-P</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well Fearsome saved me alot of writing; most of what he said is pretty spot on. Also Valars example of "dm_old" made me lol (and its true, of course).<br>
<br>
The main problem ive noticed though, with respect to maps getting league level recognition, is the gap between mappers and players- specifically, most top league players have minimal to nonexistant mapping skills, and the most solid mappers dont play at a league level, inevitably leading to a great many good looking / performing maps that just dont hold up in high level scrims.<br>
<br>
And before someone mentions player feedback: Its often not enough. Once the recommended edits reach a certain threshold, it becomes a matter of either rebuilding the entire map from scratch (something few mappers are willing to do, unsurprisingly) or consigning it to the pub bin. The map needs to be build for a specific playstyle from the ground up, or get very lucky with a layout that can be molded into something competitive.<br>
<br>
Btw, Avalon was indeed a fun map with alot of promise; too bad the mapper insisted his final version was superior (it wasnt), and refused to work on or allow anyone else to work on the league-preferred b1.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Good times. <br>
<br>
That and I am really good a communicating  with mappers, even ones that speak English as a second language (abnok.) <br>
Also, if there was not a contest going on right now that was occupying Boshed's free-time, we would already have a rape-ass revision of dm_helix in its FINAL stage by now.    <br>

It can wait, and I really do think that he and vitaminG will have a spectacular map. (That is just my personal speculation.)<br>
Then when we would have only one good, new, map - we will rather have two. At least.<br>
Meh, maybe only one more besides boshed's two; I am not getting my hopes too high for this game's community.<br>
It could be four new-and-damn-good maps if I finished airfusion already.<br>
<br>
Still, this is a joke of a game. <br>
Unbalanced weapons + shitty, fetal physics engine = crappy and unprofessionally made game. <br>
Only thing marginally good was the movement system; even it was a bit too slow for what it should/could have been, but as we all know the bhop possibilities happened by accident.  <br>

	<div class="content">Fearsome is pretty spot on. There are plenty of really good maps that get ignored come league time. Some very old maps, that are as good as the rest and could still bring something fresh to the table, get overlooked because of timing and the lack of a popular clan backing it. A lot of it has to do with the fact that pubbing in hl2dm has gone to shit and pubbing is how many random clan players learn to love certain maps. There is no joy in playing a new map in a league for someone that hasnt played it much or hasnt had much time to learn the map and gets destroyed on it by the other team in league play. The map isnt going to be liked much by the team that gets killed on it. <br>
<br>
The older league maps that, didnt have a clan or admin (from a clan) pushing them, have stood the test of time because everyone knows them from pubbing and scrimming them in the days when players played this game for 2 to 10 hours every day and there were lots of noobatrons around. What would work best would be to have mappers fix up the older maps that have really small issues relating to competitive play and use those maps. Get a hold of the mapper that made them and fix the fuckers if they arent willing. That way, you have old maps that everyone remembers playing and knows really well and are fresh when it comes to league play. This game is really old and new maps just dont work like they did 4 years ago because they arent played enough. I really think a mapper for this game would spend his time better reworking older maps to better suit leagues then making new maps that no one is willing to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

V. true, for example look at how many popular maps are remakes from hldm - and they work simply because the gameplay is tried, tested and solid even with the differing movement.<br>

The idea is solid but the main problem (for me at least) is that a lot of the time the players themselves can't agree on what they want in a map, differing playstyles etc.<br>

Probably wouldnt be an easy task considering you cant find the original mappers for many of the maps, let alone get in touch with them and get their permission or rework a map.

	<div class="content">I guess your right on those few points but most of the deathmatch community are not people who play in the competitions (yes I know you said league maps, hear me on this). I really think that people should be more focused on making maps for normal servers. -&gt;<br>
This includes servers such as Jake's Fun House, The Senior Slayers and Freedom Fighter clan servers (also if you like Riddick's server in Aus now the Hamlet of Cryon). <br>
<br>
It would be interesting if someone actually make a map that is made for low gravity, and someone that creates the ultimate noob map. These would probably be played more than any other map that was specifically made for pro players. However Pro maps are usually played by regulars anyway.<br>
<br>
As for new maps being unfamiliar, I love exploring new maps and getting used to the new gameplay. Honestly Lockdown and maps like Lostarena are becoming a little boring.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

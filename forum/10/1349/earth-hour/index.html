	<div class="content">No. Im tired of seeing these silly drop-in-the-ocean responses to serious worldwide issues.<br>
<br>
The root cause of the vast majority of the worlds environmental problems stem from one simple thing: human overpopulation. There were under 1 billion people on the planet 50 years ago. Now were pushing what, 7 billion? If present growth continues, we are soon going to reach a point where no amount of resource management is going to make a noticeable difference... if we arent there already. Thats neverminding all the species and ecologies we destroy as we turn ever more wilderness into farmland / housing, try to drag more fish every year from the dwindling ocean stocks, mow down forests to dig up oil sands for the worlds exponentially increasing demand for crude, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
Its rather ironic that as unenvironmental a country as China may generally be, theyve had the jump on the rest of the world in this regard for a long time. Too bad its such a politically untouchable issue in democratic countries to suggest that someone NOT have 5+ kids... hopefully time and wisdom, or at least impending disaster, will change this before its too late.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Haven't any of you heard, we're fucked man, shits hitting the fan, we're right in the middle of the culmination to the apocalypse.  Better start hoarding your resources now, cause you aint getting shit from me, make your own fucking bomb shelter!  We are a two planet species its as simple as that.  We really need to get our act together and start colonizing other places in out solar system.  I'm all for managing resources but its too little to late, we need to find a new source and manage that one from the start, cause humans aint gonna stop fuckin anytime soon.  Theres probly a million people fuckin right now as I type this.  <br>
<br>
Or we should develope a requirement for being let into society, like an IQ minimum requirment.  You must have an IQ of over 80 or you are deamed a burden on society and are emediately terminated, sterilized, and processed into soilent green.  Ahh yes the solution to overpopulation, world hunger, and the decline in education.  Not only would we be solving all of our problems we'd be strebgthening the gene pool at the same time.

Already done brother.  Every which way I look at the world progressing onwards to a common goal (intellectualism-better resources), I imagine a near extinction..  It's just got to happen..  Most of the wealthy people can't get past the fact that the REAL wealthy people don't give a shit about them, sorry to say, but even a revolt (we fucking need to) sounds unachievable to me at this point, because the illusion of safety doesn't even keep people on their toes anymore.  <br>
<br>
'We' as LIFE (majority), have chosen desire and greed over actual civilization, we are experiencing the calm before the calm of the storm, but who knows..  Maybe when the storm's over someone will get it through their skulls that everything we WERE doing WASN'T doing ANYTHING (and this will be dipicted as a nice sparkling rainbow..), a bit of me doubts it though.  The greedy people in power are the people who write history, it's one huge joke to me anymore.<br>

	<div class="content">Well it's a whole End Of Days scare going around just like the whole 1999 Dec 31st, rather that's what it's become.  The more I read about Mayan civilization the more I see just the ending of a cycle (for a reason)..  The common <strong class="text-strong">B</strong> of the <strong class="text-strong">A</strong>..  Also, they could predict the future by recognizing the past, keeping records of the skies, etc.  All 2012 (I hate our calender, there is alot of debate on whether or not this is the correct conversion.) is, is the sun's ecliptic plane traversing into the milky-way's equatorial plane, moreover on the winters solstice, this is what is known as "The Sacred Tree" to the Mayans, there's alot of talk going around about unthinkable destruction and collision, climate change etc, but I'll be the first to say to open your eyes, there's destruction everywhere, 'illusion of safety'  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
We are just miles away from immense destruction, our atmosphere is the lock on your door..  Slowly but surely, they are drilling into it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
It's coincidence that USA's plans are happening around this time, but the more you hear about the world ending, the more you're prone to believe it I guess..  <br>
<br>
I'll end with: Shouldn't we all be thinking about the future of things?

Yes its the end of the Mayan calendar but I believe its not a 'oh shit we're going to die' thing but more of a end of the world as we know it (and I feel fine) type of thing.<br>
Mass stock market crash is what comes to mind. Maybe someone sets off an EMP and knocks out Wall St.<br>

Mayan calander-southa america, E Ching-china, that new internet prophet thing, and certain descriptions in the biblae about signs of the apocalypse coming lining up with current events.  I can't remember but I think th Koran might have also said alittle something about it.  I heard all of this on a history channel show a while ago so don't hold me too this.  I just know they mentioned at least 5 different documents/things in different cultures that talk about 2012 being a very signifigant year.  I find it kinda weird that ALL of these things are pointing to the same year, even if it were the same decade it would be a little weird.  But I agree, I think the extent of what happens is gonna be a "Its the end of the world as we know it, and i feel fiiiiiiinnnneee." type of deal. (great song lol)  I would be kinda pissed though if everything fell into chaos and society collapsed...no more internet gaming, no more internet porn, no more power or utilites...no more gaming period.  Might as well just roll over and die.  Or start a gang/millitia and try to claim as much teritory and resources as you have the firepower to defend.

Yeah we'll all do better than the adverage joe if it comes to all out fighting for survival.  Its been proven that people who play fps games like CS, hl2dm, cod4, americas army, are more apt to perform well in a combat situation.  I'm not sure of the real scientific reasons for this but I would assume its because those situations would be more natural to us.  Our brains are constantly processing "tactical information" while we are playing these games in order to make the best choices for the given situation.  When I say tactical information I am trying to refer to all the data we observe in-game to determine our next action.  What it comes down to is we are more likey to make sound decisions that will keep us alive, than the average non-fps playing joe.  That reasoning is the whole reason behind the Amry deveolping Americas Army.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I am all for environmental protection. But I did not like this whole earth hour thing. Saw tons of paper fliers around campus, calculates the death of trees thanks to earth hour. The problem I see with it is that a bunch of people want to feel like they are doing something so they take one measly hour and turn things off. Great but what about the other 365 days of the year? If you want to personally help the environment you need to make a long term commitment to consuming less. Not just say I am going to tough it out for an hour then go back to consuming as usual. <br>

Also people seem to be all into fads now days. I remember the 90s it was all about saving trees and recycling. Where did that go? now everyone talks constantly about global warming but they don't even care that in the last 10 years the quality of products has gone to shit and it's all made in China and consumes a whole shit load of fuel to come over here in a boat. And then when you get it its such a hunk of shit it only last 1 year then you throw it out and have to buy another one. I wonder if anyone even bothers to notice that everyone forgot about filling the land fills completely and they now fill them at a faster rate then ever. Currently I am looking for a grill and I am noticing something really sad about reviews. Many people buy the same brand and a similar priced item after an older grill wears out after 5 years and the next one only lasts them 1-2 years. About 6 years ago I bought a pair of shoes I likes. I still have them today. less then 2 years ago I bought the same exact shoe again from the same exact company I liked it so much. The newer one wore out completely through the sole in less then 2 years. I am now wearing the older one again and threw out the newer one. <br>
<br>
Basically if you care about the environment you have to work on reducing your consumption in all areas every day. Not just 1 hour once a year. And many times you need to make decisions to not have something or purchase less because you bought a higher quality item that would last longer. We live in a society where nearly everyone can have a computer and our waste especially paper waste should be falling like crazy but it seems we just keep consuming more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i too think this Let's shut down the lights and be kewl for an hour is pathetic and, even though came from good intentions is completely acting as a self spin of public opinion...lol...ppl should be looking at what the big cheese of this world is doing. talk about the route of all evil. but yeah...guess ppl are too busy shopping and "mind their own business" = HA!. ...most ppl IMO do ANYTHING BUT mind THEIR OWN BUSINESS.<br>

Those notes about the Mayan calendar predictions are completely off base..those predictions were first noted to hit 1987, then nothing happened..so someone then claimed ahh no it's all going down in 1999, yeah that's it. 1999 came along and nothing happens. snap!...so hmm..maybe the turn of the century? anyone? ahw...no nothing still.. well,..then, we heard ppl saying the Maya meant 2001, then 2002...uh oh...something is wrong and we're alive oh god! heh...and let'e not forget Nostradamus, and the Hopi Prophecy..they come in all shapes and sizes.<br>
while reading through many ancient Hebrew and early christian manuscripts i've seen a lot of this in there too...my perosnal take is this and sorry in advance if i'm offending anyone's beliefs here... for me these are all Spins. nothing more. nothing less. people of power, priests, bankers and politicians always had their reasons for keeping the masses in fear of the End of Time, the "Judgment Day". it's all crap and keeps us behaving better, spending more and them better fed and their positions better kept.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

</div></blockquote>  Hehehe your silly, without such an abundance of people our pollution would be greatly reduced, and so would our need to cut down the rain forest.  Supply and demand my friend, the more people we have the higher the demands are for consumer products,  resulting in a high demand on refining of resources and manufacture of said products.  <br>
What do both of these proccess produce an a bundance of, waste and pollutants, what are used in many manufacturing proccesses, toxic/nauctious chemicals (pollutants).  Seems pretty logial, the more people we have on this planet, the more pollutants and waste we are going to create.  You may not have meant to say it as you did, but to say "there are <span style="text-decoration:underline">far too many unpopulated areas</span>(are you serious!?) on this earth to warrant such a claim."  Our current population growth when plotted on a graph, has assumed a nearly exponential acceleration curve, if thats not alarming I want some of what your smoking  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">  It might be because I'm a nature buff or the fact that I was raised in a old-hippie charged atmosphere growing up in a small town in Vermont, but I find this statement to be utterly alarming.  I can't even percieve how you could come to such a conclusion lol.  Nothing wrong with it, I'm just blown away, its interesting how two people can come to such opposite conslusions.

I did mean everything i wrote content and spelling. this is my opinion. (post softening smile icon)<br>
<br>
My opinion is that cutting down rain forests is not a must and there are other options..other types of fuel available to us. the current one is a known hazard = oil. mining it has a proven negative effect on earth and chopping down trees has a proven negative effect on earth. The Human population being by definition part of earth share this effect and cannot escape it. Supply and demand rules can be met otherwise: it has been suggested at the beginning of the last century to move to using Cannabis as fuel and that resulted in oil tycoons having Cannabis banned altogether. digging just a bit deeper will show you more and more as you go... <br>
Overpopulation is relative to space. i believe there is an agenda behind this statement.<br>
There are indeed unpopulated areas on earth and yes i am being very serious.(post softening smile icon)<br>
Looking for a new planet is a strange idea imo...do we really expect that new planet to be "inhabit ready".  we do have a lot of areas we CHOOSE not to inhabit but i think we should.<br>

	<div class="content">There is evidence that things are changing on a global scale.  Some people (I was once one of them) dont want to believe that global warming is happening because in their very small area of the world, they had a rather harsh winter or a colder than normal spring/summer.  For example, Michigan has had a very very harsh winter with a lot of snow.  Likewise upstate NY (not all that unusual for them tho).  However, Long Island, NY (not that far away) has had a very very mild winter.  Barely 6 inches of snow this winter where I live.  Temperatures were not that cold for very long.  You cant look at a small piece of the puzzle (ie your own little world) and make an accurate statement on what is happening on a global scale.<br>
<br>
Fact: the glaciers are melting some areas that were covered with ice 3-4 decades ago are now green with grass.<br>
Fact: Sea level is rising as a result<br>
Fact: Average sea surface temperatures are rising<br>
Fact: Ocean species are being effected by the warming of the oceans.  Tropical species are expanding their range north, northern species' ranges are being pushed further north<br>
Fact: Trees in temperate areas (studies have been done in NY and elsewhere) are showing the effects of the rise in average temperature<br>
Fact: Warming is effecting crops cycles<br>

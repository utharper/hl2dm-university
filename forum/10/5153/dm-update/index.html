"Was reading my rss feeds and saw one from Steam, they usually don't publish stuff... "Counter-Strike: Source Update Released".<br>
<br>
Checked out the article and i think they updated it to make use of the engine used on their newest games... fixing some other things and adding achievements and stuff<br>
<br>
And apparently they are porting hl2dm too<br>

Yeah but if they chose to use the new engine bunnyhop will get taken out.

The very first post the guy states: "Given that HL2 and DM are the same engine, why wasn't Deathmatch brought over? Is it to keep us jonesing for TF2?"<br>
<br>
Meaning that HL2 was brought over to the new engine, why wasnt DM?<br>
<br>
The VALVE admin replies with this "There are only so many hours in the day, we are working on it."<br>
<br>
Which hints to "HL2DM will be moved over to the new engine, but we are taking our sweet ass time like always, and it will probably be fucked even moar so bye hl2dm competitive community, all we will have left for you is rp and servers with no bunnyhop." (:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Really, he doesn't mention updates. Only that hl2dm isn't playable in mac yet.<br>
When he talks about HL2 and HL2dm being the same engine, he is just assuming HL2dm would logicaly be ported along with it. I kind of understand his point, tho it's kind of a misconception of his.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Exactly. It's about what they are doing. They are listening to anti-bhop-cry-babies ever since CS, and all other games of theirs have bhop practicaly or completely made impossible. And for several reasons you can see that it was intended.<br>
<br>
Any valve engine can have bhop, even TF2 engine version. Actualy you can bhop in TF2 with a slight advantage, but it's almost futile. But in TF2C mod you can play in an even more exagerated way as in AG2 in Pro mode.<br>
<br>
The question is, like Valar sais, who will they hear?<br>
<br>
Boshed told me a story about a green land named HL1, where everyone was happily bhopping around, untill one day when Valve monster came in and broke bhop. And despite all the pleas and cries the monster grinned all his cruelty and said "it was intentional". Then AG1 came and saved the day, but the damage was done anyway, and the ones that remained in the original scene were the cry-babies. Eventualy the game died, I guess.<br>
<br>
I just hope this story doesn't have an episode 2...<br>
So I actualy second what Valar said, we probably should all be trying something, anything, whatever is at our grasp to make it noticeable to Valve that this game should stay as is, in what gameplay is concerned.<br>

I do get the picture Valar, been all over those forums and made many many posts against those noobs.  I have read and heard all of their arguements a multitude of times.   Your concern regarding the noobed down trend in gaming is a valid one.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: Valve is going to do whatever they think will sell games and make them money.  The question is whether they think they can justify someones time and salary for this game.  We all know they have done oh so much in support of HL2DM in recent YEARS...... (*Sarcasm Alert*)<br>

I'm sorry keefy you keep posting about AG2 but if it was only so simple something about that mod just doesn't entice us into playing it apparently if it was so great other players would simply have moved over to it and it may have grabbed valves attention and been added to there Mod list but simply theres something that makes us not want to play it. maybe its the over complication of the UI's since theres 4-5 of them with 3-4 sub menus</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It IS that great. I just don't play it more cuz there's very few people playing it more. It already has a few sponsored Regular DM (locked) servers and I suggested some dm_ maps to janek to complete them (cuz pg_ maps for regular mode suck). I also thought about suggesting to Janek the removal of those lame bots from these servers... they ruin them a bit too much. There's also a slight diference in air control atm.<br>
<br>
But most people either don't know how improved it is or are stubborn enough to not want to play mods, or to wait forever for a fixed HL2dm. While I'd love to play a fixed HL2md, I still wouldn't mind at all playing AG2. The times I played it it was so sweet and I felt so free of bugs and my mind focused on the actual game instead of the bugged encumbrance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's true. I tested this on the Starwars Map servers. If a guy was standing still, I'd snipe him, if my crosshair was Right on his head it wouldn't always register. But a little bit up, and to the left of the head registered a Headshot everytime. And most of the time that ends up being how I get my headshots close up too. When a person is moving the hitbox also kind of follows behind a person, so if you shoot just behind them where their head would be, it'll register a headshot. The hitbox is not always locked onto the target, it is always a little behind when a person is moving.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

neither of those are client side its all on the server Valve has clearly stated this many times they make it server oriented so that theres more of a discouragement to cheat though totally useless, games like quake do have it client side though if irc thats why in this game it varies from server to server Documentation here:<a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization#Lag_Compensation" class="postlink">http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki ... mpensation</a> also I have no loss hardly ever any choke and I have to dart around constantly on some ppl to actually hit there head sometimes it will be to the left other times it will be to the right while this game determines everything in the past quake determines things to where it will be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yes, you are right. But it's not regularily. The source engine is just fucked up. <br>
There are videos on youtube showing the Source Engine 1 hitboxes as they move with the models. The are never right on the model. Standing still yes,...but when a person is moving, the hitbox is often close behind the model. Not right on the model like most people would assume. <br>
You are right about the rates actually, they have minimal effect. Most servers are 100/100 but some lock you to 66/66. <br>
In most cases 100 tick doesn't work too well for servers with Lifts, or other moving parts. And if you use 100 tick in a starwars server, you can't glide, and it's super choppy on the runway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Exactly. This is what I was talking about. Before the CSS update, CSS was even worse. The hitboxes were horrible. But DM has the same issue. <br>

At least double.<br>

Source engine assumes that whatever you set your RATE to is your absolute maximum download rate so knocks of  between 5000-10000  so 30000 becomes 20000 <br>

Any engine has anything the coders want it to have. And OB has bhop, if Valve wants to.<br>
<br>
Why not Source Engine 2? Take a good look at things: They took a shit on this game so long ago, and are still taking a shit on it regularly. It's price is one, the limited offer that has no limit is another, ignoring players is another. This is like their freeakin toylet. They are only updating it, IF they are, cuz they need to in order to port it to Macs. Otherwise, do you rly think they would even care about it's engine in the 1st place?<br>
<br>
Lets hope they do care abit more than they have shown in the past. If not for their own game, at least for the people who love it...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, it's a fact.<br>
<br>
Then again marky, it's a very childish argument you used there. The people one plays agaisnt has no relation to a person's knowledge or whatever.<br>
Don't take everything people say seriously. Pernicious might not be into offending you, but rather making a joke about it. We all know that text doesn't always carry out our face expression or mood while typing it. <br>

In a lan setting, having your xhair on the enemy at any distance and pressing m1 with the mag out is a hit 100% of the time. Online its definitely not 100%, maybe close if everyones pings are low and everyones got clean net, likely alot less with all the $1/slot toaster mac servers people like to rent, high pings, wireless routers, jacked rates etc that are all so common.<br>

Well, in real life, apparently my hit reg is perfect. I do a lot of headshots to my neighbors, strafing or not, as it seems to be working pretty well. Dunno what's my life's rates or my life's server tick, but I seem to not suffer any choke either.<br>
<br>
The only thing that's not working so well is spawn points. Dunno what's wrong but I don't see any of them respawning.<br>
So I think my life definitely needs an update.<br>

<br>

best of any source game? ...is Source the only engine you play games on? ...You're missing out. HL2DM is one many great FPS's. But the ONLY one in Source. <br>
UT3, and Quake Live have better hitreg, and although the movement is different, the gameplay is probably better. <br>
You notice that these other 2 games have more players than DM does? sad but true.<br>
Hitboxes in HL2DM move when you move, and are slower than you are. When you move, your hitbox is close behind you. It's never fixed on you. Which is why if I player is moving, shoot close behind him.... If a player is strafing back and forth, you don't aim on the model, you aim just off of him, and there you go. The hitboxes in DM are not as good as the hitboxes in UT3, and QL. <br>
In those other games, you have to get used to actually aiming AT the model, not next to it. <br>
If you think I don't know what I'm saying, you must be a big noob. There's plenty of demonstrations you can watch to show how the hitboxes in the Source engine work. I suggest you watch a few of them. Aiming directly at a model in the source engine 1 only works a small percentage of the time.<br>
<br>
Of course server rates, and player rates have something to do with this, but it's not the main problem. It's the engine itself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It is a well established phenomenon that internet lag can cause communications errors with the server where on your computer you see that you hit someone but the server is also communicating with the computer of the guy you shot at and his computer says he moved 2 feet to the right before your bullet hit them. Having played a few online multiplayer games, I have seen this happen in all of them.  Some days, on some servers it is so bad as to cause video glitching and rubber banding issues.  It can change depending on where you are connecting to.   I have had a bad connection to a server in Texas where I was lagging all over the place and on the same day play on a Euro server with no problems at all.

the hitreg is not really the issue. The issue is the netcode for dm. It's atrocious.  Fix the netcode and the hitreg will improve. You have to remember that dm was coded by like one dude from valve in his spare time lol. The code itself is a nightmare. Updating to the OB engine is a gift from god for this game in terms of coding.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im willing to bet that if they put hl2dm on the OB engine, it will be rebuilt from the ground up and they are going to have to put bhop in the game. It will be interesting to see what they end up doing cause they dont care about anyone's opinion on this forum. The last few years Valve has had a pretty strick idea on allowing movement that they cant really control. This is the reason they have removed the engine's bhop bug from pretty much every game they have released in quite awhile. I dont really care which way they go as I can play this game with or without bhopping, but Im very interested to see how this all turns out and what way they actually decide to go.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So much so that ppl would not use that weapon at all, everyone including a mate from hl2dm who was playing also were just using explosive weapons like the rocket and flack/blobs etc.<br>
UT3 has no anti lag, or just bad anti lag, sometimes wen i shot it would be immediate, but mostly it seemed to delay the shot depending on my ping. Sucked hardcore nutsuck.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes I have a really bad feeling that it'll be left out. The guy to talk to on the subject would be subzero just to see how much effort he had to put into getting the bhop in his OB mod to match that of the current dm code. If it takes any bit of time, I suspect Valve will just leave it out. They will have to physically add it back in which makes the odds even worse. They are really stupid though if you ask me. Valve should actually spend some time on this game, adding a few gamemodes along with it considering the code is already set up for it and rebadge it and resell it for 20$ a pop. That will at least lower the hacking a bit. Any player that actually likes this game would think twice about getting caught via VAC when they would have to fork over another 20 or 30 a pop just to play dm again. This free/5$ crap was a big turd for this game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Oh, and marky, that remark about UT3 having better netcode/reg confused me. I played it a bit recently, updates and all, and it was horrid, the shots for the pulse gun thingy delayed, went through ppl often....It was the buggiest peice of shit i have ever seen for netcode. So much so that ppl would not use that weapon at all, everyone including a mate from hl2dm who was playing also were just using explosive weapons like the rocket and flack/blobs etc.<br>
UT3 has no anti lag, or just bad anti lag, sometimes wen i shot it would be immediate, but mostly it seemed to delay the shot depending on my ping. Sucked hardcore nutsuck.</div></blockquote>

Yes, As said earlier, sometimes it depends where you are connecting from, and other issues are involved as well. I haven't played it in ages, but the last time I did, I didn't seem to notice any issues. I guess even the GPU you have can have an impact on these things........Like Zeik, saying he get's 11-23 FPS. I don't know how that's possible, but apparently he does.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

And marky, the biggest problem about OB's bhop is that it doesn't actualy work like CSS's in any way.

More likely any difference people notice is a updated engine like orange box or the speed of players movement. <br>
<br>
Also as for bunny hopping. Valve said during FIOS it was intended however I am pretty sure that was because at the time they were listening to league players and they were just to lazy to fix it. If valve does anything with bunny hopping it will probably an accident, the code will just get ported and no sentient decision would have been made.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dont think the netcode is something you just turn on and off as fearsome tried to explain. There is a lot more to it and dm's is shit compared to pretty much every other source game that Valve spent time on. Just go check out how smooth CSS is compared to dm. One way to really notice is to try playing css with a ping of 150 and then trying to play dm with a ping of 150. It is night and day in comparison. Dm's netcode is based off the source engine's basic netcode without any adjustments, whereas any game that Valve has actually spent some time on has much improved netcode. They obviously learned quite a bit about how shitty it was from the get go since the OB's netcode was updated and is by far superior.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

All that crap you are talking about adds more lag which im sure plays a factor as well, but it still doesnt change the fact that dm's netcode and overall coding is shit compared to anything else they have released related to the source engine.

I totally agree there. That dude that was aimbotting yesterday just owned anyone by looking at them - like you said their crosshair snapped to their head, even around corners.<br>
<br>
I tried telling Riddick (owner of a major aus server) that people CAN hack in his server and his is one of the most protected, but still not protected from .lua scripts. Not even sv_pure is set so then people can make an invisible texture and replace it in their own materials folder to wallhack ligit.<br>
<br>
But I was just looking at the orangebox compared to the current source engine. I believe it would do wonders for this game because it LOOKS so much better. A lot of people decide how great a game is on its graphics, many unnamed's leave after an hour of playing it which is kinda sad because we do need more players in this game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm really adicted to games, but if they beg me for an upgrade on my PC I simply don't play them. I'm not stupidly wasting money just because gaming companies are all happy improving cosmetics (and not much else).<br>

Old games &gt; Recent games<br>
<br>
And btw, my PC can handle L4D2, COD Waw and MW2 almost maxed out. But my aim isn't as accurate and fast as in hl2dm or quake 3/live.<br>
And for a multiplayer shooter you're aiming for more fps than the server tick. Which isn't the case in most these games for most people.<br>
But of course, people don't know and then they think the other players are cheaters because they don't die due to poor hit reg and stuff like that. And this really helps making the internet a friendly place...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

And I'm really needing refreshing games, new stuff, diferent stuff. I'm sick of stereotypes and trendy games. Doom 3 did disgust me too. I mean, compared to quake 1 it only has better graphics. Not much else. This is 2010 and games are still stagnated like fuck imho. I play games for over 20 years, I really don't loose anymore time and money in games that still feel like quake 1.<br>
<br>
It feels like playing the same game over and over, with diferent maps and diferent weapons and 1 or 2 new features that felt like a lame excuse for making it. It's like watching Arnold Schwartzenegger's Commando movie and go watch Rambo next. I loved commando when I was a kid, but damn I can't watch that movie forever. But besides, Crysis doesn't really fit in my personal aproval for being so freaking heavy. I also don't buy games that aren't really made with care. <br>
<br>
Call of Juarez series, Penumbra series and some other, were the very few games that actualy made me feel happy lately.<br>
<br>
And yes, I'm a stubborn person who only contributes to what I believe in, and I don't believe in most of these games, and I'm starting to desbelieve in valve too.<br>
Like in music and movies, there's something in each game that makes me feel if it was made from the heart or if it was made for numbers. I usualy let my heart decide what's worth my money and what's not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, there's your problem: you watched videos of it.  The people on youtube make that game look very boring.  The fun comes in when you use all your suit powers together and just do dumb shit with it.  Sure you can just sneak around in armor mode the whole game or you can use all the powers together and make cool shit happen.  I thought the voice acting for the human enemies was hilarious too.<br>

Oblivion disappointed me right from the start. Cliché story, theatrical voice acting by the king, etc. I really tried to like that game, i played it for months, but I ended up noticing that most of the time I was feeling more frustrated and wrathful at it's lack of sense, than entertained and rewarded, I just uninstalled it for good.<br>

It can be ok in certain situations, the vision I had was an forest dividing the two ctf bases that would be some bunkers or something like that.

Awesome<br>
<br>
@Arguementalizer:  Grats man.  Glad to hear things are looking up for you.<br>
<br>
@ Skrauts:  Not sure what you are expecting to be new in a FPS game.   Crysis was considered innovative because of its dynamic graphics which is why it got a high meta score.   They were able to have wind effects on foliage with incredible detail.  Multiplayer was pretty awesome to play simply because of the huge yet finely detailed maps.  Honestly you were disappointed in Bioshock!   The game got so many accolades its rediculous.  Doom3 was kind creepy especially with its sound effects but I think I liked it better than the Quake 4 single player better because Q4 got a bit repetative after a while.   Seems like you dont really like games anymore TBH.  <br>
<br>
As with movies it gets to the point where its very difficult to come out with a totally original storyline for new games, which is why we see very similar storylines in games.  With advances in technology, the only real way to make games better is with more detailed and better graphics.  They are finding new ways to use physics in games.  The other problem is that games are so expensive to make that game companies oftern arent so willing to risk coming out with something completely new and and tend to go with what they know (or think) will sell and make money.  It is unfortunate.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">@ Paradox, what you say is true indeed. But I still love games. <br>
<br>
To try and make my point better to understand, look at it this way: When you got a basket full of oranges you will not say they are great because they are big and their skin looks soft and clean, but rather because they are juicy and have a sweet taste.<br>
Now, most games are only advancing into the clean and shinny skin orange, without becoming juicyer or sweeter. All of what you said about Crysis is a great example of it. The game didn't get a good score for being a good game, but rather for being a good tech demo. And I love games, not tech demos. They don't make me think 60€ (75.2USD) are worth investing in. But on the contrary to oranges, that you will buy them elsewhere if they suck, games will still be bought because they are shinny (definitely not by me tho).<br>
<br>
I don't believe in that common resignation that people tend to fall in, like you said "its very difficult to come out with a totally original storyline for new games". The human mind and imagination is infinite and there's always plenty of things to be invented, discovered, imagined. And there's still examples of that everyday, everywhere. You can see that especialy in indie games. It's true that the risk vs reward for big companies is big, but they tend to let themselves be ruled by this monster called "trends" that often leads them in wrong directions. For exemple, during years the US companies thought (and may still think, not sure) that games set in a Western scenery wouldn't sell overseas. This is what they thought. But the European companies themselves have been proving this to be wrong by creating several Western games along the years, Desperados, Wanted Dead or Alive (Wanted Guns in EU), Call of Juarez (and more perhaps, we do love Westerns).<br>
<br>
And then the advertising itself leads consumers to make this even more dificult to predict. They advertise every cosmetic and physics advancements in such a way that people are focusing on that and this has created a hipe on people that is leading it the wrong direction, like an Unreal professional mapper said "it's easier to sell a great outdoors environment than it is to sell a good storyline". People, somehow, only seem to want HDR and Motion Blur and Dx11 and Bullet physics and all those secondary things that don't necessarily makes games fun. To be honest I'm not having as much fun with newer games as I still have with old games nowadays. If you take all that away from crysis and you'll end up with a pretty much empty ga... something.<br>
<br>
That same UT mapper predicted a great turn around in games industry in a near future, I hope he's right.<br>
(I'll post a link to this UT mapper's enterview if I find it again)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
There are alot of people who will chose the colorful orange over the tastier one. But instead of crying the makers of the tasty orange should engineer it to be colorful too. Think about sports cars sure you can make it go fast and handle great but if it does not look good few people are going to drop 100k on it and that will punish your customers as they will being paying higher prices for the lower volume you produce.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

(Assassin's Creed and Oblivion are two good examples)<br>
<br>
Look at Final Fantasy 7. It's the perfect example of a game that sold millions, the "whole world" loved it, but the character models are some of the most horrible looking things ever. Now, I don't see a lot of people ever mentioning that it sucked because of that. What I see is everyone saying that FF7 was epic and maybe one of the best games ever.<br>
<br>
But when people look at games now, if it doesn't support HDR, sucks, if it doesn't have a very complicated physics system, sucks, if it doesn't have a.... I forget its name... realisticly moving plants, sucks,... and who is considering the storyline? The environment's effort to immerse players? The diversity? The coherency of some logical things (see what I said about doom 3 some posts back)? etc<br>
<br>
I saw in the steam forums a thread called HL2 vs Bioshock, and despite HL2 has a much more diverse environment full of life and events and full of sense and full of details and full of action, some people still called it a tech demo, because of what I just said before. And despite Bioshock beeing repetitive, having a pretty lonely environments, being a bit of sam&amp;max in a diferent set for the most part, the same people said it was genius and it had all of what I said about HL2.<br>
<br>
Bioshock isn't the worst game in all the recent games, nor it's the best, but, honestly, there's something really wrong here.<br>

Yes, you cant with all of the EP2's VMT intact, but altering the VMT's and the VTF's allows for it to be ported over. Trust me here, I have already cut out portions of hl2ep2 single player maps and tested them in hl2dm as it is now. They can and will work, you just have to do a few things. Now, there are some textures and models that I couldnt get to work, but 90% of them are working. There are obviously things that dont work in hl2dm that is in ep2 maps because of the different engines, but I have about 90% of all the models and textures from ep2 transferred over and able to be used at my disposal for hl2dm lol. <br>
<br>
The screenshot is from the map ctf_canyon that I reworked for the hl2:ctf mod and its for the version that is still not released yet <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">. A lot of that stuff isnt from ep2, but if you look at the skybox, its all from ep2 along with the skybox radio tower that is in white forest of ep2. The cliff textures on the rock walls are also from ep2 as well as the bottom white brick walls which are from the white forest facility. And the map is being ran on a version of the source engine that is pre hl2:ep1.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Valve have had many opportunities to remove this bug, if they wanted to they would have changed it in the 2006 update or the 2008 update. <br>
In fact the way they removed it in the new engine was to multiply the potencial vecolity of a forward strafe jump by -1 when you attempt to bunny forward. This means you gain no speed etc.. If you try it backwards in the new engine code you accelerate twice as much in reverse, meaning its still there. This means the way they have it coded out should be easy to turn off. Hopefully means its likely to be console command.<br>
If they werent gonna keep it they would have taken it out completely like in tf2 or portal.</div></blockquote>

It's true indeed that strafe jumping backwards in HL2 is possible and results in a greater jump and speed than it did before.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I doubt that developers changing it over can fix every exploit that an eagled-eyed player could find. Even if they do remove the bunnyhopping technique used atm, another will be found eventually. <br>

Actually I think that is a brilliant idea, however like above said, noobs will still join the servers where bhop is allowed, just as they will join a server that does not. But the nubs shouldn't have any complaints about bhoppers then, because they could just find a server where bhop isn't allowed. <br>
Also probably this will make less people rage quti in the first few days of playing the game.

	<div class="content">There would probably be 2 or 3 pubs that allowed it and the rest wouldnt, pretty much like it is now.  I dont see a need for an option, the server admins will set the rules and determine what type of game play is on their server.  Personally I dont want to see an option because if this game ever does get new blood, as often happens, they start out not knowing about Bhop then they get exposed to someone that does know.  If they havent already been brainwashed by the "its a hax" crowd and they have an open mind they usually start trying to find out and learn it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">chickenmobile, the newcommers will always ragequit eventualy in any server. I seen non-bhoppers (that didn't even use the jump key so often) having such a great aim that took advantage of all the other players being such easy targets to totaly pwn them, thus making them ragequit after calling them cheaters, hackers and all the other names in the book. In HL2dm it's too easy to hit the head of someone who barely even sprints, and possibly stand still or crouch while shooting at you, which is the case for most new players.<br>
<br>
Again, it would be probly a good thing if the game had an option for bhop, so that people would start thinking if they learn a few movememnt tricks hey might become harder targets.<br>
<br>
But anyway, in the event of having such option, Valve would have to make it noticeable and would have to make something in this game like ID made with Quake live: Training levels. That's the only way people will ever notice from the start that theres a movement skill available to everyone. Valve is doing this in TF2, they already have a training course for one of the classes. But I dunno, seeing how they underrate HL2dm so far, I dunno how much they would ever care for any of this. Tbh I sense they'll upgrade the engine, probably keep bhop, but then they'll probably move on, and the only fixed thing we'll have is probably crashes. I doubt they'll even try to make demos compatible...<br>
<br>
And paradox, I dunno for sure, but I think the only reason why there's not more servers that block bhop is because the ways to do it are not so apparent. Not everyone knows, or it doesn't occur to everyone, that raising gravity to 800, or lowering airaccelerate can prevent bhop. And even knowing it, many people may still prefer to play the default settings and take risks of encountering bhoppers than to play with such weirdo settings.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol?  There is no way to "block" it or turn it off in the server settings, you can only make it difficult to do.   What are you calling "default settings"?  Default is 600 grav and air accel 10.  Most servers these days play at NON default settings.  Most (leaving out coop and role play servers) are low grav, less than 400 grav, high air accel, etc.  Almost EVERY server blocks Bhop these days and the biggest reason is because the ways to do it are not apparent and its hard to learn.  There is either a rule against it on stock/default setting servers or they lower the grav (not raise it) to 400 or less.  They dont give a crap about the "its available to everyone" arguement.  Ive made that arguement myself and offered to teach it 100s of times. They just say "If I cant just push one button to do it and I have to learn some complex combination of moves then its not a fair thing to do because it gives you an advantage over everyone else"<br>
<br>
In any case if there is an option to shut off the ability to do it in the game, you are going to see most pub servers with that option on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Of course it doesn't block your bhop, but you'll see what I mean.<br>

Don't take it all so literaly.  I'm just saying that people do rly weird stuff to the settings to have it as much off as they can.<br>
<br>
I saw a server once, in which they had a map called madme or something, and they had the server set to waste your AUX while you where in the air, so you could bhop, but when you stoped you had no aux at all and had to wait a bit to make another strafe jump and other stuff I can't remember. It was rly annoying to try to bhop in that server. And it wasted you aux in around 2 secs btw.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what it means is at least in the case of CS:S, TF2 and DOD:S they're added a new feature where bunnyhoping is available through a server cvar.<br>
so in effect, servers are loaded with sv_enablebunnyhopping 0 the server admin can set it to sv_enablebunnyhopping 1 in their server.cfg opening bunnyhoping on that server.<br>
They've clearly implemented this because the larger majority of players aren't favoring bhop and they still wanted to allow this for other who do want it. so that's the solution they're come up with and i think it's excellent. reading into this shows not that Valve not only listens to the community but also does its best to cater for everyone's tastes.<br>

That's because it was only done on CSS. The other 2 do not have that cvar available. Basically, they are saying the community for CSS requested it and the other 2 have not.

lolwut? Even in bronze league in TFC, learning to rocket jump was STANDARD along with bunnhyop. Silver league is when it was standard to not even miss a step in bunnyhop. Its a disgrace like new kid soccer leagues popping up everywhere where there is no winner or loser, looks like our former societal belief of no holds barred competitive darwinist spirit is dying both in society and in games.<br>
<br>
Recoil too hard in CounterStrike for idiots to handle? NP we'll nerf recoil in COD games. Bunnyhop too hard to consistently use for idiots? NP well take it out. People who suck at games in their first months or so in servers causing them to go away? NP we'll make some rewards for people who consistenly die. All in the name of pleasing idiots for money.<br>

Thanks for proving my point.  No where near the skill level or speed of TFC.  Then again, you were like 3 when TFC was out, and you're part of the HALO generation, so you wouldn't understand anyway.  <br>

The game is slower, dumbed down, takes less skill in general so it can make idiots who cant handle learning curves feel better about themselves. If you'd like to continue forum failing be my guest though nervous.<br>

See how the scout has "evolved" in TF2 compared to this video of one of the best scouts of all time in TFC. There's a small problem of you can't, the scout has been nuetered in TF2.<br>

If you don't think that the tf2 video compares with the TFC video then the conversation is over, it's a matter of opinion because in my opinion, the tf2 video is just as impressive, considering you don't have grenades and all. i think that that video shows equality considering tf2 doesn't give you as many tools to jump (bunnyhopping, nades, etc)<br>

firstly, stfu, you're a total dick and i don't like you. <br>

secondly, i'm not talking about TFC being superior or not to tf2 in all aspects, i'm just saying i think they are pretty equal in terms of rocket jumping.<blockquote><div><cite>Ghost Dog_TSGK wrote:</cite>Tf2 is childs play in comparison, let's not lie to ourselves.<br>

	<div class="content">One of my experiences with punks was in Germany, where the punk rockers are actually anarchist skinhead Nazis.<br>
I was at a river party one night and some punk suckered me with a bottle, opening up a major cut.<br>
he did it because i was an American GI.<br>
One night, me and my buds, who had our bar that we frequented, had 6 of these punks come in.<br>
Somebody id'ed one of them as the one who suckered me.<br>
My Best friend Hyde, from Washington state went nuts, slicing through several of them.<br>
We kicked the shit out of those assholes.<br>
The fight awesome. We kicked their ass down the stairs and the fight continued on the street.<br>
They retreated, talking crap.<br>
<br>
I hate those bitches.<br>
And the music is lame.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I thought about putting this in the engineering section, but it's not really about server hosting.  This service &gt;<a href="http://www.gamerail.com/index.php" class="postlink">http://www.gamerail.com/index.php</a>&lt; in St Louis provides a "private network" for gaming.  Of course, there is a fee.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what to think about this type of service.  Sounds interesting.  My ISP is affiliated with Gamerail, but I have to sign up for a free trial period to find out if any of the servers I play on are peered with Gamerail.  <br>
<br>
Any of your servers peered?  Anyone ever try a service like this?  Scam or worth a try?  Lemme know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

edit:  meh, I think I misunderstood you Para.  I thought you were referring to an addtional cost for a server.  But now I don't think thats what you meant.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yes, that's correct Epoch.  Me, as the client, pay a fee to access the direct network to a peered server.  The server signs an agreement (or something like that) stating their server will not be used for any other internet activity besides the game on their server.  The idea is to avoid the usual internet logjam to gaming servers.  You'd have to click the links above to read a better explanation than I'm giving.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Huh, makes me wonder whether the server provide I'm going to use for my game server is affiliated with gamerail.  Its an interesting idea thats for sure.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Sweet!! velocity servers (the company im gonna use) and a host of other server providers are already peered with GameRail.  Seems like the list of server providers has all the ones I've heard of and a ton more that I haven't.  I've alwasy wanted a way to get nice low pings without shelling out money for my own T1 or something like that.  I might have to give this a try once I get my comp.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Since I'm in the St Louis metro area, I still may give this a try for a month.  What's five bucks for a little experiment?  I'll give a report back if I try it out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i wasnt making fun of holy, i was in there talking shit in his defense, not the reason i was banned tho... i went in there with the intention of keeping to myself and just playing some games but with book's ignorant taunts and accusations i became pissed off and when he ran from the server i was left with no one to vent on but the fucken mouth breathers.<br>
<br>
the server itself is garbage, but then when you put 12 fucking people on aim arena, and have 6 of your clan members talking on the mics, acting like they're under the influence of something, my guess would be dick, talking about the stupidest shit like the rest of the players have moist twats for anticipation of what they might say next, it lags even worse, and then they state "you're lagging" like your the only one teleporting around the map.. fucken a<br>
<br>
<br>
i dont care whos nice, or cool in that clan, anyone who associates themselves with that handfull of fucking brown eye bandits is a retard in my book, and when i say brown eye im not refering to anything optical.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I find this action to be a low down act and unbecoming of an Englishman or an organization from England.  Do you need us Americans to teach you some server etiquette?   This person is permanently banned from our two HL2DM servers as will be anyone wearing the same tag as a preventive measure.<br>

	<div class="content">in my defense, I did play for a little while before leaving.  I didn't just pop in to advertise HL2DMU and leave.  I came in cause you guys were running a map I like (dm_forgotten_sanctuary), got about 8-10 frags, then left to go find a standard gravity server.  the phrase in question is a phrase bind that I always hit upon leaving a server.  there are a lot of new players playing this game right now because of the ATI and Nvidia offers, and I like to point as many of them as possible in the direction of this site (which by the way will not affect your server traffic, will serve to increase it if anything by keeping people playing the game), so they can get the same help and resources that I had in learning this game so they do not have to learn it from the ground up like I did before discovering this site - which I have no affiliation with by the way, I just like to promote it when I can because I am interested in keeping people playing this game instead of quitting in frustration like I have seen quite a few do.<br>

if you still want to ban me from your servers for that, hey its your server and that is 100% your perogative dude.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i dont understand this either.  you come in here with your random clan and bash a well respected, intelligent, polite player of our community because he has "check this site out in his gg bind"?  did he spam it?  no he typed it once.  bottom line is nobody gives a fuck about your server that you are so intent on protecting.  in all actuality all you did is draw negative attention to it.  you will probably get more ppl spamming there now.  Also before you come in and post rediculas comments about us and this site, you might wanna do a little research on what you are actually saying.  Odog is american, to the best of my knowledge, and this site is based in the US.  Is this etiquette you speak of entail coming to the U forum and starting shit?  grow up asshole.  I take it your goal is to brain wash new players into thinking your server is the only one available, and to keep them there so your server rank can grow.......pfffft.  Do you make your clan drink "the koolaid"  all at the same time?   i cant imagine the amount of sleep Odog has lost over this, ummm, prolly not one bit.   IMO, this forum should be advertised on every server.  there is no better place for new and old players to come, learn, teach, express ideas, and shoot the shit.  If you dont like the idea of this site or the idea that Odog was advertising it, then dont come here and lock your server so that your sure only you loyal subjects will play there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Seems kind of retarded to be so "holier-than-thou" indignant about this. He was linking to a site that aims to promote the longevity of the game you need to remain popular to hike your almighty GameTracker stats.<br>

to each his own back atcha. <br>
what specifically looks like total crap.?. the lineup or the venue? both? i'm just curious.<br>
JBL SR-X Series 6 bass bins w/ dual 18s &amp; 4 tops w/ dual 15s &amp; horns! and db is pure win for me.<br>
have you ever heard of the dirty bird label? who else besides tiesto would you consider worth going to see live? or paying fifty bones for?<br>
+<br>
also do you go for the music, or the drugs,(i'll agree they can go hand in hand sometimes). <br>
or regardless of who is playing or where just to have a good time?<br>
<br>
i'll admit i have a bias to smaller parties where i know the promoter or the bar tender so i can save $ on heavy handed drinks rather than wait in line at overcrowded venues to ignored by wall flowers who spend more time on their mobile devices or can't handle their shit sick in the corner. i never understood people who pay all this money to miss the main reason of going to an event. <br>
<br>
the big shows can be fun if you like the huge crowds. lots of people can be a lot of fun. <br>

hope you have a good time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Meh...nothing really. I was just responding to all of the negativity because I decided I am going to a RAVE with tiesto djing. I like the dude. Never said he was the best and I'm not going to pass him comming within 30 miles of my house either. I guess nothing is wrong with your event I was just excited about going to the Tiesto bullshit. You can't tell me I'm wrong for likeing a particular type of music or DJ. Who the fuck are you Ninja to tell me what I should and shouldnt listen to and why should I rely on your opinions on music and piss poor judgement? Just my opinion bassed on your stupid ass comments. <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
"Also... Concerts in any venue aren't the same as the DVD concerts there, buddy. And you'll be waiting all friggin night for the man to show up. Trance is dying anyway."</div></blockquote>
I'm really glad you are here to tell me that shit isnt the same as it is on DVD, "Buddy". You seem like a bitter bastard trying to rain on my parade. In either case FUCK you.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
Anyway I go to alot of shows. I never said I only go to TIESTO concerts and I never claimed he was the best. I Like his music, he's comming to my area, I bought tickets and I'm going to it. MONEY isnt a problem for me and I go to the shows for a good time with friends, music and whatever else. I like the smaller shows as well you just pitched it to me like I should go to your friends show as apposed to what I had planned simply because you seemed to not like tiesto. There will probably be several smaller after parties in the area that I'll probably check out. The Crystal Ball room can only hold like a 1500 people so its not like its a HUGE show to begin with { <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=2&amp;id=658" class="postlink">http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=2&amp;id=658</a> } it should be fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You don't stop such activities with laws and police. You stop child abuse by fixing people's head. They should start realisin we've been investing money for years in laws and jails are full. Some drunk driver will kill a kid while driving, 15 years later hes out of jail, finally can get booze, drink some, go see some old friends, hits another kid on the way. You didn't fix the problem( this guy) you only hid it for x time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No supporting them in the prisons, real consequences for real crime, thats what we need. Drop all the bs like war on drugs and such, just concentrate on the basics, murder rape and stealing punish those and you'd have ur answer.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You cant fix child predator issues by trying to fix the predators any more than you can fix it with more cops / laws. Those people have made a choice; they arent insane, theyre evil (word loosely used), and therapy isnt going to amend their ways any more than soothing music is going to convince a bear thats aquired a taste for manflesh to revert to eating berries. The real answer is for people to not raise their children to be such easy victims; unfortunately for the kids, that would take a whole lot of social revolution to bring about, something not likely to happen anytime soon.<br>
<br>
The war on drugs is a joke too. All that money and effort still being wasted on a "solution" that proved itself a failure what, 30 years ago? Might as well open a set of buildings that give unlimited access to all hard drugs, 100% purity, to anyone who wanted them, with the single clause that they have to do the drugs on site. Open door and drugs at the front, body bags and hearses at the back, big chunk of the problem solving itself in the middle. Govt would save alot of money, prisons would be 50% emptier and the only casualties would be 100% consensual. Legalization would go a long way toward solving what remained of the drug issues after that.<br>
<br>
And ya, strong/harsh punishment for true crimes (rape, murder, kidnapping etc) would go a long way toward either possibly preventing crimes in the first place, or removing those who committed sin from the picture permanently. Not to mention, ive always wanted to have a guillotine adorning my town square!<br>
<br>
Gladiatior arenas would be a fine idea too, provided everyone who entered did so of their own free will.<br>

	<div class="content">So I'm preparing to buy my first car this summer and I was wondering what kind of car or transportation you homos drive, and also any recommendations or things to stay away from.<br>
<br>
I'm wanting a car, not a truck.  I want something 4-door; engine type isn't really important, although I'll probably get a v6 or v8.  I want something that can get up &amp; go, cause i wanna have some fun with it, too.<br>
<br>
So far I've found a nice manual eclipse that's interesting me and dodge intrepids aren't too bad.<br>
Price range for me: anything up to 7 grand.<br>
<br>
<br>
So yah post what you drive or what kinda car you would recommend for me, or both.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pics of your rides are appreciated.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sup con AKA car noob <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">. I've owned a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 2003 Honda Civic, 2002 Lexus LS430 and my new babe sorta is a 2004 Eclipse GS. I've ridden in alot of American cars but after owning three Japanese cars there is no competing period unless it's a truck. The Eclipse has been a good friend to me but like all my cars I've had I'm going to sell it for profit as much as I've liked it. Anything Toyota/Lexus is just the best reliability, comfort, the price holds up with these cars pretty damn good tho. Your choice of an Eclipse would be a wise one, it's great on gas and reliable as heck, but I do miss my Civic as much as any other car I've owned so I'd strongly advise looking into Civic/Accord too! If I had to choose between a Civic/Accord and an Eclipse it's about dead even so it comes down to taste. Happy hunting m8</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well I drive a Ford Explorer Sport Trac now by choice/necessity, but if I was going to get a car, I would probably look into something like a Ford Contour or Taurus both of which are known to be reliable.  I had a Ford Contour for a few years and it was a good car, never had any problems with it and I got rid of it when it had 90K + miles on it and it was still running fine.<br>
<br>
For me, I am 5'8" (not real tall but on the tall side for a female) and some of the small cars, well are too small for me because I dont get the leg room that I need to feel comfortable.  Their smallest Ford car, (not sure if that was an Eclipse or what) was one of those for me. They tried to sell me one before I bought the Contour and I was like, try again, this isnt gona work.<br>
<br>
I have ridden in many foreign cars as well (we have several at work) and I think American cars are way more comfortable to ride in than Japanese cars.  The seats seem bigger and more comfortable and ergonomic.  The suspension systems also seem better and give a smoother ride.  You tend to feel every crack in the road in some of them.  I also like American, because I choose to support American companies when I can, but thats me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

-_- Well in general sure american cars make bigger seats for the U.S. f@tasses but if your on the skinnier side theres no need for the bigger seats I.E. the Civic and Eclipse. The Lexus has held the luxury crown for how long now? To compete against the Lexus I bought I tried a BMW 740iL, an Audi A8, a Lincoln Town Car and a Cadillac Deville. The Deville did offer the most serious challenge to sheer comfort against the LS430 but it in the end it was like comparing a cheap one hit wonder fighter to an epic throughbred prizefighter. Stack up any U.S. luxury car against a Lexus RX,LS,GX any day of the weak and I'll bet the house on the Lexus, GG. BTW I will admit the Cadillac CTS and Escalade have been making huge strides in closing the gap against german and japanese luxury but the U.S. has ways to go yet. Anyway back to advice for Con lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
i used to be in the buy U.S. crowd.  but my last experience with a 98 Pontiac Grand Prix changed that.  the grand prix was a fun car, but absolute junk.  problems covered prior to the 30,000 mile warranty:  trunk leaked, passenger side power window froze, windshield leaked, moon roof froze.  problems not covered after the 30,000 mile warranty:  rack and pinion steering went out, power seat froze, both headlight covers popped off while driving (not at the same time, lol), water pump went out, drivers side power window froze, and when the tranny started slipping at 60k... i sold it.<br>
<br>
when i sold my (8 year old) 2000 toyota with 150k miles on it last year, i got more money for it than i did my (2 year old) 98 grand prix with 60k miles back in 2000.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

on the accord to stay in your price range. 03 saturn sl2 is also a good reliable car. get a carfax report on anything you are looking at and<br>
have a mechanic you trust look any car over. gm cars do not fall apart at 50k miles so if you see one you like don't be scared to consider it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

My dad was sponsored by Boeing to make a speech and run a diversity workshop to an elite group of Japanese engineers contracted by Boeing for the DreamBus project and Aerospace defense projects. My dad said after coming back he thought Japanese Aerospace and car engineers are in a completely different league then American engineers. He heard stories how if they made one little mistake or didn't make the best possible product on the budget they were on the person would disgrace the company, his life's work, his family and usually the engineer would immediately resign and apologize. He also heard stories of Toyota and Honda engineers committing suicide for making mistakes or subpar product...Here the in the U.S. we just sue the sh1t out of everybody not caring who specifically makes the poor choices or mistakes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

for 7 grand i'd say go to a dealership and see what you can get pre-owned. dealerships are so desperate to move cars off the lot you'll sure to get a decent deal.<br>
you have good credit you could finance at zero to close to zero percent if you have a job.<br>

Val, its not the size of the seats, it is how they are made they are just more comfortable, period.  I have ridden in a small sized Toyota truck and the same class Ford truck and the Ford wins hands down. The toyota was like driving while sitting on two boards put together at a right angle and calling it a seat.  Same goes for similar sized cars which if you are gona compare, compare cars of similar size and class.  I never rode in a lexus, but they are a different class altogether and I would bet given their reputation and the kind of client they attract (at least around here that = BMW and Mercedes wannabies), yea they better be comfortable to ride in.   But for us shlubs who cant afford a nice lexus, its a different story.<br>
<br>
I did rent a mitsubishi once and (forget what model) it was a fun little car to drive.  It had quite a bit of pep and was quite sporty.  I decided I had better stick to trucks (which I love anyway) because the speed factor of some of the sports cars were just too dangerous for my personality type and I would have had a lot of speeding tickets I think.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I'm not a GM hater, I'm a hater of mass produced slapped together pipe dream blueprinted piles of shit with wheels, you can drive, trade and sell all the cars you want, tear down the blocks of these engines and take a good long look at the mass of cheap barely machined crap parts compensating for overpaid union dues in every domestic model out there,lift the bodies off and take a good long look at your bare minimum suspension setup as GM brags to you about their latest failed replica of Germany and Japan's independent suspensions(the same "upgrade" German and Japanese models give to you STANDARD no questions asked). <br>
<br>
I know the truth about these cars because I see every inch of them, and my father also has been heavily involved in the automotive industry and all aspects of the decades worth of engineering changes/copies/failures U.S. automakers have put us mechanics through, and he will admit our domestics are inferior shitpiles unless you want to buy a marquis model and get raped.<br>
<br>
You think I want to tell people how shitty our domestic cars are?They leave me no choice and the latest GM confidence campaign bullshit they're spreading around is a slap in the face just like Chrysler using their giant bailout to buy a $125,000 USA today advertisement thanking us for saving their stupid asses.<br>
<br>
They expect us to have confidence in them now? They can kiss our ass and get with the program before they lose it all, stop the bullshit price hikes, stop the bullshit claims of innovative vehicles that are 5 years behind the loop at best, stop the $75,000 hybrid trucks that get 2 to 3 mpg more then their gas aspirated original, stop ripping off their own customers ,why can I go to an auto parts store, ask for a 110 amp delco alternator for a Oldsmobile Cutlass 85 and get a price quote of $135, ask for the same alternator for a cadillac (any 4.1 model) with the same ID# at a GM parts distributor that part suddenly went up another $125, because they don't give a fuck unless you're there to buy a new pile of shit, only then do they think about giving a shit until you need engine repair (and you very much will).<br>
<br>
This is but a taste of the bullshit me,my father and his father have dealt with behind the scenes of these "fabulous big 3" automakers, I'll never forget when I blew the clutch on my 2003 eclipse spyder and I beat the living shit out of that clutch beyond fubar, while our local Mitsubishi dealer was showing me the paper work to sign their technician was right there next to us laughing about how he had never seen such blatant abuse to a brand new clutch and how it fell out in pieces on the floor, at that moment any GM dealership would have flipped the fuck out and disclaimed all repairs on my car indefinitely, the Mitsubishi dealer was doing what he could to get me a free upgrade to a high pressure Lancer clutch (this was when these cars were 3 months old tops) and he was successful with one phone call to corporate they basically said fuck yeah he can have it get off the phone duh.<br>
<br>
Domestic automakers used to be legendary and had the models to back that up, now they're a joke and even this bailout scare didn't change a thing they're all right back to doing the stupidest shit with the money their marketing failures can come up with.So far the only one that has showed a glimmer of hope is Ford, and I fucking hate Ford but at least they know they were full of shit before, GM and Dodge still act like they did no wrong and sold us platinum wrapped gold, all they sell is shit wrapped shit for the price of platinum wrapped gold.<br>
<br>
If this is the trend GM plans on continuing with they are fucked, and should have sold their shit to Toyota when they had the chance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

my post was personal experience.  nothing says quality like pulling up to a stoplight, hitting a small bump, having your headlight lens pop off, and running over it.  then... having it happen again with the other headlight lens 6k miles later.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>

That's because chevy trucks are their "marquis" model, and 150k is about the best they will do on a lucky day considering the amount of transmissions I have personally changed especially the 90's models just to see their engine give out a week later like it was planned to do it.<br>
<br>
Yeah briggs I'm quite aware mustangs aren't a gm product...<br>
<br>
My point is they aren't mustangs anymore they are glorified escorts, unless you want to get raped for a shelby model you aren't driving a mustang and even then I don't trust the new shelby models because he doesn't have enough say in the build like it used to be.FFS I have a 2.0 liter engine sitting in my garage,natural aspiration that will run circles around any one of these piece of shit 4.7 V8 and all it has on it is a $300 centerline head. I would advise against anybody planning on buying a mustang released later than 1989 unless you want to get smoked at a red light by a base model jetta 5 speed with a 4 banger.<br>
<br>
I'm not surpised a 1996 jeep cherokee is running well because once again it is a marquis model, the engine isn't built it's contracted and even then the AMC 360 and 318 v8 are nothing compared to what they used to be, early model dodge cars and trucks used to rust the entire body off before the motor gave out but no not these days, 4 years into your purchase the bitch runs hot,leaks oil and already has exhaust leaks popping up.<br>
<br>
The only good domestic cars for sale today are "performance line" vehicles aka redline,svt,rt etc and those feature so called upgrades that come stock on their competition, and I doubt they did a good job planning out longevity for any of those models I'm pretty sure they said make it look different, go faster than the old one and get it done fast. They do not give a fuck I assure you.<br>
<br>
The only vehicle made by a domestic manufacturer that is worth anything is the hummer, not the civilian H2/3/4/5/"why the fuck did you buy this model" model, I mean the H1 diesel model and the only reason that's good is because our government made them do it.<br>
<br>
BTW for the original post, never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever buy a intrepid or any other model matching it sebrings and all that crap.<br>
<br>
Take a stroll through the junkyard with me (any one will do) and have a look at all the intrepids/sebrings/concorde models lined up broken,junked and beat down and you notice that nobody is even taking spare parts off of them for a reason.<br>
<br>
Keefy isn't lying either 100k is nothing to celebrate on a real engine, hell just 2 years ago I dragged a 1978 318 V8 out of my friends yard that had been sitting in bare weather for 3 years maybe more getting rain snow the works on it, after it already had 218,000 miles put on it from a Dart, the motor was seized up and after we pulled the spark plugs and poured transmission fluid into the cylinders,grabbed the crankshaft with a breaker bar while turning the starter it broke loose and is still running to this day with 300k + miles on it in a dodge 100.<br>
<br>
Then I see these 1990 and up 318 V8's with valves ticking and pistons slapping they're a joke.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok well post back when your ford has 200K + on it and it is still running the original spark plugs and wires and manages to pass smog test ( if you even have that in NY, its pretty tough to do in CA ) at the same time. Granted the fords and chevy's have both advanced reliability wise since the late 80's but I hate to see people bash or mis-inform others based on fanboyism.

<br>
I probably wont have it that long because I will trade it in for a new one.  Although with the economy the way it is I might not.  It does have the original plugs and wires, hasnt needed a tuneup yet.  I also live on the coast (salt air).  NY also has pretty strict emissions tests and there are cars wayyy older than mine running around with current inspection stickers.   Anyone can seize and engine at 5000 miles?   Really?  5000?   Only vehicle I ever knew to do that was GM.  Of course if the factory guys fucked up and didnt fill it properly to start off with.  If it was losing that much oil in only 5000 miles to cause it to seize then there was something else wrong.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Exactly what I referring too, and with any make its possible that a mistake happened at the factory and enough oil was not put in to begin with.

Actually the newer Shelby and Saleen models aren't that bad, although I prefer a Saleen over a Shelby any day unless we're talking 20-30 years back when Shelby built beautiful cars. For me personally, I wouldn't spend a dime on any of the newer vehicles, anything after 2004 for Mustang's is junk to me. Also, in 2004 the Cobras were built pre supercharged which is quite wonderful, although you can definitely make the car go faster. And I don't know about the comment of a Jetta wooping a Mustang... Depends on which one... We talking a commuting 4 cylinder or a Cobra or Saleen here?<br>

Mustangs are beautiful cars. But I wouldn't get anything newer then a 2004.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That car is my old reliable and I still use it when I'm gonna go out and hang out with friends where I know its sketchy. <br>
<br>
Recently though I've been driving my grandfathers '01 Cadillac DeVille and I'm in love with it. Great to go out to somewhere nicer in and the V8 makes me smile every time I turn it on. The suspension on the car is miles above my old Buick which I found scary at first because I felt the road on it and getting disconnected from that was weird. Still its a great car to drive around and is probably the one I'll use for dates and the like. I'd post pictures but I can't at the moment.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No, not really. Renaults aren't sold in the states and I think the only way you can get one is by importing it which turns into a BITCH if it needs repairs or something along those lines.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

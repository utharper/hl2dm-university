If there is a DM game used in pro competition it will be this one for at least a year.

	<div class="content">I don't know where the video is coming from, but I was able to run a Mp server via the demo and it didn't work good. <br>
Granted it said it was WIP and by the way it ran that was a understatement, but I was kinda baffled as to why the dev would even release such a POS demo.<br>
The experience I had led me to believe the demo was an example of where the dev was at with the game and his skills seem lacking.<br>
I can only hope the final product is nothing like the demo and will be fun to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I should add one other thing pain killer as a game hinged it's entire success on one stroke of luck. The CPL was in its prime and DM gaming was giving out the most money ever at that time when they ran PK through smart negotiation with the PK dev team. If it was not for that PK would not have made anyone blink. That explains why their later expansions did not really get much attention since Q4 had replaced it. So the big question is now that there is very little if any money in 1v1 DM will this game even have anything going for it? I would not preorder for this game I would definitely wait and see unless you are a PK fan and know you are going to buy it no matter what.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

After this game and several others of late being released in a total BS condition I am starting to get mad at Valve/Steam for selling them even though they did not produce them. I think in order to be sold on steam the game should be tested and proven to be playable by Valve or it doesn't go up for sale there. I would not mind waiting for how ever long it took to get a working game and think that Steam could become known as a place where only good/properly running games are sold, a buy with confidence type of place if you will.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Alright yesterday was my first, idk if its always that long but BLOODY HELL it was awfully slow, the player pick is like "oh please" long,<br>
<br>
I had great fun regarding the rest of the draft night.<br>
<br>
What i'd suggest is whoever is in charge of the draft night (yesterday was ninojman for teams) <br>
<br>
USE "THE HAT", i had no idea teams worked that way, use the hat...no really use it.<br>
<br>
Just put in the names (or import from file) The hat picks up a random name for you then delete it from the "to be picked" list. so lets say you think "lets pick the first guys of all team" you click randomize 5 times and those 5 names are the people you're going to see and ask to go in team 1-2-3-4-5 depending on the order.<br>
<br>
You save: <br>
<br>
-time<br>
-energy<br>
-people complaining about how long it takes<br>
<br>
AND in the next draft nights names are already all there, just delete/add players if necessary.<br>
<br>
Also it saves up the bad feeling to the bunch of guys who are most likely not going to be picked up cuz people don't know who they are.<br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>
<br>
It's Free, The Hat!<br>

	<div class="content">Oh yes. This is a brilliant idea. We could definitely use this. Waiting for more people to show up and assigning teams just takes too damn long.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Me and joule were talking about it and he mentioned something of major interest, -Stacking <br>
<br>
Again i'd blindly trust whoever is taking care of making teams but to even things i ought about something.<br>
<br>
Instead of the hat you can also use a football (or a soccer/hockey etc) Roster manager (theres tons of these freewares all over the place) and put good players under ''good players'' and very new players under ''new players'' and click balance/randomize.<br>
<br>
win!<br>

No, the captains are chosen, and then the captains choose their team.  It is a draft.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

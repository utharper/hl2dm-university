Dammit.  Dude.  I saw the big PayPal logo and didn't go any further.  Did you already place the order?  Cause it would be easier to just do it myself now, but if you already ordered it that's cool.  <br>
I'm going out to my hut and finish this peyote.  I'll be back in a few days after a naked Indian, Ghost Dog, Jim Morrison, Timothy Leary and I finish our discussion on dumplings.  Last time all Leary wanted to do is talk about "the good ol' days".  I hate when he starts that shit.  Same old stories, over and over.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I live beside the dumpster behind IHOP.  Slippery Pete usually picks up my mail, but don't let him this time.  If he figures out there's a new shirt in there he'll keep it.  He stole my paper plate collection a few days ago, and he took my cape that I wear to the mall a few days before that.  About six weeks ago someone took my best grocery cart with all my bandannas.  I had two broken radios in there too.  He swears he didn't do it, but we all know how that fucker lies.<br>

	<div class="content">It takes you to a Japanese website though. Its kind of weird. I think its propaganda for a movie or something else that they are just fooling with. Paraphrasing here, but from the captions on the website it said something like "the future of our race is with the Junsui" but after its done telling you a bit about these people, all the characters are female by the way, it glitches and then goes to the said person breaking down into a heaving motion randomly sort of like a scary movie when the people turn into zombies. Random website. I can tell a lot has gone into it.<br>

It's kinda reminiscent of some of the things that ABC was putting out there about the Dharma Initiative for Lost.<br>

Some of the text on the page translated by <a href="http://translation.babylon.com/Japanese" class="postlink">http://translation.babylon.com/Japanese</a> says:

	<div class="content">Indeed. There is just a shit ton to this more then just clicking. There is 3 separate videos. My gf found one of a girl naked laying in a corner and she was just waiting for the girl to get dragged out of the room lol. Theres a bunch of tabs to go through also. <br>
<br>
Funny enough a guy was making these elaborate ass points on the Facebook page too basically tearing apart the whole theme. <br>
<br>
For the other techies out there, you may find this interesting...<br>

"Andy Garcia<br>
alfa-tsentr does not exist.<br>
<br>
the site was registered in june of 09 and was last modified july of 09 according to whois records.<br>
<br>
the site is registered as .ru, but its servers are hosted in the United States (Dothost, nameservers registered from Dreamhost.)... Read More<br>
<br>
for a company that does not want to do business with the us, uk, or israel, having its servers hosted in the us makes no sense!<br>
<br>
the login page is a flash animation and upon examination with a decompiler, is not programmed to actually do anything.<br>
<br>
the wikipedia article was created in july; all of the references are bad or difficult to verify. there are very few contributors, and the talk page is void of any information.<br>
<br>
who is the true enemy?"<br>
<br>
"Andy Garcia<br>
alfa-tsentr's webpage uses flash for its logins.<br>
<br>
it uses the padlock icon to signify secure logins (in the manner of SSL) yet it uses flash without any encryption.<br>
<br>
adobe's products (reader, flash) have been targeted heavily by hackers, moreso than microsoft's, in 09. why would a corporation use an insecure technology like flash for logging its users in, when other methods such as SSL already exist?... Read More<br>
<br>
the webpage also does not provide the normal locale support expected from most webpages. it does not auto-detect language, nor does it use a cookie to keep the setting consistent for future visits. the login flash also remains in russian when changing to english.<br>
<br>
these flaws in web design are too great for any halfway-intelligent corporation to overlook.<br>
<br>
if a cursory glance at the evidence (at least, the evidence we are given) shows large flaws, how can we know that this is the true enemy? what are we not being told?"<br>
<br>
"Andy Garcia<br>
the video footage is not live. the footage sent is a recording, and which segments are sent is determined by the current system time, which is overlayed on the top of the feed by the video player.<br>
<br>
the video itself is being hosted by IMediaSee, which is owned by Broadline Media Corporation. BMC is located in the U.S.<br>
<br>
if alfa-tsentr is the enemy, why would they choose a US-based media host for their video? why would they choose to stream surveillance footage in the first place? if a mole were planted in alfa-tsentr to sneak the video out, would it not have been found and easily been taken down by alfa-tsentr?...

<br>
we are not being given the whole picture. who is the real enemy?"</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

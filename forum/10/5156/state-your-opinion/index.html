	<div class="content">Ok been thinking on this subject unless ppl actually read these forums from here followin your link da11 Valve is gonna have to look in a thirdparty mod section for a plea on hl2:dm?  I'm not trying to criticize its just a little hard to spot and again people are still not gonna realize that hl2:dm is up for OB raping of the bunnyhop unless they follow these forums so how to reach all those players that have not been following these forums or dm for a while?<br>
<br>
 There is currently 4000 peeps in the dm-u group it is a great way to reach every1 by spamming every1 an event on the hour each hour to bring there attention to this very topic.  Another issue presented by doing that is causing ppl to leave the group due to event spamming and setting up all the events of the group as well is quite a pain but it would reach all those players that have at 1 time loved this game.<br>
<br>
 So now if we can say get 35 ppl from that group thats an extra 35 ppl I myself am gonna set it up for the hl2dm community group I have thats only 169 ppl or so.  Also another point is that there needs to be organization under a single banner we can't have 5-801 topics about keeping the bhop but more than just a hey pls keep bhop ingame thx for a starting post so maybe somebody who is probably reading this forum to copy and paste some text with a full explanation on what all the bhop is, has given this game, and does for the players of this game; well worded and hopefully some1 doesn't mind having the said statement stolen for plagiarism, so long as it goes towards the overall benefit of the game.<br>
<br>
I will be setting my group up for every hour on the half hour along with a full explanation as to why this events attack has started. Now then the simple reason as for the every hour event spam people don't spot events usually and it doesn't stay on the screen for long also there is nothing to show that you missed an event while you were offline so this will reach ppl that are getting on at random times.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
so far we have these as topic ranges <br>
<br>
how long and how many ppl have used the advanced movement<br>
how much you can benefit by it<br>
how much will be ruined without it<br>
how many maps that will become unusable without it<br>
quite a few of val's<br>
<br>
any topic or point that can be added as it is very early here it would be helpful for ppl that are actually fully coherent to help us nightowls out <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

what would happen is what the coder will do with the code. as simple as that. there are no restrictions and all you want ported over from the current engine to the new one can. this is about what Valve thinks SHOULD be ported over.<br>
we're ASSUMING, given the fact most games nowadays are noobed down to accommodate larger audiences, that the OB port will lose bhop etc. we DO NOT KNOW that or the other. these are just assumptions.<br>
that said, at the same time we're also ASSUMING this is up for grabs at this point and basically the loudest group will sway the scales. there are those who want bhop and there are those who don't.<br>
yeah?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">These days alot of players class jumping 2 or 3 times as bunnyhopping or even jumping out from a corner to surprise an enemy but only if you kill them of course.<br>
Chances are there are alot more players that do not, cannot and are 100% against bunnyhop than those of us in favour, HL2DM if ree after all tand the mostpopular servers are the crappy co-op roleplay pices of shit which require no skill what so ever so there you go.<br>

	<div class="content">If they get rid of the annoying bugs and keep movement as it is or better yet implement sub-zero movement which I find more smoother than original I would be sold and might come back to hl2dm. If not well that would be the final nail in the coffin. There would be no reason to play and be even more boring than css. Yes you heard me more boring than a game completely based on aim and slow moving targets. Ohh and please remove the free hl2dm it may allow more peeps in the game but I like many is feed up with VACs that keep reappearing with a new steam account and a new free hl2dm copy. <br>
<br>
I will try and contribute to that thread never posted on steam but I will give my support for what it is worth I probably try and not rant so much like I have done here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

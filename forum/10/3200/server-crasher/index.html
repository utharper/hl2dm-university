	<div class="content">So... I was in a random server when some "chick" named Heather came in and started an argument, when I gave it back to her she said "shut up or I will crash the server". The guys in the server said "yeah she just did it like 5 minutes ago" so now I was curious and said "go ahead"... and "she" did!! Is THIS possible and how??  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> <br>

Or "blank out" the offending mani folder on your server.<br>
<br>
Kinda like removing malware from your computer... it feels odd for a while, what with the lack of flashy popups, random site redirects, free unexpected downloads and all, but in the end its generally worth it. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Great. Here’s mine:<br>
<br>
<br>
•	Easy editable Chat triggered sounds – allow for two options here, if possible: overlapping (takes more mem) and not overlapping (less mem).<br>
•	Enable different headshot on-screen text and sounds for: 357, xbow and shotgun. (allow for easy editing)<br>
•	Enable stunstick and crowbar pwnage on-screen and sound triggers – with easy editing.<br>
•	Death triggers<br>
•	Easy editable RPG second / third usage sound and on-screen triggers<br>
•	Easy editable SLAM second / third usage sound and on-screen triggers<br>
•	Would it be possible to somehow make a connection with HLSW, when you’re perm banning an ID or IP it would immediately be written into the server files.<br>
•	Easier editing of map adverts – having more options here would be super (e.g. different locations on screen, more colors..a hex list to choose from maybe..?..)<br>
•	Easy editing what a client can and cannot type in chat (client typing anything starting with ma_ (taking the example from mani) would immediately ban that client.<br>
•	Remove the stupid Gimb, burn and yo mama gadgets.<br>
•	Work out some sort of auto map change script when server is empty – with easy editing. Idea here is in a regular mapcycle some maps are more popular and some aren’t…on empty server, after a delay or ### map changes to a dm_pupolar and keeps on playing it until client logs in, then it goes back to the usual mapcycle.<br>
•	A more solid AFK mechanism than those around today, one which different admins can modify to their own preference without being a rocket scientist. This script should offer two AFK types (face wall for ## sec or typing (for example) !Away<br>
•	SP script that allows easy editing the timelimit since player spawn.<br>
•	Easy editable Auto name change script (unconnected /  annamed / or name that is conflicting with a possible word/name censor?)<br>
•	Easy editable map timelimit counter with optional on-screen and sounds.<br>
•	Easy editable votemap (with RTV)<br>
•	Easy editable admin panel – who is god admin, who are minor admins, other optional admin rights…less flags and medals – just simple and to the point: writing the STEAM ID and put the desirable option next to it or have a list of diff admin class and just write the STEAM ID/s on the same line next to the desirable admin class. This script can / should also provide editing the same functionality of the current (mani) clients.txt simply since next to (for example) admin class “clan member” you would put your mates STEAM IDs. This admin class by default would simple mean they are allowed to wear the clan tag. Others doing this will be kicked.<br>
<br>
<br>
•	You’ll note I’m basically asking for more solid and easier alternatives to all mani, mm, es functionalities. Not only do I hate having to deal with 2000000 plug-ins, im also not sure why they’re written so complex. Not-too-dumb people like myself are n00b admin simple because all this is so complex, every time I need to update or edit / add anything in my plug-ins I need a vacation.<br>
Also the server’s mem consumption is a factor with too much plug-ins. Not to mention mani and others were written for CSS and have tons issues in DM which you know about.<br>
<br>
•	Have things built in a way where you simply have in autoexec / server.cfg one line execing your plug-in and in your plug-in files have a cpanel of sorts that you can edit / edit out which functions you want. In general, less clatter than with the current set of plug-ins we have, without the need to edit 2000 different files to make one thing function like with the sounds and votemap.<br>
<br>
•	BTw, if you need any help with sounds hit me up. (Normalizing, post-processing sounds effects, compression, EQ, whathaveyou…or if you’re looking for sounds you don’t have / want…)<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot. If this will happen it will be a real blessing.<br>

I guess you mean: in console. (?) Anyway, I think kicking would be enough to make the point. But since that is client sided, I fear it may be dificult.

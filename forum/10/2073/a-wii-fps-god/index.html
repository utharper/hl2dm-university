	<div class="content">From my eyes, all PC gamers are Wii haters. Because theres a stereotype about how all Wii gamers are little kids, and how all games have sucky graphics. But <strong class="text-strong">The Conduit</strong> might end this, along with CoD5.<br>

<strong class="text-strong">I dont want to click the link, what is it:</strong><br>
Instead of E rated, boring shovelware, this game is made with true care. With mid-level 360 grade graphics, a in-depth storyline, 16 online multiplayer. As all great games, a near-future shooter. Look at everything, images, videos, and all the features. As you can see, the game is going from pre-alpha stage to pre-beta. And boy has it improved. If you want proof about graphics watch the video "Makes us believe".<br>
<br>
Enjoy!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I know allot of players that have a wii so really your view is wrong. Tho me personally don't give a shit about any wii game not like i hate it just that I have a console that has a stock of games that suit me. Tho i might get a wii for my little sister plus the graphics does not impress me but i really don't care about that stuff when i look for in a good game what matters is the heart and soul of the game the game play that above all else is what really matters. Just that with more powerful consoles u get both which is nice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">OK, so back to the reason Zak started this thread, I wasn't too impressed with the photos but the video looked pretty cool for The Conduit!  I wonder what that will be like, trying to use a Wii-mote in a first person view.  Could be a huge success.  It's good to see Nintendo is making a game like this, maybe start attracting a different crowd.  I don't own a Wii but I hear it is fun for some good entertainment.  Hell, apparently you can get exercised with Wii fit - LMAO!!  The only exercise I want whilst playing a video game is lifting my drink to my mouth!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Everybody was iffy about there track record, but this should be great. Medal of Honour Heroes is okay I guess, with 32 online, but theres only 6 maps and its to chaotic. Metroid was cool but only single player. So this will be awesome for any Wii owners. There thinking of adding voicechat to!<br>

True, I was thinking more on the lines of having a game like this on a Nintendo platform.  I figured Nintendo would only allow games with guns that shot out baby pink bunnies which would attack their enemies by pooping on them!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

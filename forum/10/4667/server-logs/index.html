	<div class="content">Pulled these out of 3 scrim logs from the other night. Filled with them throughout the whole scrim. All three rounds have similar text in them. This is from the command sv_report_client_settings 1; Blas and Bahlk, I'm assuming that you're both using a bind that has cl_cmdrate 100 bound with something else (Jump, Attack1, Weapon switch). I can't think of any other way that you would be able to spam the server with these settings. Why have two things bound to a key. I'm not here to start a bunch of drama, but I think anyone who plays this game still will appreciate an answer about this.<br>

More like, turn off part of the pathetic source lag compensation when using hitscan close range, so when you have your xhair dead over the enemy and press fire, you get an actual registered hit instead of just a ton of fake clientside blood.<br>
<br>
Different interp values for hitscan and prediction weapons is a pretty good idea as well, considering the former is lag compensated and the latter is not.</div></blockquote>

Moral of this story: At close range, with hitscan, interpolation is generally bad. Turn it off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Basically the CAL config and the warzone configs turn on a server variable called sv_report_client_settings 1; this in turn reports back the clients cmdrate and any changes in it. It seems it always reports the cmdrate if any of the net variables change (updaterate, rate, interpolate).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That config wasn't used by PB or anyone in ewR during a CAL match.  It was written as a joke before a 1v1 with Luke and a few other people to see how long it would take to hear the bitching.  He used it on Luke 1st because we knew $W would be anal enough to check server logs or have someone watching the console in HLSW.  It took a week and a half before it got back to us.  A little later we heard that you were trying to get CALACS modified just to catch a config that was of no use whatsoever.  We lol'd.<br>

  not that it matters i guess<br>
  if it was just billy that would be pissed off i'd do it<br>
  but they all know<br>
  and not all of them are bad so i rather not step on everyones toes right?<br>

9:47 AM but not a lot of people have access to it, or at least i never see many people in there<br>

  prob doesnt even matter<br>
9:49 AM eh w/e im out<br>

The config in question with 'exec lab' hidden within it and a xhair pack that I was making with all ugly and off centered xhairs were going to be released together as PB's personal package of win.  There was a movie planned too launched off of sF's conversation with Fearsome.  We quti playing though, and never finished the master plan. The matches and scrims we won, all of them, were legit.  You can believe it or not, but after multiple demos and SS being submitted on several occasions and no hacks found, you'd think people would start to get the picture.<br>
<br>
The thing I find the most funny about the whole ordeal is that people come here to complain about being banned from a server or laughing at pub players who accuse higher level players of hacking, are often the same ones, doing the very same thing when players came along with skills that trumped their own.  <blockquote class="uncited"><div>Pot: "Kettle, you're black!"</div></blockquote> In any sport, at the highest levels, mind games become a dominant factor in who's walking away with a win or loss.  ewR's tactic was nothing more than a huge mind game on the community.  Make you hate us, make you suspicious, make you lose focus and it worked, over and over and over again.  A player who's focus has shifted from communicating and concentrating on winning to trying to find your hidden secrets or hax will lose on a regular basis.  Most times they just give up.<br>
Apparently being in ewR needs to require monthly dues, because buying hacks for every PC and console game we play is getting expensive.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When?  There was no hacking.  Rates =/= Hacks.  The config was absolutely useless for anything but making people scratch their heads.

It was allowed. The first portion of that rule (the only rule to mention rates, btw; interpolation isnt mentioned at all, anywhere) is vague bs anyway, and was never once enforced. Interpolate 0 was really only useful with shotgun at medium or closer range though, or on truly terrible servers, and the jitter it caused was fairly awful so i cant imagine it saw much use.<br>

<br>
Scripts arent hacking...you should see how much professional CS 1.6 mod their configs up to any breaking points and loopholes around any configs. Not that I defend what PB did but its not as if his config made him that much better, I knew him before he had a modded config and still had massive talent. I know Nutri never messed around with scripts, he was as good if not better then PB and just used sheer mag aim. Blas and Bahlk tried to experiment independant of PB's configs with no advice from him and their scripts failed in that they used one script on one weapon and it actually made the register worse for them, I told blas to take it off a long time ago because it seemed like his shotty got suddenly worse. I have never tried a script or mod my config because I think it's overrated but I do realize all the best players in this game have tweaked their configs pretty heavily at some point.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Considering how I have played billy more than anyone here I should throw some shit into this, even though he would probably say "newguy, stfu you fucking queer bum looker."<br>
<br>
The .cfg billy posted here is almost nothing like the one he actually uses or used in the past; he gave out his real one to Gina, myself, Frank, and sisterFISTER. The keybinds are similar, but all the shit in question in second half of this thread - the rates and such - is non-existent in the config I was sent.  <br>
His only rule (, for me at least,) was that you had to beat him in a 1v1 before you could re-release it, and considering that I only tied him recently (bio :: 17-17), I won't post his real shit. <br>
He has now blocked me on steam friends (for an unrelated reason) and I don't know when I will 'be able' to post his config, but I have a feeling it will be soon. Yah.<br>
However, I can tell you that originally he was making a crazy unconventional .cfg well after the last season of CAL and before I was accepted into EE. It involved shit like making his cmdrate 66 for hitscan weapons, changing his mouse sens for the ar2 (to make 180-270 degree orbs easier), making cmd 100 for grav gun, etc; all the shit you all are discussing he tried to do, except the interpolate shit. <br>
<br>
So then, after making this cfg, he loses twice to luke, both times on the $W server. <br>
14-13 on LA, in which luke had 8 headshots, and some horrible score on LD that he did not want to mention is TS. It was like 20-7 or someshit. Yah ...bad. <br>
And this was after luke lost rather badly three times in a row 2 days before to billy, but this type of information is tertiary and benign. Moving on.<br>
Sum of the story is he abandoned this 'new .cfg idea' and promptly switched the old one that I was given. <br>
<br>
Then Rico gets an idea, one that would have the a-scientific way that $W uses to investigate 'hackers' blow up in their face. <br>
More specifically, Rudy's face. <br>
It started with billy making this .cfg more shifty, then sister makes that convo he posted, then eventually - after weeks of acting and drama - the demo that fear gets is billy jumping around caverns that has nothing but custom Rick Astley textures (made by sister) and "voice_loopback 1" playing some ultra-loud Rick-Rolling tunes with hlss.     <br>
<br>
Yah, that's .ewR, I in fact made that hlss suggestion to sister in teamspeak. <br>
Rico then banned me for exceeding my "word-count." <br>
<br>
It would have been epic, but then the game got put on life-support, and now no one gives a shit. <br>
I kinda had a feeling that sister would not finish this rick rolling map, his hobbies being what they are. <br>
<br>
In other words, I took a whole novel of a post to say this: grainbilly were - and still are - completely legit; all naysayers are butthurt bum lookers in need of a new sphincter.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
The .cfg billy posted here is almost nothing like the one he actually uses or used in the past; he gave out his real one to Gina, myself, Frank, and sisterFISTER. The keybinds are similar, but all the shit in question in second half of this thread - the rates and such - is non-existent in the config I was sent.  <br>
His only rule (, for me at least,) was that you had to beat him in a 1v1 before you could re-release it, and considering that I only tied him recently (bio :: 17-17), I won't post his real shit. <br>
He has now blocked me on steam friends (for an unrelated reason) and I don't know when I will 'be able' to post his config, but I have a feeling it will be soon. Yah.<br>
However, I can tell you that originally he was making a crazy unconventional .cfg well after the last season of CAL and before I was accepted into EE. It involved shit like making his cmdrate 66 for hitscan weapons, changing his mouse sens for the ar2 (to make 180-270 degree orbs easier), making cmd 100 for grav gun, etc; all the shit you all are discussing he tried to do, except the interpolate shit. <br>
<br>
So then, after making this cfg, he loses twice to luke, both times on the $W server. <br>
14-13 on LA, in which luke had 8 headshots, and some horrible score on LD that he did not want to mention is TS. It was like 20-7 or someshit. Yah ...bad. <br>
And this was after luke lost rather badly three times in a row 2 days before to billy, but this type of information is tertiary and benign. Moving on.<br>
Sum of the story is he abandoned this 'new .cfg idea' and promptly switched the old one that I was given. <br>
<br>
Then Rico gets an idea, one to show the a-scientific way that $W uses to investigate 'hackers' blow up in their face. <br>
More specifically, Rudy's face. <br>
It started with billy making this .cfg more shifty, then sister makes that convo he posted, then eventually - after weeks of acting and drama - the demo that fear gets is billy jumping around caverns that has nothing but custom Rick Astley textures (made by sister) and "voice_loopback 1" playing some ultra-loud Rick-Rolling tunes with hlss.     <br>
<br>
Yah, that's .ewR, I in fact made that hlss suggestion to sister in teamspeak. <br>
Rico then banned me for exceeding my "word-count." <br>
<br>
It would have been epic, but then the game got put on life-support, and now no one gives a shit. <br>
I kinda had a feeling that sister would not finish this rick rolling map, his hobbies being what they are. <br>
<br>
In other words, I took a whole novel of a post to say this: grainbilly were - and still are - completely legit; all naysayers are butthurt bum lookers in need of a new sphincter.</div></blockquote>

This was in Jan. of '08. <br>
I changed the keybinds around to wsad movement becasue I was retarded, but now its esdf. <br>
Then, when he DID try this unconventional shit, i was when he was 1v1ing me on LA that he realize his shotty was terrible with the interpolate shit and threw it out even before playing luke.<br>

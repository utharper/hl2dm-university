	<div class="content">If someone ever went ahead and made new hl2dm what would you want to keep or removed/ replace or add?<br>
<br>
I think first thing I would do is separate the game into three different modes of gameplay or so like DM,COP,CTF all package into one game. This is mainly due to making the game appeal to a wide group as possible from a pure business point in adding value to the game more value easier to sell it. Current hl2dm has these but this is all about getting the person to buy the game if you don't spell out these things then they go unheard and wasted. Hl2dm marketing point is chuck objects at peeps online is very vague considering hl2dm consist of far more than that UI for server would have option in search for these server that run a particular mode like it is with tf2.   <br>
<br>
Training course this is where it is made clear that bhop is part of the game and set out to help the player to gain that skill. Ways in doing that is have everything setup for them from the start no searching to find a setup that would work. So by default jump will come as scroll up or down with key binds that most of us use this is mainly to give players the best less taxing way of doing bhop. Training would be composed of training maps each made to build a certain skill on, such as starfe jump and cooking nad etc. On completion comes with achievements as an incentive to do them. <br>
<br>
Refine the bhop movement thought I would like to keep the movement as close to hl2dm it needs to be tweaked to seem smooth and natural to a first time user. For example the animation when you duck and jump is not smooth in hl2dm and may seem unnatural this is pov smoothness and model animation. Also the margin of error to start bhop would be increased to make it easier to learn the movement but how well you do the movement would determine how fast you go to make keep it skilled based.<br>
No tracking orbs. orbs will behave in the same way as crossbow bounce it will bounce off at the same angle it hit a surface this increase the skill that can be used for it. RPG would have two firing modes one is how we have it laser guided and two would be straight shot but one button will act for both so if you hold down the left mouse button its follow where your point let go of it will go in a straight line. I think this would be a interesting dynamic for this weapon. <br>
Thats what I have so far It’s unlikely there would be new hldm but we can dream can’t we so put down your ideas down who knows someone might see this and take on the ideas.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think if you could deflect the nad or rpg with your grav gun would be better like it would add another skill to the game you would have to know what range your grav gun would work and just the right angle to hit it to make it deflect just enuff to reduce damage most. That would actually provide a defence against a very powerfull weapon such as the rpg.   <br>
<br>
One other thing is that i would like is better net set up for the game. There would be UI for it that provides all the imprortant settings. As well I would make the game compatible with 100 tick servers trying to ensure that all players get the best hit reg possible for the net conncetion. Actauly would be nice if it was self adjusted for the particular server your on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yea i was more thinking of what they did with css im not to inffy with the name tho would be nice to have what they did with cs 1.6. Reason why i would not call it hl3dm is that half life does not redo stuff as said hl and hl2 and completely different and so any suggestion on here based on hl2dm would be pointless if you where to name it hl2dm. <br>
<br>
I guess we could try and come up with a decent name hl2 pro mod I don't like to much it not a focused product in my eyes and reminds me to much of quake with the Gauss gun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I know, slightly extreme bump, but I missed this topic before and feel the need to weigh in on it.<br>
<br>
for what it's worth, here are my suggestions for improving HL2DM:<br>
<br>
better netcode, better hitreg, fixed animations, no crashes or glitches, all that good stuff.<br>
<br>
no fucking jingle on the combine, and make their head hitboxes the same as rebels.  make the stunstick only a little more powerful than the crowbar, instead of twice as powerful, and just as fast or maybe just a little slower.  this will balance out rebel and combine once and for all and do away with pissy arguments about who's gonna be rebels or combine, since there will be little if any difference between the two.<br>
<br>
accept that bhopping is part of this game and include a comprehensive interactive in-game tutorial for it.  also include similar tutorials for other essential skills such as grav-nading, RPG curling, fast orbs, catching, and xbow banking.<br>
<br>
along those lines, make bhopping easier to do ffs.  it comes so naturally to us now that we forget just how complicated it actually is to a new player.  do away with the whole finger-twisting jump-crouch stuff and make it more like Quake bhopping, which is a hell of a lot easier on the fingers to do.  making bhop easier+a tutorial on it = no one bitching about bhop ever again.<br>
<br>
a better default config, FFS.  the default config sucks so bad that it is an inherent handicap for newer players who don't know how to change their config yet.<br>
make a single dot with no info brackets for the default crosshair.  include a default set of weapon bindings.  absolutely have fastswitch on by default.  <br>
default rates of 30000/66/66 instead of 10000/20/20 and an option for changing rates in the GUI.  making the default config better will both save trouble and eliminate more unnessecary learning curve.<br>
<br>
I disagree with allowing RPGs and SMG nades to be caught.  now that everyone knows how to catch thanks to the comprehensive catching tutorial outlined above, there needs to be at least a few weapons that can't be caught.  besides, catchable RPGs = less RPG curves = <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">.<br>
<br>
this one is not as important, but damn does this game ever need better moviemaking tools.  yes it's awesome that the game has a built-in recorder, that is very commendable, especially since there are not to my knowledge any even halfway decent third-party game recorders (ZDSoft might be a good one, haven't tried it yet but Fraps and Gamecam both blow).  but when compared with the moviemaking tools for Quake or even Halo 3 (yes I know its an Xbox game but its moviemaking tools are WAY better).  demo recording and recamming should work like Halo 3, a third person mode should be enabled all the time, and to move the camera you should just be able to click a button and move it with the arrow keys. no way in hell should anyone EVER have to wrestle with the demo smoother the way it is now, just because we're used to it doesn't make it right.  I mean, spline angles?  spline origin?  what the fuck does that even mean?<br>
<br>
make the Source Recorder less of a secret.  give it its own interface via unused keys on the number pad.  maybe KP_* to toggle moviemaking mode on and off (so you don't accidentally start recording a movie during a game for example), KP_+ to start recording, KP_- to stop recording, KP_1 to record at 30FPS, KP_2 to record at 60FPS, KP_3 to record at 90FPS, etc.  "BUT ZOMG I HAVE PHRASE BINDS ON THE KEYPAD!!11"  well, sorry man.  a few less phrase binds is definitely worth never seeing a HL2DM or Source movie done with FRAPS ever again. <br>
<br>
my (non movie-making) suggestions, in my opinion, are a good compromise between preserving the fast, fun, dynamic, and high-skilled gameplay we have come to know and love, and making it more accessible and newbie-friendly (which is in this community's best interest since newbs are the future of this game), which will increase numbers and help to keep the game alive.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i agree with most of these points. the one i deffinetly DONT agree with is making the bhop easier to do.  that is a skill, not a glitch.  my game was totally fucked up for weeks while i learned it.  and i only learned it from countless hours of practice, same with the nade catch(especially the left click catch).  when i first started learning the nade catch i was trying with the left click, and i thought to myself, this is impossible, cant be done. now i do it without even thinking about it.  same with yoyo.  all of these skills, IMO, should NOT be made easier to new comers.  i truly believe that those skills i aquired mean so much more to me knowing that i put the time and effort into getting them down pat.  it would piss me off to see noobs coming in and getting them right away because they altered the game to make it easier for them, they would not appreciate them as much, or appreciate the players that did take the time to learn them. the last thing this game needs is more wise ass punks that dont appreciate how open ended this game is, and the limitless possibilities of skill you can gain by practice.  handing them these skills on a silver platter will only catter to the spoiled nature of persons who have to have shit done for them.  hard work and practice will always produce better results then altering the game to those who dont want to do that.  <br>
<br>
i do agree with getting rid of the fucking jingle on combine. FFS. i cant believe one of us havent found away to do that yet.  its pretty much why everytime you play a scrim of 2v2 or more you have to play 2 rounds so both teams get comb once.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yea somewhat on the fence on the movement thing on one hand I would want everyone to know that the movement is part of the game and what techniques they can use to achieve it so that it can build a big player base. <br>
On other hand I would like to keep the movement to be a challenge and manual as possible not like quake or pro mode where most of the movement is done for you to make it easier.<br>
I think having training sessions with hints and tips will be very useful also mouse wheel <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> most of us use it anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This is what i would do (if i knew how to code):<br>
<br>
Revamp hl2mp from the ground up and create two modes of the game;<br>
<br>
Mode One - n00b firendly. altered keys OB netcode, so on so forth.<br>
Mode Two - Advanced. same keys. OB netcode only one that does not consider compensating high pings (and this comes me so mind the intention lol) = e.g. no lag compensation.<br>
<br>
The full Game Materials and IO Systems should take advantage of all OB games including the upcoming DM, DOD:S and CSS as well as include the complete old HL1 Materials (Materials here refers to both Textures and Models).<br>
<br>
The code i would have worked on would have been based on the work of HL2DMPRO and continue from there.<br>
<br>
The game comes with both Modes and sold as one game.<br>
<br>
This is daydreaming as i have no clue how to code of course. i was just enjoying writing this.<br>

<br>
Alright let's kick some ass:<br>
<br>
First, all credits go to my friend Montz (author) for make this happening, love ya bro.<br>
<br>
In case most of you didn't know, lawena recording tool is a popular and useful program in TF2 that allows you to record your frags in a MUCH EASIER WAY, and includes a lot of options like different resolutions, recording frame rates, skyboxes, etc. maybe you will say "yeah i can do all that stuff with my super extra 1337 movie config" but this tool is the most amazing thing ever.<br>
<br>
Now Montz (and well with a bit of my collaboration heh) made the same tool for HL2DM, actually it's in version 1.0, because we're still looking for bugs, improvements, etc. so if you guys have new ideas, suggestions, they're welcome.<br>
<br>
here are some things you can do:<br>
<br>
- select different screen resolutions<br>
- different recording frame rates<br>
- enable/disable motion blur<br>
- enable/disable crosshair<br>
- select different skybox textures<br>
- thirdperson view script (in testing process)<br>
- creating VDM files (i'll explain this later)<br>
<br>
and the most amazing feature is that once you recorded and closed the program, IT WON'T MODIFY YOUR MAIN GAMING CONFIGS!, making this tool usable even in your main account.<br>
<br>
so let's get started:<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 1:</span><br>
<strong class="text-strong">DOWNLOAD THE TOOL HERE -----&gt; </strong><a href="https://lawenarecordingtool-hl2dm-edition.googlecode.com/files/lawena%20Recording%20Tool%20-%20HL2DM%20Edition%20v1.rar" class="postlink">http://lawenarecordingtool-hl2dm-editio ... n%20v1.rar</a><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 2:</span><br>
<br>
Once you downloaded the program, extract the .rar file wherever you want (i recommend your desktop), and double click the folder inside.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 3:</span><br>
<br>
you'll get this:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/21kcin7.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
you have to doube click on the file "lwrthl2dm"<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 4:</span><br>
<br>
the first time you use the program, it will ask for 2 folders. one is the hl2dm directory and the other one is where you want your recorded frags (.tga images and .wav audio files), i suggest you yo create another folder named "footage" or "movie"<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 5:</span><br>
<br>
after that, you'll see the main program screen:<br>
<br>
<img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/2qsw42c.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
as you can see, it has a lot of options:<br>
<br>
- screen resolution: 1280x720 is the best for record<br>
- frame rate: from 60 to 3840 and custom frame rate (i use 300)<br>
- Quality: if you want a good looking footage, use "very high"<br>
- Viewmodel Fov: for now, this option is useless, needs to be fixed<br>
- Skybox: here is the cool part, you can preview a skybox from the list, if you like one, select it and it will replace the skybox in your demos (except the maps that use custom skybox like dm_lostarena)<br>
- disable/enable motion blur : disabled for moviemaking purposes<br>
- disable/enable crosshair: speaks for itself<br>
- disable steam cloud: leave as it<br>
<br>
if you want to save your settings for the next time you open the program, click on "save settings"<br>
Once you configured all your personal options, click on "start half-life 2 deathmatch" and it will launch hl2dm with the screen resolution you selected<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Step 6:</span><br>
<br>
in hl2dm, you just have to select a demo to play using the command "playdemo demoname" or pressing Shift+f2 to open the "demoui" control panel.<br>
<br>
if you want to record some frags, you have to press the "P" key to start recording, and "P" again if you want to stop.<br>
<br>
after you recorded your frags (.tga and .wav files), they will locate in the folder you selected previously, and they're ready to be open in Virtual Dub and later in any moviemaking program like Sony Vegas.<br>
if you want to clear the footage you have record, just click on "Clear Movie Folder"<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Advanced Controls:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Thirdperson Script:</span><br>
<br>
only works in POV demos (we will include the stv smooth script in future versions)<br>
<br>
by default, the tool doesn't enable sv_cheats 1 to use the thirdperson command, so you'll have to type "sv_cheats 1" in console.<br>
now all the magic goes to the numpad in your keyboard<br>
<br>
with the "+" and "-" keys. you switch between thirdperson and firstperson respectively<br>
with the numbers 1,2,3,4,,6,7,8,9 you can change the angles of the camera (180º, 90º, etc)<br>
with the number "5" you can change the zoom between the playermodel and the camera<br>
with the number "0" you change the command "cam_idealpitch" (use it carefully, it's a bit bugged...if you have problems type cam_idealpitch 0 in console)<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">VDM FILES:</span><br>
<br>
this is just amazing, imagine you have like 20 good frags in one demo, the recording process would be a pain in the ass. not anymore, the creation of VDM files simplify the way you record those frags.<br>
<br>

<br>
AND THAT'S IT!!, i hope you guys like this new program for hl2dm, and i hope there will not excuses to make good frag movies. again i thanks Montz for all the job he did.<br>
<br>

<br>
Less dynamic movement sucked any kind of entertainment out of watching hl2dm demos. <br>
<br>
Valve's game is only for careless pubs now. I will attempt to use it in ag2, though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote><div><cite>Pernicious wrote:</cite>Aim-sticking?</div></blockquote>
This exert is taken from my games' concept paper... <br>
It is just from the Deathmatch (Dominus) part of the game. The entire thing will be like a fucking 200 pages when I am done... <br>
<br>
Good thing I am long winded and pendantic - like this very post! XD <br>
<br>
This is where I am discussing the three types of players in my DM style game: Sticking, Sweeping, Spamming. <br>
Sweeping has all but been removed from Valve DM. So sad.
<blockquote><div><cite>Newguy's Thesis on DM shit wrote:</cite><strong class="text-strong">Sticking</strong>: Players who “stick” generally wish to see combat be as slow and simple as possible as they rely on baseball-like hand-eye coordination in order to aim at opponents while attempting to control the conditions of combat by not moving a lot; by reducing their own bilateral or "foot" movement, sticking players attempt to keep combat as optimal/simple as it can be in order to land as many successful hits as possible, with the majority of those hits coming from precision hit_scan weapons. Sticking players in FPS games such as <em class="text-italics">Quake 3</em> and <em class="text-italics">Counter-Strike</em> are notorious for setting their visual/video settings at the very lowest/least-detailed possible and usually prefer a low pixel-display resolution such as 800x600x16 in order to tune out all “distractions.” These types of players are focusing primarily on aim and prefer a 4:3 aspect ratio in order to "keep all action in front of them." Sticking players put a paramount emphasis on “standing and shooting” percentage. In <em class="text-italics">Dominus</em> the sticking strategy is still present and valid but has undergone some defamation in comparison to all other FPS games. Because of the inherent “spawning parity” invoked by players automatically having 3 e_nades, known aesthetically as Energy Grenades, sticking players are not simply going “shot-for-shot” with other players, for they must address the 3-second fuse and perceptive capability of the person throwing the grenade. The sticking player must know how to catch another player’s e_nade, and this combat model resembles more of a Quarterback being under pressure than a “sniper vs. sniper” combat style. Aside from that, sticking players must also account for the very fast and elliptical combat that is the staple feature of <em class="text-italics">Dominus</em>; many times during combat, players lose sight of one another and must listen, judge, perceive, or even posses precognitive attributes in order to set-up and land shots that may require 180 degree FOV or “head” movement. Still, players who have excellent standing aim of precision hit_scan and precision e_projectile weapons will enjoy a great deal of success in <em class="text-italics">Dominus</em>.</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I'll start - he's been playing this game for 3 years and all he's ever done is (1) play in pubs shooting noobs who can't bunnyhop and (2) get banned from everything ever. I think we can all agree he's going to get banned from eFPS too as soon as that starts. If he's not caught hacking, he'll just call everyone a negro and then RQ.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Great, I was going to chew fearsome out (if he responded to me calling him ugly, which he didn't) for always hatin' on the eFPS admins and having this "I'm more intelligent, upscale, and sophisticated" attitude towards you all, but wow, why the fuck should I? <br>
<br>
It seems you get as dumb, butthurt, and childish as he does when you lose.   <br>
<br>
Valiums sometimes gets angry when he (rarely) does poorly playing agianst me, but wow. <br>
<br>
Ugh, nevermind, I am over it. <br>
Fear is still a bigger pertinacious cunt.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe you should start playing with guys like Nutri-Grain more to get better, or better yet, stop caring.<br>
The biggest flaw of CAL was admins either having an ego/self-absorbed attitude or pandering to someone else's and causing a delay. <br>

	<div class="content">Fine, here's the update on eFPS. <br>
<br>
In May, I had this great idea for a website. It would have skins, maps, news, forums, blah blah leagues blah blah would be awesome. BuckyKatt said he would do all the coding for free, sharing profits down the middle. I would provide the content and get things done. So I spent hundreds of hours over the summer collecting 15gb of maps and skins, talking to people, renting servers, hosting a summer tournament to get interest going, buying a domain, renting a web host...the list goes on. I did all this out of my own money, believing that Bucky would come through on his end. We talked throughout the summer about the site - he told me his progress and I told him mine. He showed me a semi-functional mock-up of how the site would look. We discussed running the business, the process of incorporating into a limited liability corporation, and what our projected revenues would be vs. our projected operating costs. <br>
<br>
Four weeks ago, Bucky and I planned to meet up for the first time to talk about the site in person and get to know each other face to face. He agreed to drive about an hour and a half up to where I live for beers. The day we were supposed to meet up came...and went. I called him and sent him messages on Facebook. He has not responded to any of them. He has been on Steam several times in the last month, but has signed off almost immediately. It's likely he is simply setting his friend status to offline mode as soon as he signs on. <br>
<br>
In my phone message to him, I just asked him give me the source code to the site so someone else could work on it. He still hasn't gotten back to me about any of it. <br>
<br>
So, to everyone who is impatient or upset that the site isn't here yet - sorry. I spent my entire summer trying to accomplish a big goal. I believed in the goal and I worked toward it. I thought I had someone on board who believed in the goal as well. But he disappeared overnight and doesn't apparently care enough to take 3 minutes to call me and tell me what's up. So that's the update. Moral of the story - its easy for people on the internet to not give a shit about you when it actually counts.<br>
<br>
I would file a lawsuit to recover the source code, but it's unlikely that I would win. We didn't incorporate, he didn't sign anything, and all I have is the memory of how our (many) conversations went about the site. I trusted Bucky because we have played together since 2005. I know his name and I'm friends with him and his wife on Facebook. Basically, I know Bucky as well as you can know somebody through the internet. But, my trust was still apparently misplaced.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I cordially dislike this point of view and i always have. The Internet is very real and is a mean of communication between real live human beings. the fact that some real live human beings prefer hiding behind the internet's seemingly impersonal nature is the same in my eyes as one hiding behind anything else in real life; be it status, words and titles or possessions.<br>
I've made life long friends through the Internet as well as lucked on assholes. I could contact a real live person for a job or collaboration in real live and they could disappear come money time. It's happened before and will probably happen again. It happens and people are people.<br>
I don't disagree that the method of communicating through the internet is (as it should be) somewhat different than the personal one but not in any way different than corresponding through writing a letter and should involve the same commitment and civility. It definitely does not warrant a change in intentions or expectation. I put it all down to the fact the Internet is still in its diapers and perceived in the wrong way by many.<br>
Perhaps the best example i could give is that - On my part, Para, you and I are friends. and you're real enough for me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">To be fair, coding a new site from scratch for all this content by one programmer, in his spare time is not going to take just a few months.  There's too much work there, maybe if he was able to do it all as a main job.  He already is swamped with his main job and he's got a wife; the max I see him being able to spend on it a day is 3-4 hours, if that.  I honestly doubt even that.<br>
<br>
That doesn't excuse the disconnect on communication, that's the shitty part.<br>

If you were ramping up the pressure, it all might have gotten to him.  There's a lot of work there, again.  Doesn't happen in a day or a few months.  Maybe he just said "Fuck it."  He realized more and more how much work was going to be on him.<br>
<br>
Then again, Bucky doesn't seem like the type to do that.  I think he's gotten more busy with other work and is "suspending it" for now, or at least taking a break.  If he is calling it quits and severing communication, well that blows.  But he can't "hide" away forever.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah it the website you are describing is an absolutely huge undertaking, particularly for one person alone.  You really need a team of at least 4 - 6 collaborating all the time with each guy doing his own part of the project.  I would definately take more than 3-4 months to code it with even a team of 4.  <br>
<br>
The people that were trying to form a league to replace CAL (also the people willing to have an HL2DM league be part of it) ran into the same problem: no coders willing to step up to do the work of making a league anticheat and website with front pages for the teams and back pages for the admins, etc, etc.  I kinda looked into doing it myself once but came to the conclusion that I dont know enough about coding and to learn what I needed to know would take a long while before I even got to doing the whole website itself.<br>
<br>
@ Valar.  I dont adhere to that point of view, but it unfortunately does seem to be the more popular point of view among many on the internet.   I don't readily trust people I know only through the internet anymore, because sooner or later most of them stab you in the back anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Anyone got an estimate on what someone would want to code a website? I'd just take my eFPS donation I was going to give you and put it into paying someone + some more. Or workout a dual plan like take percentage of profits plus money.<br>

Sigh.  My immediate reaction to this is "Fuck Off" but in truth I actually feel bad for leaving Holy in the lurch.  But I did have a good reason.<br>
<br>
A few months ago I started having heart problems.  Skipping beats (Premature ventricular contraction, average 5000+ a day) which would be followed by a rapid heart beat (160 BPM while at rest) known as supraventricular tachycardia (as opposed to the more deadly ventricular tachycardia).  I have pretty much spent the last few months in a anxiety ridden state fearful that any day may be my last day while doctors do tests trying to get a handle on what might be going on all the while telling me that despite what I was feeling in my chest that I had nothing to be concerned about.<br>
<br>
I withdrew from any real form of social interaction and spent all my free time with my wife because being with her is more important to me than any website or playing any video game.<br>
<br>
It probably would have been better if I had just handed Holy the source code though I am doubtful he would have been able to do much with it.  Further, as Holy pointed out we hadn't signed anything and while I do trust Holy I am not inclined to give my work away with no assurance as to what will happen to it and what my role would be.  I honestly figured if the heart thing resolved itself then I would resume working on it and if it didn't, well, I probably wouldn't be around to care.<br>
<br>
In the end the only thing the doctors could find was that I have mild mitral valve prolapse with minimal mitral regurgitation which doesn't really explain what I went through.  The current best guess was that I was simply pushing to hard.  My stress load was too high between my regular job, eFPS, and normal life events.  I wasn't sleeping enough and was consuming way to much caffeine.  All of which made a rather benign condition into something very terrifying.<br>
<br>
The SVT has gone away and while I still have occasional PVCs it appears that they are subsiding as well with the beta blocker I have been put on.  I still have anxiety attacks but am resisting any of the drugs for that in favor of trying to relieving my anxiety more naturally though exercise and meditation.<br>
<br>
I am glad to see that Holy (and company) managed to get something up for eFPS.  I may eventually return to working on the source code I have.  For eFPS to be truly manageable it needs a real backend that ties everything together.  I have a fair piece of that done and would like to see it come to fruition.  But it will happen on my own terms.  No more days with only 3 hours sleep and 2 liters of Mt Dew drunk for weeks on end.<br>
<br>
Anyways... I really do regret leaving Holy in the state that I did and hope he understands why I did.<br>
<br>
Bucky<br>
<br>
P.S. I now have a solid loathing for the practice of "lets schedule for this test in two weeks... complete test... we will get you your results in two weeks... here are your results... lets schedule this other test for two weeks..."  Give me all the fucking tests now, give me my results as fast as possible and lets get this nipped in the bud before the anxiety causes me to have a damn heart attack.  And I even have really good insurance through work.  Fuck.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm sorry to hear this Bucky, but I'm glad you're doing better now.  I don't blame you for that initial reaction of "Fuck off," the things people were saying didn't even sound like you to me.  I'm glad you're still here with us and okay, you've always been one of the more amazing people I've ever had the pleasure of talking to.<br>
<br>
Yes, eFPS has finally gotten off the ground.  But if anyone wants to see this thing grow, you will have to have a very rock-solid foundation, a good framework.  It's harder to bring that framework in later after all the existing data for tournaments exists, but it can be done.<br>
<br>
Take it easy, get those runs in or biking or whatever it is you do for exercise.  It amazes me how much it really does help.  If you don't have your health, you don't have anything.  It's misery, so take care of yourself.  Easier said than done.<br>
<br>
The problem is, too many obligations, too many people pushing.  And something secondary to your normal day-to-day job, like eFPS has to take time, something can't be expected to be completed in simply months in spare time, at least nothing of quality by one sole person.  It's a lot of pressure when everyone "misleadingly" believes that it will become completed in just a few months, when you have bigger, grander plans to make it something of quality, and not something you want to scrap 2 weeks later.<br>
<br>
Anyway take care.<br>

I honestly figured if the heart thing resolved itself then I would resume working on it and if it didn't, well, I probably wouldn't be around to care.<br>
<br>
In the end the only thing the doctors could find was that I have mild mitral valve prolapse with minimal mitral regurgitation which doesn't really explain what I went through.  The current best guess was that I was simply pushing to hard.  My stress load was too high between my regular job, eFPS, and normal life events.  I wasn't sleeping enough and was consuming way to much caffeine.  All of which made a rather benign condition into something very terrifying.<br>
<br>
The SVT has gone away and while I still have occasional PVCs it appears that they are subsiding as well with the beta blocker I have been put on.  I still have anxiety attacks but am resisting any of the drugs for that in favor of trying to relieving my anxiety more naturally though exercise and meditation.<br>
<br>
I am glad to see that Holy (and company) managed to get something up for eFPS.  I may eventually return to working on the source code I have.  For eFPS to be truly manageable it needs a real backend that ties everything together.  I have a fair piece of that done and would like to see it come to fruition.  But it will happen on my own terms.  No more days with only 3 hours sleep and 2 liters of Mt Dew drunk for weeks on end.<br>
<br>
Anyways... I really do regret leaving Holy in the state that I did and hope he understands why I did.<br>

	<div class="content">Heh... that picture is more accurate than one may guess.  While I never had the pain that a heart attack is supposed to entail I did walk around a lot with my hand clutched to my chest.  Having your heart skip multiple beats every minute is unsettling but oddly fascinating so I spent a lot of time counting my heart beat.<br>

	<div class="content">I once had something similar experience.   Stress at work came to a head one day and caused me to have some heart palpatations.  It only lasted a few minutes but it was scary as hell.  That was the day I decided I needed to find another job because it just wasnt worth it any more.   I can imagine having something similar happening for days can be downright terrifying.  <br>
<br>
The bottom line that an online game, a website, job, basically NOTHING is worth your life or your family.  efps and HL2DM can wait Bucky, you need to take care of yourself now and get better then go ahead at a slower, more managable pace.  I dont think anyone can really blame you for what you did.<br>

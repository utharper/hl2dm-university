	<div class="content">mine seems to vary in different games sometimes i can do 470-490 no problem but sometimes on a crap day i do 410-440 but i do notice that my connection is bad to the server when that happens like a jumping choke of 10 or my fps suddenly dropping from 160 to 30. <br>
<br>
As what has been said already focus on the first jump and get it right like getting a nice smooth curv also i find pressing hard on the strafe key and as well doing a S movement in the air with the mouse and strafe keys not sure what we call that tho. maybe if u can get allot of speed on the start of the first jump then work on air control to maintain that vel. Using mag surf map has helped me with this so start the map and change air acceleration to let say 60-80 for starters then every time u complete it drop the airacceration by 10 or 5 and keep doing it until u reach down to 35-25. 25 in the smallest i can do. reason why this helps with maintaining a high speed u have to generate vel and keep it with little airacceration the harder it is the maintain a high vel and so helps u focus on your mouse movement in the air with the right combination of strafe keys.<br>

average? no idea, I don't really pay attention - if I feel like I need to be moving faster/slower due to how the match is going, then I do that. as long as you can maintain 450-470 for 2-3 hops, then you are fine (sprint regens and can redo it by then)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

But have a go at the map it can be a pain at first but it trains u to improve your air control and as well get u out bad habits that slow down the bhop such as pressing the forward key in the air. Then when u done enuff of that trying doing laps around lost with out stopping and see how fast u go.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I still can't seem to master alternating the strafe keys between hops... which seems to be where true speed is generated.  So my best speeds actually come from curving right or left around corners.<br>

first jump is the fastest after that it lowers and plateaus the only time the strafe speeds you up is in low grav<br>
but the first jump does involve a lot of strafing its the alternation that maintains it</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah I dont pay much attention to my speed. It fluctuates so much in any hop anyways its not even worth trying to average it out. when i hit the ground in my fastest of bhops it'll say 490 or something but when i jump again im at like 520+. Then coming back down it drops again so who really knows how fast you're actually going. I dont worry about my velocity so much in matches, especially team games. If my mates need me, I go as fast as I can, If we're in control of the map and im playing it safe, You wont see me bhop at all.<br>
<br>
I suggest that when people practice their bhop, they dont CONSTANTLY try to bunnyhop. You gotta refrain yourself from trying to move all over the map at the fastest pace possible. I typically only do that when Im rushing or powering up.<br>
<br>
Also, I use both mwheeldown and space as jump. With space I could probably get 400-450 on average (thats the velocity when i hit the ground, not in the air) and with mwheeldown its about 100 velocity faster</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

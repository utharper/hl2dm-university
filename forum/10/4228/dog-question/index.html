No cuts, not stuff in there? probably allergies, soak the paws, make sure they are nice an dry, do this regularity to wash the stuff that is giving her allergies, then pop a Benadryl into her at night to relieve the itching. Not a cure but if she is just sensitive, she is just sensitive <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> gl</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">when my dogs do that, they have a foxtail stuck in between the toes and you really cant see it as it goes under the skin. Usually it will work its way out with the chewing and what not, but you really need to keep an eye on it as it can get infected. If it gets infected your looking at some major bucks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

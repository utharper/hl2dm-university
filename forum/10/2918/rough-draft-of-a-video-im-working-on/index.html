If this link doesnt work let me know. The ultimate goal of my project is to promote the game and get people interested. The footage you see here is just some crap i pulled from a quick game and is by no means the finished product. I just wanted to throw out the concept and slowmo Idea. I had never played the map nor the people. I believe someone wanted a video of my gameplay style so here it is. Keep in mind I was working with over 80ms ) also most of the finer details I was hoping to capture got lost in YOUTUBES quality.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Bind to whatever your most comfortable to you and with keys as close as possible to your fingers.<br>
<br>
For me I use:<br>
<br>
F for crossbow<br>
C for grenade <br>
X for the 357 mag<br>
V for the shotgun<br>
G for the RPG<br>
MOUSE5 for gravity gun (the side botton on your mouse depending on the mouse you have ) I use a mx518 from logitec and a Razer DeathAdder.<br>
MOUSE4 (another side botton on the mouse ) for SMG<br>
"1" for stun stick/crowbar <br>
SPACE and mousewheeldown for jump<br>
<br>
<br>
I suggest you make an autoexec.cfg to save all your settings, that way if you crash/reinstall you dont lose your settings.<br>
<br>
you can learn how to do that here:  <a href="http://hl2dm-university.com/hl2dm_102.php" class="postlink">http://hl2dm-university.com/hl2dm_102.php</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As apposed to showing how amazing the player is ( as most "frag" vids do)  I chose to take elements from the game and pointed out some cool shit that took place. There were other posts in this forum about getting people interested in the game and I think taking those fast elements and slowing them down is pretty cool. As I said this is a very rough draft and only showing scenes from that one map I've never played.<br>
Is it full of a bunch of shit no one ever wants to see? AM I A FOOL FOR CREATING IT!? <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> You tell me.

If this link doesnt work let me know. The ultimate goal of my project is to promote the game and get people interested. The footage you see here is just some crap i pulled from a quick game and is by no means the finished product. I just wanted to throw out the concept and slowmo Idea. I had never played the map nor the people. I believe someone wanted a video of my gameplay style so here it is. Keep in mind I was working with over 80ms ) also most of the finer details I was hoping to capture got lost in YOUTUBES quality.</div></blockquote>

<br>
is this your first vid?<br>
<br>
and if so you done good but maybe keep them shorter<br>
and try to edit out the real shaky/jerky footage.<br>

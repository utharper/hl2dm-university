	<div class="content">meh, I admit I love wheeling. <br>
<br>
I learned the right way by using space, but one day some one talked me into trying the wheel and uh I'm never going back. <br>
<br>
I will tell you this and it's a fact, spamming it or not you cannot get the timing as perfect as you can by doing it with space, therefore someone who wheels will not be able to get the timing *perfect* and therefore will not move as fast as someone who does it with a button and has awesome timing. <br>
<br>
So in reality the players who choose to wheel are at a slight disadvantage when it comes to speed. So you may ask "why do it then?" my answer is simple, its very comfortable and less stressful on your hand and wrist. I found that when you play for extended periods of time you are using your thumb more so than any other finger (due to bhopping)  and after a hour or so your thumb gets tired and your jumps can become sloppy and mistimed. Rolling the wheel just takes less effort thats all. <br>
<br>
I would have to agree that macros are lame, as your more or less scripting when you use a macro, but using the wheel really isn't any different than using any other button.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Warsow does not require any timing. You press jump before you hit the ground and you automatically jump on the first frame the server detects you as being on the ground. AFAIK it is just like quake. In fact nearly every game out there does this except goofy half-life. This is how it should be if you are going to include bunnyhopping it sets everything fair so that no script or anything will give another player an advantage. <br>
<br>
How smooth or fast you bunnyhop will depend on how fast you scroll the wheel. I think you can easily go as fast or faster then anyone can ever do it with space if you have a good wheel. Try one of those wheels on the wireless VX series mice. <br>
<br>
In the old days of Doom arrow keys were the default setup as such a large number of players use them. Newer players tend to use whatever the default in their first game is. And everyone once in a while some odd ball just makes up their own really crazy config. Alot of times though its a combination of effects that finalizes a config. <br>
<br>
I use the mouse wheel, the reason I started using it was cause in HLDM nearly everyone used a script, and if you wanted to compete your only choice was to use the mouse wheel. When you use the mouse wheel you do cause yourself some pains in that aiming is slightly more difficult and you make a couple more mistakes per match. I used to use both space and mouse wheel and that was the best but when I thought I might make the FIOS tournament I reduced it to one to be LAN legal. If you only use 2 fingers to mouse then one of them will be busy jumping, or you can use 3 like me to free one up. The mouse wheel has one other advantage, that is that it can pull your through the effects of lag. How well you time your jumping depends on the server, if you are like me and play in anything from 10 ping up to 200 ping in South America or Europe, and everything in between you can use the mouse wheel to be a buffer that lets you play in all those environments. That said I bet their are other options, like autoscroll buttons and insert keys can probably allow you to bunny hop simply by holding down the key, and we know those guys with logitech G15 keyboards can program buttons to auto repeat. <br>
<br>
I don't know if it is lame or not, the only thing I think is lame is that valve just does not remove the line of code that will make jumping more like quake so none of us have to worry about timing and who has what advantage or is doing what lame. And it's lame that if they really don't want people to jump like quake that they do not put in a real limit as to how fast you can press the jump key so you are forced to time it. Bad coding is the main cause behind controversy in games. If the game is coded right no one can find a loop hole around things.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

IDK, maybe it's just me then but I have done quite a bit of testing ( on mx518, G5, and razors) such as setting the scroll size to anywhere between 1 line to 100 lines per click as well as spinning the wheel very fast, medium and slow. I still see that I can gain more speed by using the space and timing it just right.<br>
<br>
The one thing I have noticed is that sometimes you can avoid fall damage by spamming the wheel right when you hit the ground. You'll notice that you take off like a rocket when you do that and no damage is taken, but just like most things in this game it's not consistent.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, I am on the other side of the spectrum of hand size, I have very small hands. I have been asking a lot of people where they set they movement keys in particular jump and crouch because I am having a HELL of a time with a strafe jump, I had heard about the wheel and for me that would just be practically impossible to hit it with a good pace for Bhop, which  I am just trying to get comfortable here. Nade has been teaching me the jumps and I was able to actually jump for the first time but when it comes to strafe jumping I hit A WALL, can't do the 4 buttons. When I asked Nade about the scroll wheel, he was just laughing at me (well he kinda does that a lot) but because I have done it the wrong way  once (I am now paying for it by switching hands) I suggest trying to do it whichever way works for you. I can see some of the guys points, you have to make the equipment work for you, for your size, for your situation BUT this where the line gets fuzzy right?. If valve would at least make some type of policy and not leave us guessing to the order of "If they think it is, they would" perhaps we could have a clearer idea of what is right or wrong. <br>

That's what I get out of it anyways.  Going from scroll to normal I think would be hard xD  So I say try normal first, then scroll, then see which is easier for ya, it just sounds too weird for me, jumping on the right side of my desk?  YUCK.<br>

	<div class="content">@ POMP  Like Coke said I would highly suggest that you learn it default/or very close to default, before you mess around with any of the odder ways of bhopping.  It took me a couple of weeks if not a month when I was first learning to really start to be comfortable with my bhop in game situations.  So percervierence is paramount, it will come with time and it feels so good once you start to get it.  Its time well spent, trust me. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
<br>
I personally have never liked the idea of movement stuff on my mouse, it just seems <em class="text-italics">really</em> weird to me.  I've never had a reason to try it either so I never considered it until I heard people debating it in-game.  I think if you practice enough and you make sure your left arm/hand are in a good ergonomic position getting a tired hand or thumb shouldn't happen.  I've only been back playing for a little over a month and I've logged sessions of 10+hrs without tiring or experiencing fatigue great enough to effect my bhop timing. I believe this is due to the fact that I spent some time to figure out the most ergonomic way that I caould layout my setup.  And it works I'm always comfortable, no more cramps, no more loss of feeling in my fingers, no more symptoms of carpal tunnel, I don't feel any discomfort even after excessively long sessions with the way I have everything setup.  So if bhopping with deafault key cfg is unncomfortable or even painful to some people look into ergonomics, small changes in positioning and posture can make a huge difference.  Like the difference between having carpal tunnel and a healthy wrist.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Check back with me when your 40 and you have been doing it everyday for 15 yrs!<br>
<br>
I have in the past experienced problems with my wrists, ligaments, tendons and carpal tunnels, but I love gaming ( I don't let it rule my life ) but when I get the chances I game for a hour or two each day, it's a great escape from life's daily stresses.<br>
<br>
I agree you should learn the fundamentals first, then try different things to see whats most comfortable. To say everyone should start off with the default cfg is a different story. In every game I have ever played the first thing I have done is change the controls. I never played hl2dm with wasd or any game for that matter, as I knew how to type properly first and it just makes sense to me to use a esdf set up.<br>
<br>
The fact that since day one Valve gave us the ability to bind jump to mousewheel down in the GUI, make this whole topic a moot point and a matter of opinion on who's cfg (set up) is better than another's. I mean seriously, just because Seagull made like the first tutorial on how to bhop, using wasd, does not mean that is the way it has to be done or your lame.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The downside is it is probably harder to shoot whilst bunnyhopping using this technique<br>
both ways have their Pros and cons.<br>
By the way if you spin the wheel too fast nothign happens, I have a G9 and set the wheel on free wheel but it only registers when it starts to slow down however using the freewheel in firefox works flawlessly.<br>
Some games dont allow binding the wheel to jump like quake 4 i have to play using space but then again Q4 bhop is easy compared to HL2DM</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

had a feeling someone would bring up scripting when i said that first part. <br>
well I do have a problem with this since that using something in a way that was not provided in the game that gives u a advantage over your opponent example turning one key to do two action to reduce amount of actions to do a movement is lame. <br>
Since the game provides u to choose your key setup to suit around u then how can u say customizing your controls as being lame not everyone is the same ( I know a guy that has his forward button on his mouse button 4) and what ever key setup helps them best then whats a the problem with that u have that option too. Just because u choose not to and others do does not make them lame. I spent along time to developing my bhop and for anyone to say that my method is lame is a insult to be honest and I went throe just like any another player that can do bhop the pain of learning this technique. <br>

I know plenty of pro players that use it so i guess they are lame as well then?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you make something stupid like the timing of a jump a crucial item you do 2 negative things to the game. 1 you punish people with high ping or even those like I said who play on a variety of servers. Second people focus more on that skill and less on others. Do you really want everyone screwing around all day with the timing of a jump or would you rather give them the time to advance skills that will be more interesting such as mastering 10 bounce xbow shots. To me if I am making a game I would rather have them focusing on map and weapon mastery.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol when did pro players in this game get paid :0 it they do i would like to know lol <br>
<br>
sure timing skill i got respect for that. I actually am able to use space bar as duck for bhop but I noticed that it did not help me when im in a fight with someone, like I do my strafe jump and someone hits he with a mag or shotty i loss momentum and is an unable to continue my bhop and because im so busy shotting at this guy i can't consecrate on getting my timing right and is unable to bhop , making me stand there like a easy target for them. <br>
My clan captain told me to change to scroll and with that my other parts of the game got better i could have a mag fight move freely and focus on my aim and my surroundings. I know that space bar might be good for faster bhop but i can do 480-490 and thats because i don't spam my wheel and still time it like i did with the space bar and that I just find that it more flexible than spacebar. <br>
<br>
at the end of the day i want to focus on getting the kill and staying alive and not worry about timing my bhop it may be the easy way but it allows me to focus on more interesting and important aspects of the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i use both mwheeldown and space. I never could use space for all of my DM years since quake 2. I always used mouse 2 for jump. Well low and behold hl2dm has alt fire! yay! Since I started hl2dm I've been through about 5 different movement configs alone.<br>

Anyways, I used to think scrolling jump was lame and all that. I eventually adapted to it and found myself bhopping faster than I ever could. I just recently started using space as jump and I'm really trying to make a transfer to use just space but mwheeldown is still my backup.<br>

For the record: If you do it right, you'll definately move faster with mwheeldown rather than space. I dont care what anyone says.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I got a question if u use the default set up then two of your fingers have two tasks to do each where as with the wheel only one finger has two buttons to press WS.

Thats a other reason why most use wheel because they find it easier to multi task on the mouse leaving my other hand to rest in a conformable position on the key board. <br>

I personally think concentrating on your mouse curv and alternating between A &amp; D which requires timing is more important than the timing of the just the jump.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As would i. Its unfortunate that the wheel is able to basically emulate a macro in this game, but nevertheless i dont see wheeling as lame, as the mousewheel is pretty much an accepted staple in gaming now... and accordingly we can expect to see it used in competitive play until the mouse itself becomes obsolete.<br>

To go one step further, if the only way to BHOP was by spamming jump, I'm quite sure you wouldn't have any problems with wheeling at all.<br>
<br>
I will also say it has been quite interesting to see how many well known players have responded and have had the balls to admit they use the wheel, its starting to sound like the non wheelers are in the minority.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I say try out the default see how it feels then try tweak your key config to suit around u and if wheel suits u then use it don't feel that you u are dirty or lame for using it many top players use it because it a damn good tool to use and as ko-toe has said it it expected in competitive gaming so there for it is not lame. <br>

Btw, a similar arguement has been going on for years in the fighter community.

	<div class="content">Well I believe many would say to do bhop with a button or wheel requires allot skill if it did not then why did it take some to learn the technique more then 2 months I emphases the word learn not perfect. Its not the argument that wheel takes out the skill of the movement because the main important aspects of bhop is the curv and strafe keys timing still has to be done and as i said to do the bhop well u still have to time the jumps even with the wheel and if u just spam it u don't get anywhere fast. Its really a insult of intelligence to say to someone that uses there head and finds a way that makes makes bhop work for them less error free way that does not involve scrips or cheats. Its like saying to the guy that invented the wheel that there way is lame since that it takes out the effort in walking or even running com on that it self is lame. Just because players find a legit method in doing a techniques that is not same as your does not make it lame. If i used the buttons for my bhop i doubt i will be able to bhop on your US servers with my 110+ ping. Not everyone is the same and it would be wrong to expect everyone to do things in the same way.  <br>
<br>
I do agree with ko-toe on that games should not have to be dumbed down for the masses. Have any of u came across pro mod its a great game but one think i don't like about it is it does most bhop for u taken the fun out of learning it pls i can bhop with better moves on dm.

Another thing to note wen talking about wheeling jump is how the scroller is set up, if its set up to scroll through more pages in windows, or in the software for said mouse, then the more it is going to spam jump.

Well I don't use it, so I am just trying to understand. I didn't think scrolling helped you strafe jump, only overbounce. Isn't scrolling the first jump hard to time???</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ha thats funny I was thinking the exact same thing, it would be a fun little contest for people to pit there movement skills against each other. Either make it some kind of flatgrass type map with no obstacles and then one thats like a obstacle course. <br>

Overbounce used to be a term for falling from x height, hitting the ground, then bouncing right back up to that same height again, there are up/ and forward types of overbounce (depending on what you're playing, could be 360 degrees), however it's meaning (like all used words) has been changed over the years, in Hl2dm overbouncing is getting that jump you want in as quickly as possible when you hit the ground (it would appear as if you didn't even touch (or feel) the ground, rather right above it). <br>
<br>
Basically: The more a skipping rock touches the water, the faster it will slow down, and the less it touches the water, the further it will go, in more duration.  And since you're commanding the rock, you're gonna wanna duck all the time, and jump accordingly.  One thing that helps getting more jumps in is keeping an eye on the horizontal plane of the map, in relation to your own position in the air.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Bunnyhopping in my mind consists of three things, strafe jump, overbounce and air control. Overbounce is the hop you do on first landing and thereafter until you strafe jump again.<br>

I have heard people say that is the incorrect use of the term...but to them I say pfff. Jargon is context specific and is defined by common usage. In the context of HL2DM, this is what overbounce means.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

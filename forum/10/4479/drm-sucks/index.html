Its uncalled for.<br>
And of course it pisses you off.<br>
You should be able to play that game immediately.<br>

EA should try harder. There has to be a balance between protecting folks investments and livliehood and this shit.<br>
Really, you COULD blame it on thieves.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think they do this with all of the downloadables that arent a true steam game (ie Valve).  They just want to make sure you have a legitimate copy that you paid for.  Yea its a pain in the ass to have to save the emails for all the games you buy over the download service.  Honestly I cant blame them for wanting a key typed in for a new install.  Not sure how easy it is give them a fake CD key code and get away with it.  I never personally tried.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sorry to hear about your troubles Keefy.  <br>
<br>
In CoD-WaW you MUST BE ONLINE to play any style MP game.  Even when trying to host a lan game. The game requires you to be online to to verify your copy is legit.  Me and a friend have been trying to LAN nazi zombies forever, where we play there is no internet access.<br>
<br>
Whats worse about it, is it lets you host the LAN lobby, the friend can join, but he never loads through getting a 'Servery synchronization Error".   I was in contact with Activison support for 2 weeks with this issue and they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't work.  Tried all sorts of stuff to no avail.<br>
<br>
The last email Tarik Obama Bin Laden sent me said roughly "You must be online to host co-op LAN games to verify your account with the master server".   I responded with a couple more questions and they never got back to me on it.  Then 48hours later I got an email stating my case had been resolved.  Great support!!  <br>
<br>
then they released patch 1.6 and I thought 'oh shit, maybe....just maybe'  drove 23 miles to my friends house to test it out --- nope.<br>
<br>
We have played together, when he comes to my house so we can use the internet.  Regardless of hosting 'Online' or hosting 'LAN' - we've never had an issue getting the game to synch/play when interweb is connected.<br>
<br>
Why they even give you a LAN option I have no idea, since you need to be online - you just click 'host online' instead of 'host lan'.   <br>
Even more stupid is the fact when hosting LAN, people can still join the friggin Lobby, regardless of where they are.  <br>
DRM = consumer headaches.<br>
<br>
Also, I had a similar issue with crysis, not uninstalling it first before a re-format.  When I went to reinstall it denied me.  So I said F-it.  Single player was boring and MP has no players (vanilla crysis) and didn't pursue the issue.  However, have x amount of time it did allow me to reinstall it for whatever reason.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">so, if anyone knows how to LAN <br>
CoD-WaW in offline mode please share your info.  The first 10 pages of Google search are pretty useless, especially since 3/4 of the shit pertains to xbox/ps3.<br>
<br>
oh yeah, the only thing you can do in OFFLINE mode that I found, was creating a Listen Server through the MP.exe  <br>
He can join those games fine, but you cannot switch it to nazi_zombie games through console or in-game voting options.  <br>

Whee.  lets 1v1 on a 36 person map!!! fun fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">†h3 Nèw Ġuy`: What I had to say after Learning I was banned =<br>
<br>
If I am given the chance, I can apologize.<br>
&gt;&gt;Impala and I worked things out, through steam chat. Just recently.<br>
&gt;&gt;Valar and I will probably never get along, as well as Paradox and I.<br>
<br>
I was, in fact, going to honor that promise I made WT, but Impala misunderstood some stuff I said (video I posted) and so I in turn posted (flamed) stuff publicly - because Impala said I was scheming or something. Using the behind the scenes stuff to further a private agenda or some-crap (referring to the pm's I was exchanging w/ WT, I think). So I made the mistake he did, I publicly flamed on a thread that should have had none of it (sorry nino).<br>
But Impala and I came to an understanding later.<br>
<br>
As for the crap I said to Valar, I meant every word. <br>
So that will probably keep me banned, but w/e, <br>
I will publicly apologize and change me ways (here, at this site), If given the chance.<br>
If someone has a problem w/ what someone else has posted, it should go through the site admin.<br>
Or site officials, my view was that valar (and others) were wrong to criticize posts, but then I went and did the same thing. For a time I did go through WT though, but here lately I grew impatient and I am sorry for that.<br>
<br>
If I am to stay banned, then I am w/out regret for the things I had to say. <br>
It was me, real, raw, and undiluted. <br>
Please, after I am gone don't 'flame' the things I have said, take up weight lifting instead.<br>
If I am allowed to return, however, we can discuss things like adults - and perhaps come to a professional-like understanding.<br>
<br>
If given another chance, I will apologize and leave my bs out of these forums, and save it for the game.<br>
I am sorry for dirtying up your community, but don't forget, it is the world you live in. <br>
No, that’s not a gay-reference.<br>
No more effort will I put into this post, I don't even think I am going to be allowed to return. <br>
<br>
I am not a bad person...<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">New guy infects every server and forum he is allowed to join.  He has issues that go way beyond having a big mouth.  While I realize that I have little right to voice my opinion on this forum, I do help pay for the HL2DM University training server and we promote this website on our DM servers.  He has ruined these forums and hijacked every thread he has posted in.  I ask that you keep the ban in place. He spews his disgusting venom every time he opens his mouth.  Before he had a mic, he did it in chat. Speaking from experience, the only way to stop it is to ban him.   New Guy was banned from our servers when we were DOR. He harrassed Paradox (Piece of Work) so badly that she shut DOR down and went into hiding.  Later, we decided to start a new clan and start all over.  The minute he found out we were Khaos, it all started again.  I am too old and too cranky for all the bs.  Everyone who is friends with him is certainly entitled to disagree with me.  I will not get into a war of words.  I have said what I feel I needed to say and I am moving on.<br>
<br>
I will probably make Paradox and the admins of this forum angry at me for posting this, but those that think he is just being funny and that he is harmless need to see what is really going on.<br>
<br>
from Paradox to Grape Ape:<br>

New Guy PMed me this on the DMU forums<br>

Why do you think I am dangerous? Honestly? Cut the crap and answer me for a change, will ya? <br>
Do not BITCH at me, give me a sound response, or I will spam you for spreading lies about me.<br>
<br>
Thats why I started spamming you in the first place, a smart person would've figured that out.<br>
Lets keep this private now, okay?<br>

The link is to a video spoofing sexual harrassment.  So I am being given an ultimatum:  either talk to him or it will never stop, ever.  No one, with the exception of Impala and Valar has the guts to do or say anything about his BS.  Its been basically my word against his and there is no proof or backup that what I say is the truth.  I cant go to those forums now without his BS, I cant turn my steam friends on without his BS, there is no way around it.  Everyone wants to run away so I am joining the crowd and thats what I am doing too.<br>
So I guess I have to decide yet again whether the money, time and effort put into this game is worth the BS and now harrassment that I get out of it.  I get very little enjoyment lately and that doesnt seem like its going to change any time soon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

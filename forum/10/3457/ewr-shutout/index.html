AHem. Para, we have never had a disagreement. But apparently that was only because I haven't been reading the U forum. Just because you hate .Ewr doesn't mean you should disregard Frank. He has applied for EE. And he is dear friend of mine. Super Nice guy. And anyone that knows him will tell you the same. He is stating the complete truth. <br>
<br>
It is clear that many members of this community respect .Ewr and would love to wear the tags. You wouldn't an .Ewr tag? Well of course not. Because you don't have what it takes. It's not about skill. It's attitude. Your sense of humor must have gotten lost in the politics of it all. I guess I see now why Khaos fell apart. glhfdc.<br>
<br>
But this goes to everyone who has something bad to say about .Ewr. You can kiss our black asses. I would take a bullet for any in EE. We are family. So keep hating. We don't care.<br>
<br>
And in case you didn't know, the Evil Empire(including .Ewr) is here to stay and is better than ever before.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No and Im guessing many others wouldnt either. Personally, I would rather lose every match I played with players that were respected, then win every match with players that act like douchebags. I dont hate anyone from Ewr, they just dont have an attitude that I would want around me or my current teammates. Im sure para feels the same way.

Well, Frank's above posts doesnt show me that he is any different then the rest of them.

Not that I really care either way, but wouldnt he expect such a thing by joining probably the top rated clan in hl2dm and getting spanked that badly? Plus, I dont really think the screen was posted to belittle those two. Hell, their names arent even in the screenshot.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hyp, don't be such a girl and jump to conclusions.  No I don't hate Ewr, I dislike some of the things they do.  No I would not join ewr because I don't like the image they portray as a group. On an individual basis I have no problems with most of them.   I have never had an issue with EE either.  <br>
<br>
The fuck the community attitude that you yourself display in your post is the very reason this community is going to shit right now.  Its not CAL, or bugs in the game or whatever.  Good people have left because of it. That Guy left over the drama, Hax Cook, Defme, and others all left because of the bullshit drama.  Many others are now aliasing because they don't want to deal with it anymore.  That is where my sense of humor has gone Hyp, I have become cynical because I see no hope for this community or this game if it continues.<br>
<br>
 And BTW Khaos did not fall apart, I broke it apart on purpose for the good of everyone involved and both are doing quite well thanks.  Notice I wear two tags now?  One of them says Khaos.  Khaos is still very much alive and here  At least 4 other current Khaos have accounts here that they no longer use because they have better things to do with their time and just don't choose to paticipate in this community or these forums any more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Alas, to each his own. I understand that .Ewr mentality is not for everyone. That's fine. But if you talk down to one of my brothers, I am going to talk down to you.

Do I think it's right? Absolutely not, but when Ewr members talk shit to everyone and say how they are the greatest thing since sliced bread I expect players in other clans to jump on the opportunity to belittle them any chance they get. So yes, those 2 guys should be prepared for such things being in Ewr. Kinda comes with the territory I guess.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Huh? From what I see, he explained how he got into .ewR, then expressed his opinion that it bothers the people that asked to join .ewR and were turned away, then he gave a big "fuck you" to anyone who didn't like that he and Mike got in.<br>
<br>
So unless everyone asked to join .ewR and <em class="text-italics">everyone</em> doesn't like the fact that both of them got in, he didn't say fuck you to everyone. He made it pretty clear it was directed towards people who disliked it, which is only a few people. And really, it's understandable, a few people gave both Frank and .ewR shit because of them getting in, when its really none of their concern, so "fuck you" to them. <br>
<br>
You and Sacrifist made it clear that both of you don't care that he's in .ewR, so its obvious his comments  weren't directed towards you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes. I WILL be a girl. I have a vagina. So do you, remember? Unfortunately, you are the one jumping to conclusions.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you are cynical now. That's too bad. Because it should always be about fun. You see no hope? Seems to be doing okay...Don't try and carry the weight of drama in this game on your shoulders. The future of this game is to be seen regardless of what any one of us do. The people that left or alias take everything way too seriously which is what I see happening to you. You know how happy I am that you represent girl gaming on here. Like I said, I have never had a problem with you. Just don't talk bad about people you don't know without expecting repercussions. Especially from a clan like ours.<br>
My conclusions are you don't like me anyways. So we are level. <br>
<br>
By the way, I know I haven't earned my wings on this forum yet. But I had to jump in full force for justice to my peeps.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well Hyp your conclusion would be wrong.  Never had an issue with you and really I still dont.   We are having a conversation.  I chose to voice my opinion, you jumped in and responded.  I don't deny you that right.  Allow me the same curtesy.  I know full well what can happen when people post on these forums and I accept those consequences.<br>
<br>
Yes I have a vagina, and yes I am happy to see other girls playing.  I just don't choose to advertise.  I am also a female in a historically predominantly male occuption so it is territory I am used to.   I don't feel I deserve special recognition in anything I do because of my gender or that it should be a factor in how I am judged.<br>
<br>
When I see good people, people I enjoy playing with, getting turned off of something they love because of too much drama (not all is bad but there comes a breaking point), I feel it should be a wake up call.  The only way we are going to keep this going for as long as possible is if we work together.  That is if the goal is truly to keep this going, and growing if possible.  If its not then the wrong message is being portrayed.<br>

so im a bit confused again.  3 peeps?  2 peeps?  the same peep?  naw, gotta be at least 2... i think.  iirc, some khaos and synergy folks have devoted a bit of time helping with some advanced techniques to all 3...err 2?<br>
<br>
hell, crazybruts sported the khaos tag before the reorganization.  dunno what happened to him after that.  frank has improved quite nicely since tagging ewR.  good for him!<br>
<br>
but as far as the original pic in this thread... i took it with a grain of salt (not a nutri-grain either).  the way .ewR aliases, it could have been anybody on either team sharing an inside joke with herb.  just never know what you crazy young-uns are gonna pull next.  kyle was the one who mentioned the real identities, no one dissed frank or mike, voz complimented them for not rage quitting... then the lemmings arrived and attacked the straw men stalking mike and frank because they tagged .ewR<br>

	<div class="content">yeah you guys saved my water and I feel some shame from that<br>
but my kids got what they needed so it was very much worth the <br>
few attacks from some peeps here, those that helped my family are <br>
truly the hero's of this matter and we thank you from the bottom of <br>
our hearts.<br>
<br>
and no scamming from me, its just the 2 forums that i go to are an escape for me just <br>
as Para said, and think that i have many friends here so its healthy for me to come here.<br>
<br>
not to sponge off any one, i have never had to ask my friends let alone internet friends <br>
for any help with anything especially money,i have owned my own business for 20+ years<br>
so all the financial trouble caught me completely off guard,i mean the jobs just up and stopped altogether <br>
in a matter of 1 month (all that have kids(i have 3) know it's tough to get by sometimes even without the <br>
economy fucking up) and no more for 3 months other than minuscule little jobs that paid<br>
"one/part of a" bill. so its been very hard for us and millions of people country-wide.<br>
<br>
and i wont flame about the small attacks on here except to say i have ALWAYS been nice<br>
and respectful to the ENTIRE community even to the point of obsessively so, because<br>
i dont SHIT where i play simply so thanks alot there "nutri grain" i have definitely been respectful to<br>
you ALWAYS.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
All i did was point out the fact that you were still posting.  I didn't say you were trolling for money or any of that.  I just noticed that after you say you're being evicted and won't be around anymore, you're on the forum posting again in a few days.  I had no idea what was going on so I pointed it out.</div></blockquote>

Did you even read my post?  I was trying to apologize and make nice.  You have always been respectful to me Tazz.  Why would I say something to purposely hurt you in your deperate time of need?  I wouldn't.  I may be an ass online, but I'm not completely heartless.  I wish you and your family the best of luck Tazz.  Glad to see you aren't willing to vanish off the face of the internet just yet.  Keep fighting.</div></blockquote>

Yes... the quick and dirty rule of thumb is simply to remove the other person and see if the sentence makes sense.  Which ever makes sense is the one you should use.<br>
<br>
"This is suppose to be about me" &lt;- Right<br>
"This is suppose to be about I" &lt;- Wrong<br>
<br>
So "this is suppose to be about me and mike" or "this is suppose to be about mike and me" are both grammatically correct with the later being the "polite" way of saying it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

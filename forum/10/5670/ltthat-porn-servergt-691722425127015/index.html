Yeah - It is back, bitches; go <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?53x52vm5sa35kga" class="postlink"><strong class="text-strong">here</strong></a> to get the mod and play on it. <br>
<br>
Unless you are someone that likes playing people who don't know their ass from a random hole in a ground and/or are someone that has their head up their ass in regards to believing that less-dynamic-movement is somehow better. <br>
The nerfed movement has now taken the fish that are the players and crammed them in to the barrel that is now Stock hl2dm. <br>
If you find shooting fish in a barrel somehow amusing, chances are you are far to fucking ugly/pathetic to have an orgasm inside of anything alive/bipedal/sentient and therefore no chance of spreading your disgusting and ignorance-inclined genetic material. <br>
In sum: the problem that is "the people" who fall into one of the two aforementioned categories is well-contained.  <br>
<br>
Oh my, hl2dm, a game which has long been abandoned by its maker, and can only get worse as time moves on. <br>
In contrast, this mod has a dedicated coder and can only get better. <br>
Oh - and both are the same exact price, but what-da-fuck do I know? <br>
<br>
All the "issues" that I have been brought to my attention by people of a more elitist attitude (the people that I *want* to populate my server) are only <em class="text-italics">really</em> found on the Molesterland Linux-hacked server. <br>
That server is taking a source 2009 engine and then hacking it to emulate source 2007. It was a stop-gap solution by Mewash aka Molester<br>
<br>
Nades being "heavier," hitboxes being "out of sync," and et cetera, are all non-existent and have yet to be seen on my properly hosted windows server. <br>
However, James will need to fix his linux issues, for no game can really go worldwide without linux support: 
<blockquote><div><cite>Valar wrote:</cite>I will not touch this software if it does not have proper linux support</div></blockquote> <br>
Which is a valid point, not many other proper gamers will, but one step is to be taken at one time. <br>
<br>
All the people who matter will get rcon from me so you can play real scrims on the real game on my real server. <br>
Go and see for yourself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Round time : 25 min <br>
Thanks to Edge I have the eFPS-like cfg's with proper server-side wait command stuff. <br>
Once again, thank you kind sir. <br>
Also, many more maps are on the server to scrim on, such as shitty amplitude and of the like. I wont Judge, except yes I fucking will. <br>
Record a demo when you play, so I have something tangible to goto James with in the event that a glitch/error actually occurs. <br>
I don't want shifty cunt-stains complaining about hit-reg, when - it fact - it is their hacks that have a hard time working on the mod. <br>
Thank you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I case any other windows server renters want to switch over, send this to your gameserver provider: 
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Installing the OB mod:<br>
<br>
Step 1: Install a clean SRCDS with orangebox and hl2mp using the following commands:<br>
<br>
steam -command update -game hl2mp -dir<br>
<br>
steam -command update -game orangebox -dir<br>
<br>
Step 2: Download and unzip <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?53x52vm5sa35kga" class="postlink">http://www.mediafire.com/?53x52vm5sa35kga</a><br>
Into the orangebox directory. The orangebox directory should now contain both the hl2mp folder and the newly extracted hl2mpob folder. <br>
<br>
Step 3: Edit the file “YOUR.SERVER.IP_PORT/orangebox/hl2mpob/cfg/server.cfg” <br>
by adding the line "sv_password abc123" in order to introduce a password, so that the server does not violate the private server criterion. <br>
It does not matter if the server is paid for as public; this criterion exists within the code of the mod. <br>
Any public server can have the password removed entirely after the initial boot-up.<br>
<br>
Step 4: Modify the srcds_run command line so that where it once said<br>
"-game hl2mp" so it now says "-game hl2mpob". <br>
<br>
Step 5 (conditional): Linux servers will need legacy .dll files in the bin folder: to download = <a href="http://www.mygamecp.com/Uploads/Support/TC3807046687002/TC3064708263246/orangebox.rar" class="postlink">http://www.mygamecp.com/Uploads/Support ... ngebox.rar</a> <br>
Windows servers "shouldn't" need them, and I don't think mine did. <br>
<br>
Step 6: Start server through web interface. 
</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">EDIT</strong>: Strangely enough, my server does not have a orangebox folder, must be a linux-only thing. <br>
See attached. <br>
I'll ask my support guy what he did to get it working so well.</div>

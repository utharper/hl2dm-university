	<div class="content">Tell me your favorite music. That one(s) that made you feel good, or travel along when you hear it, or that old song that still fill's your heart with something good.<br>
<br>
Any music style will do.<br>
<br>
Here's mine:<br>
<a href="https://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=CCN2axDPsMc&amp;feature=related" class="postlink">Simon and Garfunkel -Mrs. Robinson</a><br>
<br>
An old song but I still love it as if it was new. A little out of my usual stuff, as I'm alot into heavy stuff. But I listen to whatever is well done and especially what's made with heart.<br>
<br>

Fleetwood Mac - Rumours (lost my virginity to this album)  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
before we were of age to go to bars, there were a number of "dance" clubs back in the days of disco.  to find girls, you had to go to the dance clubs.  almost any given disco song will trigger a memory of a particular girl i became smitten with.  kc and the sunshine band, donna summer, pointer sisters, bee gees (gag), gloria gaynor, etc.<br>
<br>
we used to sit around at a particular "party house".  a friend whose mother divorced when she realized she was a lesbian and had absolutely no rules about how we behaved in her house.  she would buy us beer/liquor if we couldn't get it on our own and really could care less if anyone smoked dope.  this continued throughout high school and into my driving years.  we listened to boston, reo speedwagon, peter frampton, head east, supertramp, kiss, ac/dc, van halen, april wine, ted nugent, nazareth, aldo nova, steve miller band, grand funk railroad, kansas, toto, queen, lynyrd skynryd, cheap trick, foghat, bob seger, foreigner, led zeppelin, zz top... man i could go on and on.  anything from those groups takes me back to those wild times... causing me to shake my head and wonder in amazement how i survived all the drunk driving we used to do in those days.<br>

aaah, the good ol' times... Those groups bring me a whole load of memories too. From discos (from the time there were discos here with rock music. Now it's all tecno-like. bah.) to bars and girls and friends and crazy things we did when we're young and mindless and careless... I miss that. I surely loved to drive with a few(?) joints in my head.<br>

Friend Bear (Ted Nugent) was one of my songs from those times. But there's one that brings me much more memories. Even older memories:<br>

is that a parody or is Justin Timberlake really like that???<br>
<br>
From my home town Cascais (lisbon, portugal) comes this band called Primitive Reason. One of the best portuguese bans ever. They play a music style that is (I guess) somewhat a derivate from reggae. It's Ska music. Mixtures of reggae chords with heavy vocals and distorted power chords in some of their songs, always played much faster than reggae, makes their style. (That is, if it really is Ska. lol I was never sure.)<br>
<br>
This is a live version of the most know song. I like them live cuz they have energy and they are contagious. I loved all the times I saw them live. <br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ9AS75sqsg" class="postlink">Primitive Reason - Seven Fingered Friend - Live</a><br>
<br>
but since there's no good live version of this song in youtube, I included the original video clip (that is a little stupid in some things... lol they were kids at the time) so you can listen to the song as it really is.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgV003YwIsI" class="postlink">Primitive Reason - Seven Fingered Friend (official clip)</a><br>
<br>
Then they grew up, traveled a lot and came up with a new album. Heavyer on the guitar and vocals and more elaborate in the overall. I couldn't find my favorite from that album.<br>
It doesn't say in the description or in the title but I know this one was recorded when they performed live in Cascais, in a bar called Lotus Bar (Now called Rock n' Shots). I am there... somewhere... in the middle of everyone.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"><br>

but unfortunately the rap/hip hop culture has been completely manipulated by the media and is clearly exploiting an entire race for profit, and be real, where  are you going to hear rap/hip hop... 99% of the time in the media... and the media is clearly obscuring it to there liking since it did originate in "the hood" and its biggest demographic is "the hood" and kids these days like bitches and hoes and guns and wat not.... but... also like.. im a total metal head, unfortunately due to the media there known ass a bunch of serial killers that like to rape dead girls ( which is a giant joke ) but as for musical technicality and skill, rap / hip hop has close to none imo , its all computer generated.. you could literally get a monkey to make beats that would impress the kids these days...<br>

I love acoustic version of these songs. I did that once with a friend of mine that has a bigger [insert name of that drum-like instrument here] and we played some really fast Black Metal/Grindcore just like these two guys.<br>
I love that. I'm thinking of getting my friend to study some songs and maybe we'll be "back on the business".<br>

<br>
My response:  You are blind to what you see and hear on the radio then, it is after all the radio and the television producers who decide which music they want to play to the general public, and therefore shape the public's view of what good (rap) music is.  You use snoop dogg as an example.  Let me get this straight.  Snoop, Lil wayne, Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent, Lil jon, etc. etc. are <strong class="text-strong">SELLOUTS</strong>.  I'm sure you are familiar with the term?  They have sold out to what BIG TIME COMPANIES A.K.A THE MEDIA....HAVE TOLD THEM TO PRODUCE, IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY.  The problem goes deeper than the artists themselves, and if you can't see that then you are truly blind.  Do you think artists are able to decide whether their music is played on the radio and tv....hell no....the media controls the media, not the artists.  The bullshit you hear on the radio IS NOT HIP HOP....which brings me to my next point.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your Statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>dirk wrote:</cite>you are proclaiming people's ignorance because they do not share your choice of music, and honestly, I find that to be just plain ignorant.</div></blockquote>

My original statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>G wrote:</cite>ignorance towards the culture of hip hop.  not one of you know the history.</div></blockquote>

My response: Read carefully, I did not proclaim anyone's ignorance towards any choice of music, nor did I object to you disagreeing with mine which was clear when I said, "anyway im not here to argue, you don't see me dissing any of your artists." However since you clearly are here to argue I guess I now am too.  First of all, HIP HOP is NOT a musical genre.  It is a culture.  Rap music is 1 of the 4 elements of hip hop.  The other 3 include dj'ing or scratching, graffiti art, and b-boying or breakin', commonly referred to be the media as breakdancing.  Rap is simply a part of hip hop, but hip hop is not solely rap.  It was only after the big man with the money exploited the musical aspect of hip hop for his own gain that rap music began to separate from the rest of the elements(rest assured they were all went hand in hand at one time)  For a quick history lesson, hip hop started in the south bronx in 1972, and can arguably be narrowed down to 5120 Sedgwick Avenue.  A man known as DJ Kool Herc began to mix records together(now known as dj'ing) and throw parties.  What he noticed is that when the people danced, they began to get down to the break of the record(or break in the song where all the beat drops out except for the drum, usually on the 4 count)  Hence the term b-boy or break-boy or BREAKdancing.  Break was a slang term at the time.  This was quickly accompanied by rap music and graffiti art.  Afrika Bambaataa then evolved this into the true culture of hip hop, founded on the ideals of peace, love, unity, and having fun.<br>
<br>
The end.    So we continue....<br>
<br>

The problem goes deeper than the artists themselves, and if you can't see that then you are truly blind.

The bullshit you hear on the radio IS NOT HIP HOP....which brings me to my next point.</div></blockquote>

And also, producers are one of the tools for the records companies. They shape musicians into what they've been told that sells. The artists are no more, they are money machines. They get rich making record companies's profit and producers keep they jobs.<br>
<br>
I'm too sleepy to tell all I know in inglish.... lol, but there's a whole lotta reasons for me to search more and more for underground music, as the mainstream (that what radios broadcast) is mostly crap that they say is AWSOME, and ppl believe, either for not being musicaly instructed (or missintructed), or for not knowing much more music, and are resigned to stay that way.<br>
<br>
Music = Art, but unfortunately, aswell as most other forms of art, for some it means $ or € or £ or whatever.<br>
<br>

I still fail to see how I disrespected a race with that statement.<br>
<br>
Statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>dirk wrote:</cite>I did not say hip hop or rap or R&amp;B sucks.</div></blockquote>

Previous Statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>dirk wrote:</cite>And their music even has chord progressions!</div></blockquote>

I did not realize any of the words in my statement translated to rap, hip hop, etc. sucks. Interesting interpretation you've got there. I suppose I realize how you have come to that conclusion, but mind you, I never said <em class="text-italics">not</em> having chord progressions was wrong, dumb, bad etc.<br>
<br>
Statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>dirk wrote:</cite>and I did it jokingly <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">.</div></blockquote>

Previous statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>dirk wrote:</cite>But I guess I shouldn't take the piss</div></blockquote>

Maybe someone from across the pond will correct me, and if so I apologize ahead of time, but the expression means to kid, have fun with, <em class="text-italics">joke</em>.<br>
<br>
Your statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>dirk wrote:</cite>The media has not warped anyone's perception of their music, that is a total bullshit cop-out statement, they <em class="text-italics">VERY</em> clearly state how they wish to be perceived with their lyrics, photo-ops, and blinged out videos.</div></blockquote> <br>
<br>
My response:  You are blind to what you see and hear on the radio then, it is after all the radio and the television producers who decide which music they want to play to the general public, and therefore shape the public's view of what good (rap) music is.  You use snoop dogg as an example.  Let me get this straight.  Snoop, Lil wayne, Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent, Lil jon, etc. etc. are <strong class="text-strong">SELLOUTS</strong>.  I'm sure you are familiar with the term?  They have sold out to what BIG TIME COMPANIES A.K.A THE MEDIA....HAVE TOLD THEM TO PRODUCE, IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY.  The problem goes deeper than the artists themselves, and if you can't see that then you are truly blind.  Do you think artists are able to decide whether their music is played on the radio and tv....hell no....the media controls the media, not the artists.  The bullshit you hear on the radio IS NOT HIP HOP....which brings me to my next point.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">You</strong> deeming something a sellout is a matter of opinion, not fact. I actually abhor the term, who are you or I to say what someone creates is selling out. How do you know that the artists you listed are not passionate about what they say, no matter how ridiculous others may find it? You do not know these individuals; do not claim to know what goes on their heads. I still stand by my statement, while I do agree the media can twist things in their favor, it is still the supposed sellouts responsibility, after all they are the ones who wrote/sang/rhymed whatever they are trying to get across, be it for money, fame, etc. So to blame the media is as I said before, a total cop-out. If we do not hold the artists themselves accountable, how will things ever change?<br>
 <br>
My original statement:
<blockquote><div><cite>G wrote:</cite>ignorance towards the culture of hip hop.  not one of you know the history.</div></blockquote>

My response: Read carefully, I did not proclaim anyone's ignorance towards any choice of music, nor did I object to you disagreeing with mine which was clear when I said, "anyway im not here to argue, you don't see me dissing any of your artists." However since you clearly are here to argue I guess I now am too.  First of all, HIP HOP is NOT a musical genre.  It is a culture.  Rap music is 1 of the 4 elements of hip hop.  The other 3 include dj'ing or scratching, graffiti art, and b-boying or breakin', commonly referred to be the media as breakdancing.  Rap is simply a part of hip hop, but hip hop is not solely rap.  It was only after the big man with the money exploited the musical aspect of hip hop for his own gain that rap music began to separate from the rest of the elements(rest assured they were all went hand in hand at one time)  For a quick history lesson, hip hop started in the south bronx in 1972, and can arguably be narrowed down to 5120 Sedgwick Avenue.  A man known as DJ Kool Herc began to mix records together(now known as dj'ing) and throw parties.  What he noticed is that when the people danced, they began to get down to the break of the record(or break in the song where all the beat drops out except for the drum, usually on the 4 count)  Hence the term b-boy or break-boy or BREAKdancing.  Break was a slang term at the time.  This was quickly accompanied by rap music and graffiti art.  Afrika Bambaataa then evolved this into the true culture of hip hop, founded on the ideals of peace, love, unity, and having fun.<br>
<br>
So, again you claim to know what people are thinking. You are certain that not one of us knows the history. I never questioned the validity, history, or integrity of your beloved culture to begin with. Also, as you quoted yourself as saying, which means you've said it twice now, you did indeed say that we are showing "ignorance towards the culture of hip hop". <em class="text-italics">You</em> said that, not I. And I'm the supposed blind one. By saying that I showed ignorance is indeed saying that I am being ignorant of something, which in turn deems me ignorant supposedly. <br>
<br>
<br>
The end.    So we continue....<br>
<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>dirk wrote:</cite>And we are both sitting here wondering what this agenda you speak of is?</div></blockquote></div></blockquote> <br>
Maybe "agenda" isn't the right word, basically you just disrespecting my musical tastes and substituting your own, much like hardcore christians do when they try to force conversion.  I didn't take it personally though.<br>
<br>
Apparently you did take it personally, as I once again fail to see how I disrespected your musical tastes. I did nothing more than point out that you listed no white musicians, which as I explained above, I was joking about to begin with. Where did I say "stop listening to that crap and tune in to MY music because it is better"? (side note: for a person so big on not being disrespectful, grats on disrespecting "hardcore christians" ) <br>
<br>
I will admit that maybe I chose the wrong term by saying crying out, but you said that it was meant to unify a culture. Well, to unify is to organize, group together, stand as one against something, which is accomplished in this case by speaking, singing, rhyming, writing music which are all forms of crying out to one another to do so. <br>
<br>
So to sum up, I'm sorry if my original post offended you, it was not my intention. All I really see here is you reaching for a reason to defend an entire culture which can speak for itself, it does not need you to do it, nor do I need a "history lesson" on the hip hop culture. Music is music, it's sounds that are interpreted differently by everyone, which is why it is cool to begin with, it is unique to everyone. You took offense to a joke that maybe was made in bad taste, I am a big boy and will admit that, but you repeatedly put words in my mouth which I simply never said, and wrongly interpreted statements that we're never meant the way you seem to have understood them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I love  Korn, one of the few ''numetal'' bands i like.They have been changing styles tho, and they arent numetal for long time now actually. Probably thats why they are still alive not like most of nu-metal bands who showed up with ''nu-metal boom'' and then disappeared after a year. Cant wait when they will start to work on their new CD. I hope it will be kinda <em class="text-italics">deathmetal'ish</em><br>
<br>

	<div class="content">I stopped considering them nu metal at their Follow the Leader album. It's probably my favorite album, but I don't see much of their roots there. But, it may still be considered like that, otherwise I can't find a way to describe they music.<br>
Most of the "nu metal" bands from now are all the same and very unimpressive.<br>
<br>
Since X-Mas is here, take this X-Mas song by Korn. <br>

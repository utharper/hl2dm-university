Lmao, ok. So HL2:CTF should be limited to what is in HL2 now? We also have the OICW that was removed from HL2, should we remove that too? There isnt walljumping, bhopping, explosion jumping, runes, or flags in HL2 either. Should we remove them as well? This weapon is specifically for instagib mode. It might be available for regular play, but its going to be a 1 hit kill weapon and will be very powerful. Any mapper with common sense would be hard pressed to add it to their map with the idea of it keeping the map balanced. The guy that made the model did a very good job of making it look like something that could be a rebel weapon as it was a requirement we put on him.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No, it is a CTF and you should have flags and stuff, thats why it is named HL2CTF instead of HL2DM. You have sniper rifles, you have the AR1, you have the Alyx's gun. And that's ok, they are actually HL2 weapons. You want to add Quake weapons? CS weapons? Ok, name it Quake CTF or CS CTF, not HL2CTF.<br>

Nope, I dont see your point. I understand what you are trying to say, but at the same time, it should be named HL2:CTF as long as the stock maps stay within the realm of HL2 (for the most part) and the models are rebels and combine. Anything else is fair game imo.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

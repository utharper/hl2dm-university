	<div class="content">Oh man ... where to begin.<br>
<br>
The entire prophecy was originally given in Daniel.<br>
<br>
The entire length of time is 2300 days but more specifically the little horn of power is given rule for 1260 days. ( during the last portion of the 2300 days )<br>
<br>
the 42 months is 1260 days correct?  ( remember jewish calendar is 30 months to a day ).<br>
<br>
In the Bible, a day in prophecy is a year to us:  Numbers 14:34 "After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, <em class="text-italics"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">each day for a year</strong></span></em>, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise."<br>
<br>
After these 1260 years, Revelation says that Jesus will begin cleansing the Heavenly Sanctuary ( same as happened on earth on Yom Kippur ).  During this time the Anti-Christ will rise on earth.  The prophecy also states that he will deceive many.  This man is not a Muslim, but will be brought forth from within the Christian community.  Once you see our government (USA) start to enforce certain religious beliefs, and other governments following, then you will know the time is near.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm not going to get into any religious debates ... I was just trying to explain what the 42 months was.  And that Revelation states nowhere that it is a Muslim.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I seen it in the comments when I viewed that obama/McCain dance off thing posted earlier.  I just searched the comments in the hope of posting the exact link to that comments page but I gave up.  It appears a million friggin people commenting on that thing overnight.  <br>
<br>
Wasnt trying to start anything, I just thought they were funny comments.  Although I see a lot of racisim being pointed at people now if they disagree about something with our new president.  The Internet is stupid.  I should make a "In Response to the Net" post to...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's NOT the fault of congress -_-<br>
<br>
The FCC (under the supervision of the president) blocked comcast's attempts to arbitrarily charge more money for things like watching/downloading videos or the ability to “block or slow specific sites”. The D.C. Appeals court which has a conservative majority and is known for siding with big business is to blame. Sorry to make this sh*t partisan but it is in reality. It is indeed one major blow to the era of our internet freedom IMO...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The FCC can go to hell.<br>
Good job stopping the Gubbmint from further control over the private sector.<br>

My question is what is this "Save the Internet" bullshit!!??!<br>
Is there a problem with FIOS?<br>
Are folks being discriminated or unable to use the internet?<br>
<br>
Net Neutrality is just another Gubbmint power grab.<br>
Private companies that invest billions can administer their networks as they see fit.<br>
Broadband is not a right.<br>
<br>
I have a real beef! Business does NOTHING arbitrarily!<br>
Insurance companies do not operate arbitrarily and Internet Providers do not operate arbitrarily.<br>
Much of their bandwidth is reserved for real business concern, you know, so business can thrive and folks can have a job!!??!?<br>
Hellloooooooo.<br>
<br>
The DC Court ruled like it did because the case had no standing whatsoever.<br>
Even the Neutrality argument is NOT that downloaders are charged more.<br>
The providers charge users, like business networks MORE and make more.<br>
<br>
Frankly, to treat Torrent downloaders on the same footing as a business network is frickin nuts.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

oh okay, so the "evil leftists" are all about paying a company in order to have bandwith, in fact, they're doing it right now. You pay for the  bandwith usage and they set the prices, if you exceed your limit, you pay for it. If it "hogs" their bandwith, isn't this company's fault if they can't provide a decent service or live up to what they claim to be able to offer? <br>
<br>
See it as a service, if a restaurant claims " Food served under 5min! " the restaurant gets so popular that it can't live to it's promises, they either hire, grow and fix it, or people complain, leave and the place eventually closes or become miserable.<br>
<br>
What people are complaining about is that now, this restaurant is telling you " I fucked up due to bad management, but i'm gonna use the law to help me out! "<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
People pay for food under 5 min, like we pay for a given amount of bandwidth. When you pay you expect your food under 5 min, and you expect to be able on your pron if you payed for it.<br>
<br>
You can't do business, you don't. The business you're in is bottlenecked by technology or by overpopularity? Deal with it or close. Pure hard rightist business. Exactly what's missing in this case.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
The company whines people upload too much therefore there should be regulations?<br>
<br>
What the fuck, make me pay for it instead? People upload/Download too much? raise the prices. Gtfo with your laws and regulations off the internet is what i'm saying.<br>
Comcasts and verizon are the leftists here in my eyes, begging for help while they get their bandwidth raped away by customers while they're being unable to respond to the growing demand.<br>
<br>
What's happening is this:  Comcast lets you upload only (example) 10 mb / day for 10$/month.  But what if I do 50 mb / day? well, simple enough, they'll charge me extra. But get this, if you keep going, and you pay, and pay, no matter the extra, these companies WILL lock your account and tell you you keep breaking the limits.<br>
<br>
What the fuck. I give you MY money for YOU to develop your business and expand and take over the world, and you don't let me because of bs limitations? <br>
The problem is, it stops the evolution of technology, it stops the content quality (streaming HD video wouldve been never possible with the better bandwitdh internet plans we have today etc..) it's overall fucking stupid. <br>
<br>
A business usually struggles to pinpoint his customer's demand in order to grow and take over. Now people are pointing at the problem, check in their hand, saying<br>
"I will and want to  pay more for more " but they won't give it. Instead they're gonna cap internet usage instead of trying to figure out a way to serve their client base.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's like saying " cars are a source of pollution and pollution is a problem, therefore, we will limit you of using your car twice a day" instead of figuring out how to make cars that ARENT a source of pollution. People will and want to pay for internet, they always did, they're used to it. They just want to see the fucking companies DELIVER.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
First off, they aren't MY laws. And the court made a simple ruling that the FCC has no STANDING to determine how providers can use THEIR networks.<br>
As much as i would like to live in a liberal world where there is unlimited bandwidth, free stuff, and Unicorns, i do not.<br>

<br>
Comcast, no matter how evil, has a business plan and operating costs and needs to minimize variables.<br>
If you use consistently more bandwidth than you sign up for, there needs to be a new contract with them.<br>
How do folks use way more bandwidth than they pay for?!?<br>
Isn't it capped?<br>
I don't see any specific instances where accounts were closed.<br>
I see a lot of anecdotal stuff.<br>

Try again, Obama appointed an FCC chairman that believes websites are all equal, all have the ability to be viewed and none have the right to be blocked, slowed or have tolls put on them (unless there is premium content a website owner requires to be payed for) to view.

I pay for a service so I may view whatever I please on the internet.

Why can't you picture the long term? Do you know how the Chinese government blocks websites? It pays ISP providers in China (including Google) through bribes, threats, and government funding to block whatever sites they deem "dangerous". Nothing is blocked yet, no website is slowed yet, no website has a toll put on it yet, but that's because the ruling was just handed down today. Give it years and you will see the rise of for profit viewing restrictions handed down by your ISP.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

oh okay, so the "evil leftists" are all about paying a company in order to have bandwith, in fact, they're doing it right now. You pay for the  bandwith usage and they set the prices, if you exceed your limit, you pay for it. If it "hogs" their bandwith, isn't this company's fault if they can't provide a decent service or live up to what they claim to be able to offer? <br>
<br>
See it as a service, if a restaurant claims " Food served under 5min! " the restaurant gets so popular that it can't live to it's promises, they either hire, grow and fix it, or people complain, leave and the place eventually closes or become miserable.<br>
<br>
What people are complaining about is that now, this restaurant is telling you " I fucked up due to bad management, but i'm gonna use the law to help me out! "<br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
People pay for food under 5 min, like we pay for a given amount of bandwidth. When you pay you expect your food under 5 min, and you expect to be able on your pron if you payed for it.<br>
<br>
You can't do business, you don't. The business you're in is bottlenecked by technology or by overpopularity? Deal with it or close. Pure hard rightist business. Exactly what's missing in this case.</div></blockquote>

Most people seem to be in favor of moving toward upgrading the system.<br>

I would like to get faster service but right now Fios wont install in my area because of some 5 year non-competitive agreement they have with the local cable company.  So if some kind of upgrade happens, it will be a good thing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Okay, so setting a standard for making bigger ISPs such as comcast upgrade their equipment and make two different segments for the networking between business and home users is to much to ask?<br>
<br>
And a limited bandwidth? Bandwidth could practically be unlimited with newer technologies.<br>
<br>
Currently you're paying for a certain amount of bandwidth to be used at any given time. If speeds are cut back due to your ISP saying "Nope fuck you we don't like what you're using" you're not going to have a problem with that? You're paying for access at a certain speed, but nope they're saying "Oh, smtp, fuck that, we're going to make you send out email at 1 byte per second." This is what power they will have if the ruling stays the same.<br>
<br>
While I'm at it, most businesses SHOULD go with something like T1 or T3 or even better connections that are dedicated unshared connections. Then it wouldn't even be a problem to deal with bandwidth, because it would put it on businesses to use proper connections for their sites (buildings).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Working every year to improve their services? no proof whatsoever? take a good look at your ISP's plan, look at how fast technology grows and look at how slow they're upgrading on purpose.<br>
Why on EARTH would they give you 800 mb/s if they can gradually make you pay for years from 20mbs to 800. <br>
<br>
Look at Apple's iPad, if you open it there's a socket for a webcam there, connectors and everything, i'm pretty damn sure the next version is gonna get one. Why didn't the first one get a camera? fucking iphone has it and it's THAT much smaller. That's how this kind of business works, fooling the ignorants.<br>
<br>
Like oversea calls, please, everything is VOIP now, knowing this, why is talking on the mic in game, msn, skype etc... free " well you paid for these things and for your internet"<br>
fair enough, but chances are, your phone provider is ALSO your ISP (it's fairly common) and ooooh see what they did there?  As of today, there is NO reason whatsoever anyone should pay additional fee for oversea call. the only reason these fees are still there is because people are clueless and are used to pay.<br>

lol yeah im done with this thread and arguing with you. You claim company monolopies are fictitious, that they dont try to limit their market and they dont contract the highest power lawyers in the world to write complicated contracts to keep smaller newer companies at bay, I think you're living in a dream world. I think its pretty sad really you really believe what just wrote above.<br>
<br>
As Edge explained to me this case is actually about RIAA wanting to control bit torrent channels so peer to peer users will no longer be able to download music for free, its not about lack of bandwidth, in fact we have almost an infinite amount. It's about big business and big music wanting to control its profits nothing more. Unfortunately the side effect of this ruling is it does create more opportunites for ISP's to charge for viewing certain things, and the right to slow or block whatever websites they feel.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This issue is not about the RIAA. There is no way to control P2p file sharing. It is protected under the Digital Millenium Act. I issue is Net Neutrality and treating all traffic equal, which the court found the FCC has no standing to regulate, just like the FCC has no standing telling radio companies what talk shows they can air, or forcing a Fairness Doctrine.<br>
<br>
The problem is NOT a problem. Nothing is being blocked and the P2P traffic has not been capped.<br>
If that happens, there is recourse under the law separately.<br>
File Sharing is a freedom that isn't going away.<br>

Wrong, for a period of time, comcast blocked all traffic to 4chan.org. Also slowing slowing down Bittorrent traffic isn't a good thing either, nor peer-to-peer traffic.

"You want P2P to be fast as well? Yea, 10 Dollars Extra A Month. or the 10DEAM plan" DEAAAAMMMMMM, well its missing an N but you get the point. =p Even if its speculation that they'll do something like this you can make an educated guess just by looking at history.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You miss the whole point of my argument and the ruling.<br>
<br>
The FCC did not prove there was a problem, nor that they had standing in regulating in a sector that WAS, hands off.<br>
The FCC literally does not have the power to butt in on Providers business plan and networks.<br>
This is a good thing, because DESPITE the horrible problems on the internet (4Chan? Downloading frr stuff) completely exaggerated, we are a nation of LAW and the FCC are unelected doofuses unable to run a company like Comcast at a profit, in a largely unregulated sector, where the FCC has no Priori powers.<br>
<br>
That is why we have elected officials, that represent the PEOPLE!<br>
If they want to treat 4 Chan like ADT or CITI, or whatever, SOBEIT.<br>
<br>
The whole argument boils down, not to the nonsense anecdotes and horror stories, but POWER.<br>
And what you are asking is NOT DEMOCRATIC, but more unbridled gubbmint power.<br>
<br>
As i said, you should be careful what you ask for.<br>
GO SLOW!<br>
Think this out.<br>
Understand that business operates by plan and not arbitrarily.<br>
<br>
Whatever points i have conceded have been returned.<br>
I sided with the law and so will the Supreme Court.<br>
It's like Scalia says, pass a law!<br>
<br>
EDIT: Well it seems, i the Wiki Blas posted, it was NOT censorship, but the realities of an imperfect world.<br>
One thing i do notice is the tendency for Liberal knee jerk reaction ie "They are banning 4Chan! Ultraman engage!<br>
<br>
It's nonsense.<br>
  "  —  In the end, this wasn't a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&amp;T's part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably didn't anticipate [nor intend] the consequences of doing so. We're glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.[96]"<br>

gd u make me wanna vomit vals.  are u just a fucking partisan hack or completely ignorant?<br>
<br>
obama and his appointee to the FCC, Julius Genachowski, have nothing to do with this ruling.  NOTHING!!!  r u trying to rewrite time?  history?  <br>
<br>
back in august of 2008, the FCC handed comcast a cease-and-desist order and required the company to disclose to subscribers in the future how it plans to manage traffic.  the FCC chairman was Kevin Martin, a Republican.  and yes, Martin sided with 2 Democratic commissioners giving the measure a 3-2 approval.  OMFG!!!!!  and the four original principles of net neutrality were adopted in 2005 by another Republican FCC Chairman, Michael Powell.  HSOMFGNW!!!!<br>
<br>
and those evil conservative judges removing the FCC's jurisdiction over internet restrictions?  bullshit.  back in 1986 the Supreme Court has ruled that the FCC has no power to regulate "unless and until Congress confers power upon it".  <br>
<br>
this whole net neutrality thing just baffles me.  how do we propose to the keep the internet open?  regulate it!  ffs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Your retort was pretty stupid. You ask what the FCC and Julius Genachowski have to do with this. Do you know who Comcast sued and named one of the lead defendants? The FCC and Julius Genachowski, this case had everything to do with the FCC. Also your supreme court case was incorrect, it ruled on matters not specific to direct internet censorship or blocking, otherwise the case wouldnt even have been heard in appelate court nor an appeals court if the Supreme Court had ruled on it.<br>
<br>
One more thing, you know Michael Powell is a moderate right? He gets heat and some label him a RINO, he centers on alot of issues, but I give him credit for supporting net neutrality and that he is indeed a republican. But there are differences between a republican and a conservative, you can be a republican but not have a outright conservative philosophy, just ask George W. Bush.<br>
<br>
It is true that two of the three deciding judges in this case are known for strong conservative views. Also if you and impala love this ruling so much and support it, go sign up for comcast and have fun with slow loading webpages and fees to use P2P clients, I'll stick with a company who believes in net nuetrality. One more thing the internet is not going to die, Comcast and AT+T have almost unlimited bandwidth, all they need is systems to maximize the potential of their bandwidth capabilities, but theyre too lazy or dont want to spend the money to do like France and Japan have done.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok so once again I guess you really believe there is no relationship between RIAA and Comcast, here's one more article for you then. <a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.cfm/2005/04/16/comcast_sued_for_giving_subscriber_info_to_riaa" class="postlink">http://www.afterdawn.com/news/article.c ... fo_to_riaa</a><br>
It must be you that lives in a fairy tale world that Comcast works with RIAA free of services, unless you think Comcast is working with RIAA just for the heck of it.  In all likelyhood is what Edge hinted of P2P fees... Comcast and AT+T will work with RIAA to not completely block P2P's but to put user fee's for anyone who uses these clients, and share the profits of these fees with the recording industry. That's my guess, we shall see as time goes on like I said.<br>

I believe in the concept that I pay my ISP to give me internet access to look at and download whatever I damn well please short of CP. I dont want to live in the next China where China flexes its government muscles through ISP's to fund the blocking of whatever they want, but invariably we seem to inch closer towards a crumbling of democracy, perhaps its just inevitable. For me its a moral and idealogical call to keep internet from being censured in ANY way, no one IMO has the right to block any website to me (unless of course we're talking about looking at CP <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">)</div></blockquote>

<br>
Yeah but unlike China another co. will pop up that can blast Comcast for doing this and then get customers from it for telling it straight.  Any of the ISP's that do not sell movies or internet phone services would be able to blast Comcast for this practice.  This would be why they can really only slow and limit, not outright block anything.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The FCC's enabling statute (the law that gives the FCC its authority as an agency) authorized the agency to regulate all wired communications. Obviously, when the enabling statute was passed, cable television didn't exist. When cable came out, cable companies argued in court that the FCC had no authority to regulate cable. The cable companies lost - because cables are wires. The same battle is unfolding today about the internet. The FCC has been ruled to have authority to regulate the internet. The only problem in the FCC ruling that BuckyKatt posted was the fact that that ruling was made against a Title I (unregulated) service. The FCC has full authority to immediately reclassify cable broadband under Title II (regulated) services. <br>
<br>
In other words, don't freak out. The FCC is still committed to net neutrality. This isn't a roadblock, its just a puddle.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here is another problem with Valiums argument: He stated that ISPs NOW have the power to block traffic and sites...as if this ruling unleashed a black plague. Such a statement is informative because, part of his argument is that there is a major problem blocking service and traffic as a MATTER OF POLICY.<br>
<br>
The ISPs always HAD the capability to block anything. They STILL have the capability shut down ALL traffic on their networks.<br>
In fact, they have the capability to go out of business and shut out millions of internet users.<br>
<br>
So, they have had and STILL have that capability.<br>
The fact is, they have not used these capabilities.<br>
They have not engaged in picking sites they don't like.<br>
And as another poster said, they have slowed down file sharing traffic because of excessive bandwidth use, meaning there IS a limit to bandwidth.<br>
There always was a limit.<br>
There always will be a limit.<br>
<br>
So, the activity Valiums accuses is not a rule, a nefarious plot, a trust of RIAA and Comcast, a business plan of the ISPs.<br>
The argument is based on exaggeration and nonsense.<br>
The Left is relentless in their insane egalitarian nonsense. Everything is PLOT, a CONSPIRACY to stop illegal activity (!?!?!? law enforcement conspiracy!?!?!), a takeover by evil faceless corporations.<br>
<br>
The Whole time, these freedom loving lefties want unelected bureaucrats to regulate the Internet further.<br>
THAT IS FUCKING CRAZY!<br>
<br>
Here is a statement from Valiums:<br>
"I believe in the concept that I pay my ISP to give me internet access to look at and download whatever I damn well please short of CP."<br>
<br>
And he wants to ensure a free and open internet by having an un-elected Gubbmint bureaucracy, The FCC, to regulate the Internet!??!?!?<br>
He believes the free and open and awesome system we NOW have, should be changed by allowing further Bureaucratic power to the Gubbmint.<br>
Does Valiums even THINK about the consequences of his ideas?<br>
Is he even aware how contradictory his statements are?<br>
<br>
Let the FCC in. Let them TAX and Regulate all they like.<br>
Say goodbye to 4Chan.<br>

	<div class="content">The problem with the US system is mostly about the customers. You see it is just like 3G or anything. We want to pay 1 price and have unlimited use but we make absolutely no attempt to reasonably ration our use. So the companies have no reason to want to deliver a faster connection because people are mostly unwilling to pay for it and it would just increase the load on their servers and not result in added profits.  Back in the day when I was a young one we used to compress everything we emailed or sent because many people paid by band width. We did not just download a movie because it was free and we might use it some day. Alot of other countries still operate like this. But right now what people do is they want to pay 1 low price for unlimited use and then they want to use the shit out of it. ISPs and carriers have to deal with it because if they said you have to pay for a certain amount everyone jumps ship to the guy who says unlimited. <br>
<br>
I know I am in the minority but I would much rather pay for use. IE a set reasonable price per GB plus administrative fees. So like 10$ per month plus 50 cents per GB. Then the companies would be encouraged to increase the speed of the connection because it would get people to use more and cause them to profit more. And people would think about how they are using the internet they would not just download all kinds of junk they will never watch or listen to. If you wanted to you could run a server right out of your house. The only penalty to you would be increased costs. <br>
<br>
Also net neutrality is a complicated subject. It will never be entirely neutral I think in my pay per bandwidth system it would be less of an issue. You would have less file sharers clogging up the pipes because it would costs them to do so and may not be worth it. And even if they were they would be paying for their share. I believe that ideally every packet should be sent through in the order received. But some packets really are not as important as others. For instance a bit torrent of a movie that is being downloaded overnight is not as important as a packet going to a HL2DM server. Also a major virus break out can bog down things and I really see no reason why spam emails from zombie machines should not be moved to the back of the list and even blocked. <br>
<br>
In the end it is the customer not the ISPs or governments that really controls the system. The average American has no clue what connection speed they have, they have no clue what they would do with a faster speed, and the only thing they really care about is getting on the internet for a fixed costs. Until the customer demands more it will not be delivered.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You think the solution to our free falling broadband crisis is to impose more fees? Our ISP companies far eclipse in profit any of the ISP's who provide coverage for France, or for Mexico and yet they lead us...In Japan where the internet is not only far cheaper but their ISP companies make far less then we do have 32x the internet speed we have.

yes I do think it would solve many problems though not all. People would pay for what they get where as now what happens is everyone pretty much pays the same rate but different people use very different amounts of the service. And the service itself varries heavily depending on what time of day or the load on the network is. Let me ask you this have you ever had a great meal at a buffet? I have not, if you give everyone a 1 price fits all service you can bet the service will be something less than great. Most of the people do not notice if they are only doing face book but they are in fact paying way more than they should to subsidize the costs of the file monger next door. Also have you checked your stats if you used my pricing plan above most of you would probably be paying less than you currently pay. It is all about motivation but in the end the customers define the motivation as they have the end say in how they shop. I run a business so I know there are lots of times I feel I need to charge more to stay afloat for a product but the customers do not seem to respond well. But then I charge way to much for another item and the customers do not seem to care. The psychology of people is jacked up unfortunately nothing will ever change that. Take cell phone companies, most customers are not willing to pay a reasonable rate per minute instead they have all turned to a jacked up system where they give you X amount free and then rape you for over charges and texts. Why is it that customers have chosen this system over a simple pay per minute system?<br>
<br>
Also as for comparisons forget it. Every different country has a different system because they have different needs. People often cite countries like japan, korea and sweeden. But each of those countries is only the size of 1 of our states. And in all cases the population is heavily concentrated in the cities. If you go into US cities that are dense they have much better internet than the average rates cited. We are more spread out and so it costs more. Not only that but we are simply a much bigger country a small country like that can upgrade faster or layout a new system because it simply costs them orders of magnitude less and takes less time and organization.<br>
<br>
There is one thing we could do to help the problem with out a pay structure change or any net neutrality. We could tell the government to get out and stop sanctioning monopolies. Out side of very big or tech savy cities there is usually only 1 major provider in the form of a cable company which has a license others will ask to build and will be denied. So simply allowing more competition in would help. They need to force the cable companies to share lines like they did with the long distance companies before. The major problem is actually the government is so slow to either change the system or get out of the way. They figured out they had to fix it with the ATT phone monopoly but no one out there is talking about the fact that Cable is the fastest option in most areas and in those areas the cable company usually has a monopoly that the government allows to exist by not allowing other companies to build out lines or use the existing lines.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

-What free falling broadband crisis!??! From where does this come. There is a CRISIS in US Broadband?<br>
I don't think so. I don't see any crisis. I haven't seen any reporting of any crisis nor evidence of any crisis.<br>
-When you say far eclipse in profits, what do you mean?! How do you know this? If they have huge amounts of excess bandwidth, i should say they SHOULD make less profit. And if Comcast is 4 times bigger, 4 times the profits is a one to one comparison on scale.<br>
-They lead us?  Lead us in what? Lower price per unit of bandwidth? Quality? Coverage? Reliability?<br>
-ISPs don't write monopolistic contracts. The State and local Gubbmints do that. True monopolies only happen when the gubbmint allows it or there is an illegal trust. Are you saying the major ISPs are trusts? Funny, in VA Beach, you can sign up with Verizon, or Cox, and three different satellite companies and number of Dial-up companies. There is no monopoly on Internet service.<br>
-You have a problem with PROFITS. For some reason, you believe profits are your business. There are not.<br>

I believe it is called Greed.  <br>
<br>
The same can be said of many U.S. companies.   Too many of them put thier profits in their pockets and pay their C.E.O.s huge bonuses instead of investing in R&amp;D and newer technologies until some foreign company does it and starts to take over thier market share.  Example: U.S. vs Japanese car companies and the development of feul efficient cars.  It took gas going to almost $5 a gallon (admittedly still less than many other countries) in the U.S., and people buying Toyotas and Hondas to get the U.S. companies to get off their ass and make a real feul efficient car, not a pseudo efficient car. <br>
<br>
Another example: Outboard engines for boats.  Foreign makers were the first to make 4 stroke outboards while U.S. manufacterers continued to make the dirtier, less feul efficient, noiser 2 strokes.  Years ago, U.S. made engines, such as Johnson were once great products but due to the lack of innovation and in the name of profit, the became cheaply made and with horrible record for breakdowns.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is one thing we could do to help the problem with out a pay structure change or any net neutrality. We could tell the government to get out and stop sanctioning monopolies. Out side of very big or tech savy cities there is usually only 1 major provider in the form of a cable company which has a license others will ask to build and will be denied. So simply allowing more competition in would help. They need to force the cable companies to share lines like they did with the long distance companies before. The major problem is actually the government is so slow to either change the system or get out of the way. They figured out they had to fix it with the ATT phone monopoly but no one out there is talking about the fact that Cable is the fastest option in most areas and in those areas the cable company usually has a monopoly that the government allows to exist by not allowing other companies to build out lines or use the existing lines.</div></blockquote></div></blockquote>

Hey everything you said rang true, free competition is what is needed and is sorely missing. I don't think you guys understand the power of contracting, and how lawyered up these 4 ISP kings are, they have the power to not let in a newer company in a 100 mile radius of a city if they wanted with their dazzling and complex contracts done by the best legal minds in America...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, deregulation in the UK for instance allowed private interests to offer much more in terms of competitive pricing and service, but it has been the government who has been driving the push for technology including the internet and digital tv. Lets remind ourselves of the recent debate on <strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">phorm</em></strong> (based on clean feed) technology proposed by BT where it tracks all your browsing and stores it! . It works by connecting directly into your ISP’s network, intercepting communications between you and the sites you visit, to check which things you are looking at.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> like a private version of echelon! the other side of the coin in Russia (as China has already been mentioned), where:  <br>

His main function is to keep his finger on the pulse of the Russian internet, by monitoring everything that appears in electronic publications and popular blogs.

	<div class="content">I pick up the Virginian Pilot today and there is a big article about Verizon FIOS.<br>
<br>
Cox is a local cable provider that reaches most all the Hamptons Roads cities. <br>
Virginia State law REQUIRES that no provider get a better contract on local municipalities right of way to establish laying networks.<br>
Verizon has spent 24 billion on FIOS since 2004.<br>
They are required to reach a certain amount of households in each city based on density.<br>
Verizon has balked at some arrangements because it is offered the same deal as Cox.<br>
Meaning, they get the same deal to lay FIOS, a much improved tech over Cox's older cable system.<br>
<br>
Lawyers at Major ISPs do not make the rules. The Federal, State and local gubbmint make the rules. ISPs negotiate but are beholden to local law.<br>
This stuff about high powered lawyers at ISPs is nonsense. It is a complete distortion of how business takes place.<br>
<br>
So, I see that Verizon has spent 24 Billion dollars since 2004 implementing Fiber Optics.<br>
This flies directly counter to Valiums assertions about spending profits to improve systems.<br>
Amazing!<br>
<br>
I also see that local/state law dictates terms of contracts for right of way.<br>
And to wire England or Japan isn't quite as daunting as wiring the United States.<br>
America is bigger than all of Europe and more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah I have to agree with Impala on the Fios thing.  Verizon did put some bucks into it to develop it.  I just wish I could get it where I am  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> .  That said, I have to wonder though that if not for the cable companies having faster internet over regular DSL, if Verizon would have spent the money in the first place.   As I alluded to in my last post, competition does force companies to innovate or they get left in the dust.   Not sure how much it has helped Verizon though because most people seem to have cable instead of Fios, at least around here where both Fios and cable is available.  Where Fios is not available, everyone (except me) has cable.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I know there must be thrfdfsdillions of posts written about this old controversy, but I'm curious about it and I don't wanna read loose posts on threads in which this is slightly or totally offtopic. Besides, I'm too sleepy atm to go look for it  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> Forgive me.<br>
<br>
Now, I've been against toggle_zoom for the most part of my hl2dm carrear (about a yr and a half), but recently I tried it and I liked it. <br>
<br>
The reason I tried it, is cuz I could never find a freakin decent key where to bind normal zoom to. Side mouse buttons are out of the question for a hold fuction, and the default Z key seems pretty much impossible for me to use at all. <br>
All other keys around WASD are binded to something already so I have no chances for more of anything. And anything that is two keys away from D or W is too far for me to reach handily, except R. And perhaps V (with thumb) but I still never used it so far.<br>
<br>
It's true that my sniping abilities went up a bit. Not that much cuz I've always managed pretty well (or just as bad) without zoom, but they did went up a bit.<br>
It seems a bit contradicting in my mind that I'm using something that I was severely against for much time. Reminds me of being a real bugger to my mother when I was a kid for her to quti smoking, only to become a persistent smoker myself a few years later.<br>
<br>
Now although I was against it, I've never considered it an exploit, or at least not a "harmfull" one. I've always considered it as much or as little an exploit as binding the wheel to jump, using phys_swap, changing rates, preventing weapon change on pick up, setting the prefered default weapon, taking out quick info, or anything else that may be similar. In my honest opinion.<br>
<br>
I also read once (in steam forums, I think) someone's post saying "Onti was one of the first players to ever use toggle_zoom exclusively". This made me feel a bit more confortable with it, since I came to believe that Onti was a cool player that wouldn't rely on anything that would be so much of a bad thing. An example player, I mean.<br>
<br>
I dont know what to ask you about it, so I'll just leave it up to you to coment on this if you want.<br>
I think I basically need to know on what side toggle_zoom is in the community.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ive had a bind for it since i first learned about it.  like anything new, i overused it and gradually found it to be not all that useful.  for competitive maps (small to medium), i rarely use it at all.  mostly because, i am trying to be constantly on the move and dont camp for more than the briefest amount of time.  it does have limited use in 1v1 scrims when i can camp a little longer or camp a particular bottle-neck without having to worry about multiple enemies.<br>
<br>
now in pubs, especially large maps or maps with those hidden snipe havens... the toggle_zoom is pretty fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yea, I rarely use it in dm too.<br>
I play some ctf maps daily and that's where I find it more useful to snipe here and there and now and then. In dm is practically useless to zoom, either toggle or not.<br>
I never got used to zoom much tho. I hardly ever play sniper maps... it's boring.<br>
<br>
Funny that I got a warning in the ctf server, that toggle_zoom is considered an exploit there.<br>
I refuse to change it just because of my disagreement about it being an exploit, rather than just for arguing about it. Which I didn't, btw.<br>
I know they dont ban me there without a 2nd thought, but if they do, well, tuff.<br>
<br>
And that was what triggered my mind to make this post that I had in mind for some time already.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 Its coded into the entire source engine even OB I have played a few mods that forgot to dissable it.<br>
Speaking of anti cheat plugins thsi happend a few days ago LOL<br>

if you wanted to improve this you would add a script to each of your weapons so if you switched to ANYTHING you would rebind m2 to secondary fire, and then could have m2 stay as toggle zoom when you were using for example the magnum, so you could zoom back out with the same button. scripts r bad mmkay.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I used it a lot when I was first giving it a try,but then I almost never used it, cuz I mainly played stock/competitive maps, and most of them aren't that big to justify the need to zoom imo (if you like doing so sure, keep at it, whatever floats your boat ;P).

<blockquote><div><cite>The Argumentalizer wrote:</cite>Some of those folks would just headshot you all day.</div></blockquote>And that's pretty much my part in there (except when I'm in another one of those days...)<br>

So there's not much I gotta get used to in there, if anything at all. I play in that server for almost 2 years. I've mostly overcome the spam whore's, and mag whore's aren't that much of a threat anymore.<br>
This wasn't about being owned or owning, or having noobs or not to fight, it was about someone realising (spec) I was using toggle_zoom and reporting to an admin that happened to be there atm.<br>

And I didn't say there's ctf noobs, I said there's noobs playing in their server. These noobs are just plain noobs, ppl that just started playing this game and many don't even know they are playing ctf or even what the hell is ctf. Those ppl is what I'm saying they try to protect from just quiting the game for good from getting frustrated cuz of easy-kill-seakers. Which I'm not.

	<div class="content">Unless the server specifically says "NO USING TOGGLE_ZOOM EVEN THOUGH ITS AVAILABLE TO USE" you should have no problem. Thats what I dont get, people complaining about things in game that are available to you. I had someone once complain about how fast I was able to switch weapons. I said "well check your advanced options and you can be switching just as fast." If I remember correctly, they complained about it being cheap or something. People will bitch about anything to make themselves look better.<br>
<br>
And as long as Im on the subject of that, I joined this server called the AMM clan server or something. They had no motd so I couldnt see any specific rules. I went in there playing as normal as i could with low gravity and got a lesson from some hillbilly ass kid with an IQ of less than 10 about how I couldnt join spectate. "Only admins can join spectate...you understand me?"<br>
<br>
It's the 5th time this week I've been banned by some idiot who thinks he knows how to run a server. Don't get me started on the people who ban me for having complete air control on low gravity servers and them not being able to hit me. "It's not fair for you to be able to move like that. We cant hit you" Then change your fucking settings already so it's not so easy for me to own you when your floating through the air and so its easier for you to hit me when im not doing 600 velocity circles around your head.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">lol, I laugh a lot when kids spend "hours" saying anything and everything they can to make their point which in the end basically is "I'm admining this server". That's so hilarious  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
That reminds me of this funniest kid some days ago, saying he was admin in the jumpserver, and he could ban me and even using all the F words, but he didn't cuz he was a good guy and he was in a good mood, and insisted over and over again that he was admin bla bla bla, and he was gonna ban me if I didn't shut the fuck up "you fucker", till I said I was the one doing the admining there. And he said no I was not (about 10 times), and when I slaped him for abusing F and MF words, he left.<br>
LOL OMFFG<br>
<br>
Admining a jumpserver with noblock, nokill, keeper impulse plugin, etc, is pretty straightforward ^^. Theres not much to worry about, only the frustrated and verbally agressive and offensive kids(?) and mostly the mic spammers. I like that  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

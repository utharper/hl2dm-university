	<div class="content">I'm sure there's plenty of fans of Gears of War and/or American Chopper.  For those of you that don't know, Paul Jr. of Paul Jr. Designs built a "Wicked Sick" trike for the Gears of War 3 game just released and it's insanely impressive!!<br>

I wouldn't say so, I gave stuff and received stuff from people I haven't met - it's just clear and obvious when someone is just an all around faggot and panic is one of them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Panic even gave this long guilt trip about some 'family member' being sick and his car being in dire need of repair. <br>
Killer_K was just a open, genuine, person who got conned by the anonymity of the interwebz. <br>

	<div class="msg">
	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">It's pretty neat how you all know so much about my life, even more than I myself personally knew! For one, yes I did borrow money from Killer K, which I am very grateful for, for two, I have paid back 85% of what I owe him already, so the fact that you all go around making assumptions that I spent it on drugs is really fun, especially when I'm legally prescribed painkillers and I only pay $1 for them thanks to medicaid, so yeah, saying I spent the money on drugs is really valid I'd say.<br>
<br>
I have since spoken to Killer K on steam, and he understands why I haven't been around and is no longer mad at me, as for the 'several' others that I borrowed money from, I've already paid them back in full, so yeah, I really go around burning everyone. None of you know anything about what is going on in my life, and you have no room to make any assumptions. For one, Newguy literally used to spam this website with bots and do all kinds of other immature dumbass shit, so I think it's pretty humorous that he's actually trying to be a member of this community, really funny. The only reason I hadn't spoken to Killer K was because I didn't have the rest of what I owe him, which he knows now and understands, even though none of this is any of your business, Killer K has apologized to me himself for posting here.<br>
<br>
I was going through a really bad time, and Killer K helped me out, I am grateful for that, and the only reason I haven't paid him back in full yet is because I'm still going through a pretty shitty time in my life, which none of you would know anything about, once again, so making assumptions still have absolutely no validity. I could come on here, and post shit about your personal life too TNG, some really personal shit I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want people to know, but I'm not going to stoop to your level, because I'm more mature than that. I think you're a very smart guy newguy and you're pretty misunderstood, but the fact that you would come on here and literally slander me in front of the whole community is pretty sad. I'm not mad at you, because frankly, I deserved some of this for not being around, but now I AM around, I've spoken to Kenny and worked everything out, so the fact that you would still come on here and make a post like that is pretty appalling. I understand that you and Killer K are friends and that you're trying to look out for him, but maybe you should've spoken to him first before you came on here and spread even MORE rumors about me.<br>
<br>
I would like to make a personal apology to dbanimal for derailing your post as well, and as for everyone else, you can honestly think whatever you want about me or what happened, but I can tell you right now I never had any intention of ripping anyone off, ever, I was wholeheartedly grateful for the fact that he helped me in the first place because I had no one to turn to in real life, and I've been extremely depressed over the whole situation because I can't pay him back everything yet, but that still does not negate the fact that I HAVE paid him back most of what I owe him already, and I'm doing everything I can to get the rest of it. You all can literally think whatever the fuck you want for all I care, I know whats the truth and what isn't. I apologize to the whole community for this as well, I never wanted any of this shit to happen, and the fact that it happened at all is really shitty, but theres nothing that can be done to change that now. I'm sorry everyone, I'm sorry for the fact that you all make judgements based on rumors about me, go around telling everyone including Killer K that I'm a drug addict, and I'm sorry that it's taken me so long to reply to this topic, I haven't had internet at my house and I'm not going to have it back on until tomorrow. I deserved a lot of what was said in this post, and that's fine with me, I just wanted to say I'm sorry to the community as a whole, and I AM going to be paying Killer K the rest of what I owe him within the next week, so once that is done with I hope we can all just move passed this, and just get back to shooting at eachother rather than spreading wild rumors and talking shit on a forum.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The same could be said for Apple and Windows and a lot of linux distributions. I'm not sure I want to use anymore Google products. I already use their search engine, photo management and email services, they have enough information about me already without me running their os. <br>
<br>
The release of this will hopefully cause a decrease in the use of Windows, which let's face it, can only be a good thing for the I.T. world.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think it's an awesome concept and would be prefect for netbooks, but not for general usage...well not yet. I like the whole idea of cloud computing and the ability to have your files and favourites where ever you go, however I'm still a bit uneasy about how secure that information is and it only being 1 password away for being in the hands of someone else.<br>
<br>
But in saying that I do trust Google to a certain extent and I do have a strong password and as an Android user I already use Google Contacts, Calender, Docs, Maps/Latitude, Talk, Mail all from my phone so if I had the opportunity to have a netbook running Chrome OS I'd take it over one running windows...All I'd have to do is sign in and boooom there's all my shit, no installing, no waiting, no fucking around, just easy peasy!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I get where they are going with this but it is far to early in the game for it. Making the right product is not just about making it most people half a brain know where the future is headed, but it is about pulling it off at the right time. It was way to early when apple dropped the floppy drive and it is to early to have google OS which is basically a thin client. I also kinda think this is bad for another reason. Lots of people think that computers can and cannot do certain things simply because their computer sucks hardware wise, or sucks OS wise. In this case it would be because it sucks OS wise. What we really need is the OS to feature more not less and do more so people can stop wasting money on hundreds of products which all do things the computer can already do. (gamine consoles, ereaders, and so on). You could easily imagine this getting big with netbooks because after all with google docs the basic things a nieve unskilled computer user does can all be covered. So then you have people who think that computers are not capable of more advanced tasks. They may also think they are slow since it is mostly web based.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Most dumb ass users will not be able to handle Google's OS because they are dumb asses. Most people can't operate in a Window's OS setting so jumping to google's OS would be overwhelming for them.<br>
<br>
As for the OS itself, looks like a lot of google crap that I dont really care for. Do people actually use google talk? lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">seems to me running something that is Open Source would make it quite a bit easier for botnets and hackers to create new attacks in a much more timely fashion.  All the newbies will most likley be learning their destructive internet skills playing with these open source programs.<br>
<br>
As for apple/mac/linux/unix/googlechrome --- Its been common knowledge for awhile now that MS is a target by everyone --- so many use the FIREFOX and the OPERA browsers and wut nots.  Their time is coming, if anything, since they havent been 'targeted' as much.  Perhaps their built in phising and antivirus arent detecting like they should, since theres never been any real targeting against them, how could they know what to look for- for that specific app, and if it's open source, the possibities seem pretty endless to me. <br>
<br>
Heuristic analysis for finding new threats ---- I have no faith in that crap.<br>
<br>
just a personel and rather uneducated opinion.  <br>
<br>
then again, common sense is usually the best defence.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

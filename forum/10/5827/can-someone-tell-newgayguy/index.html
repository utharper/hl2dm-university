There's a few fun things I've learned as a part native american is that there are racists on both sides. However being as I've been in/on about 5 different reservations I don't know of any Native supremacy groups of actively work to suppress the white/black/latino race.<br>
<br>
The big difference is one group has the ability to use the racism to detrimental effects, the other does not. Secondly the white racists and native racists I've met tend to pretty dumb/poor. I guess I wasn't surprised when they came out with a study recently where they tested a group of people and found the poorer and dumber (tested by IQ) you were, the more racist and religious you tended to be.<br>
<br>
Fear and religion = GG (for all races seems to be a deadly combo)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When did I say it's contingent on race, if you really want to get down to eugenics East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews consistently tested higher in IQ tests in the few studies that got done before shutting them down, even today average mean SAT, LSAT and MCAT scores still have these two particular races testing the highest. I guess they have the most superior cultural norms and success of any on earth, even more so then the WASP? Once again you just drag a bunch of completely unrelated ideas into the conversation.<br>
<br>
 I was talking broadly in a study that include many races at once <a href="http://www.clubs.psu.edu/up/sayar/riqs.htm" class="postlink">http://www.clubs.psu.edu/up/sayar/riqs.htm</a> (I have the article on JSTOR but I don't think you guys can access it) religiosity and racism positively correlated with lower IQ's, that was my only point. Yes all races demonstrate racism, but as your intelligence goes up, the less religious, the less racist you are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Jews still rank first in average IQ tests today, rank number 1 in average household income, rank 1 in education levels and education scores. East asians second in almost all of those. Apparently if wealth and success are the measurement you go by, Jews have been conquering whites for some time now.<br>
<br>
Edit; note I refer to American/Ashkenazi Jews. Interestingly enough Israeli Jews score well below their Ashkenazi counterparts in all of those areas globally, IQ wise by 10 points.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sound logic, so I guess all those tests on chimps that the same humans were subjected to that shows chimps not even having half the memory power, reasoning power and logic power is bullshit right? Those tests show nothing and chimps could very well be as smart or smarter then us I guess. I guess quantifying amount of brain matter, brain development and number of neurons that directly correlates and even predicts intelligence is also bullshit and not objective too right?<br>

It can, Deep Blue when it beat Kasparov was programmed to make it's own "creative" choices if it did not find a suitably strong move when confronted with a line of moves it did not have programmed for a response. Deep Blue proved to be stronger both creatively and efficiency wise, but it had massive amounts of data and machinery programmed just for one single game.<br>
<br>
The point is over time people are projecting a Deep Blue for the entire world is not that far off, a computer that can both simulate and create all possible circumstances based on our laws of physics and nature. This AI will even have the ability to make it's own decisions, and if it "likes' a decision it makes the computer will compound the new decisions with another new decision on top of the one it just made.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The information is incomplete. Computers are based in Information. With the existing set of tools they WILL arrive at dead ends eventually as do we.<br>
The Human fear of this super computer taking over the planet is the same primal fear we have of Witches and Poisoned Apples:<br>
<br>
"the computer compounds its abilities to understand much more then we can" - you're basically saying: :...uh...and then it makes up the rest...uh...somehow...(i guess)"<br>
There is no "rest" or "somehow" for computers because rest and somehow cannot be written in code.<br>
<br>
Computer Rule of thumb: 01<br>
Man rule of thumb: ... .. . .. .. .  .. . .<br>
<br>
Vals, you cannot quantify Human intelligence when you've only discovered less than 15% of Human DNA and understand less than 2% of Human brain functions AND, as you mention: have only understood less than 1% of Nature on its rules, be it Physics, Chemistry, Biology and so on.<br>
Hence, the computers you can build off of that partial information will never be "super" other than Super Fast and Super Efficient WITHIN the incomplete frame of information you gave them.<br>
Let's come back and discuss what do to when Super Computers take over the planet when a 12 DNA coils fully lit and mapped Human with full 100% mapped brain builds them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's the difference. <br>
<br>
Computers don't have the structural limit like the human brain does (they can always be updated or have more processing structure integrated on the chip), chips will soon vastly outpace the processing power of the brain, and even the creativity of the human brain.<br>
<br>
Automation has replaced roughly 60% of American manual labor jobs (and will continue to replace more), something Fox News won't tell you because they blame all job loss on illegal immigrants, outsourcing and debt. There is no stopping the strength of AI unless we stop it ourselves. Never was there a more appropriate time to post a picture of John Conner then now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Say you're drilling an area and one day the drill stops and you realize you've found an underground chamber. maybe an oil or gas dump..<br>
Then, without further investigation and regardless of not knowing what it is and how much you have there you go ahead and start putting options for Gas and Oil stocks. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

srsly no offense but i don't think you fully understand what Creativity truly is and the stage of Human scientific knowledge of the universe.<br>

If you go to a new country and learn to say Hi and Thank You, you can't go ahead and write essays on their language IN their language: you just know how to say Hi and Thank You: not only are you missing the vocabulary you also have no grasp of context and cultural root of this new found language.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The brain and a CPU are similar in some regards.  But the brain is biological, it's not digital and its memory areas are also used for processing and creative thinking, all in one.  CPU's, in order to have memory, need some RAM, in order to do something creative, need intelligence.  CPU's are simply thousands of circuits called logic gates, that is all.<br>
<br>
Check this out: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/gero_miesenboeck.html" class="postlink">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/gero_miesenboeck.html</a><br>
It's highly interesting, but if you want, skip to 16:30.  He basically talks about how they have nailed down where the 'Critic' in the brain lies to 12 cells.  But they still don't understand through physical interactions, how intelligence springs to life; how the critic does its job.<br>
<br>
The idea of software programming itself to improve itself is also an interesting idea, but a fairy tale to me.  This is learning.  Learning does not happen without a critic or some intelligence.  Learning may be hard-coded into a program.  But that program only learns to the extent for which it is programmed.  i.e. AI in games.  I can program a piece of logic to reprogram itself, but it will only be able to learn/reprogram itself to the extent I hard-coded in.<br>
<br>
Also, there are very many smart people that believe in a god, there are also numerous smart people that do not believe in a god.  The majority of scientists are either agnostic or atheist, but there are still some that are religious.  My speculation is, the more you break down what's going on in our physical world, and the more you understand how things work, the veil and the mystique that religion offers starts to disappear like a thick fog in the morning sun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes I took a look into it and the software wasn't what I initially thought it was. It's typical however that once someone makes one mistake the rest of their arguments are dismissed, like little flies looking for any hole to crack, because the rest of my links were so bad right? It's great all the people dismissing my other links as nonsense have yet to produce any real counter argument worth any value.<br>

again, it depends on your view of "intelligence."  the person(s) that worked on creating the very first CPU couldnt do the mathmatical calculations it could do, or certainly not as fast.  so....in a sence it was more intelligent than its creators if you think that is what makes something intelligent.  there are many more examples of varying direction, but you get my point.  <br>

as for "It's like saying you are smarter than god."  thats a path we probably shouldnt even start on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes I took a look into it and the software wasn't what I initially thought it was.

You're looking for a counter argument to eugenics? Lol you don't have to look very far.<blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%">The results of heritability studies have been used to support the argument that intelligence is mainly innate and inherited, citing heritability values of 0.8 for intelligence. In most cases, however, the reasoning used to support this argument misuses the concept of heritability. Recall that a measured heritability of 0.8 (for example) means that 80% of the phenotypic variation observed is due to genetic differences within that population. Heritability differences between two populations cannot be compared, because heritability measures only variation within a population at the time of measurement. By definition, it cannot be used to estimate genetic variation between populations. In other words, we cannot use heritability differences between groups to conclude that there are genetic differences between those groups. As we will see in Chapter 19, genetic variation within any single population is much greater than the amount of genetic variation between any two populations. In fact, the amount of genetic variation within a population is so great that it swamps the genetic differences between populations, invalidating the idea that human populations can be sorted into racial groups.</span></div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No? I never argued that I believe in eugenics, nor that it's a legitimate concept.<br>
<br>
If you read my posts carefully you'd know I was taking a potshot at Impala's implied assertion of WASP (AKA white) superiority by the criterion of "success" and "wealth".<br>
<br>
I was making fun of him by simply stating the fact American Jews score the highest in IQ tests of any American racial group average, have the highest median household income and highest levels of education and education scores (SAT, MCAT, LSAT ect).<br>
<br>
I myself don't believe in eugenics, I do believe culture and cultural xenophobia creates pockets of pseudo races that in reality don't differ much genetically then the rest of the human population, if at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

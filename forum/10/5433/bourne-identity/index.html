<br>
SO, how the fuck is he clean shaven after weeks of running from whatever!?!?!<br>
Weeks later, without a razor anywhere, Jason Bourne is a clean shaven Matt Damon Fratboy faggot with a clean face!?!?!<br>
<br>
WTF!<br>
Did anyone read the book and see a wimpy Damon, with his short little stub arms as David Webb/Bourne!?!?<br>

	<div class="content">There have been some ridiculous adaptations.<br>
<br>
Starship Troopers. The book starts with a gritty infantry assault with jump suits, bounding over buildings, destroying the city center of the enemy. What better start for movie!?!? It WOULD have been awesome. But no.<br>
Rather than a dirty gritty violent tale of Infantry, we get fresh faced Nickelodeon jerks and a sappy love triangle.<br>
And the whole Civics side, that made the book controversial, nowhere to be found.<br>
What a poiece of crap this.<br>
<br>
Bourne Identity: Jeeez. Where was the book? Bourne is NOT Bourne. He is David Webb, a Vietnam Special Forces agent trained by the CIA to lure Carlos the Jackal out. He is not really an assassin. Rather than spend time developing the plot, they develop fancy bogus silly CIA black Ops, with instant access to any database and real-time access to street cameras, and a phony plot with Adibezi from OZ, which screws everything up when he is involved.<br>
They then make the same exact non-story-no-plot hit two more times.<br>
<br>
I Am Legend: Is anyone aware that the crux of the book is that the sole survivor is actually the Vampire preying on mankind, who have all become vampires? A reverse vampire story. Where the hell was that!?!? I actually enjoyed this one though.<br>
<br>
Dune. Visually stunning, minus the cheap special effects. I felt sorry for any folks who didn't read the books.<br>
I imagine every one of them were all like "WTF is happening!?!" Who are these witches? Why are they manipulating genetics!?!<br>
Why is Sting in this!?! Why is it raining at the end!?!?! Huhhhhhh.<br>
<br>
Any Bond Movie after Thunderball except Casino Royale, which is tight, realistic, and captures the book. The rest of them are mostly so ridiculous... and Roger Moore!?!?! Timothy Dalton!?!?  WTH!<br>
<br>
The Road. Did anyone read the book? Why does he continue to treat his son like a little girl and act like everything will be ok?<br>
Why does he leave the bomb shelter and all that food and protection!?<br>
And the Hollywood end!? Awful.<br>
<br>
Two series i believe could achieve huge success if done right are Necroscope and the Sten series by Chris Bunch and Allen Cole.<br>
I urge anyone who likes to read to get Sten. He is awesome and there are many dirty tricks and lots of action.<br>
Amazing reads.<br>

Necroscope could scare the pants off the world.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Another huge failure that hits close to my heart is The Spirit.<br>

The Road is a star case of a HORRIBLE movie made from a genius book, from a genius author. Cormac McCarthy who wrote it is one of very few living legends of American authors we have left, and the only movie that did 1/2 of justice to his immense writing skills was No Country for Old Men, but even there the movie cuts out most of his genius.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

nah, the original is better. while the new version is very good, it didn't have all the dark humor that was present in the original. <br>

And it's cheap looking.<br>
The acting is bad.<br>
The script isn't great.<br>
<br>
The remake definitely is a far superior movie.<br>
.</div></blockquote>
maybe you haven't seen the original in a while. it's hilarious. and of course it looks cheap with green makeup. it's called low budget. thats what makes it 'good.'</div></blockquote>

Fix'd it for ya. I get where you're coming from but cheap and cheesy can't alone justify the greatness of a movie.<br>
<br>
..Unless you're the worst sci fi movie EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF FILM. Then there is no hope.</div></blockquote>
it can justify greatness when the film in particular is pioneering an entire genre. do you think that if they remade the evil dead trilogy with awesome cgi effects and whatnot, it would be better than the originals? no. because thats what makes them good. they are campy. they are over the top cheesy. they are actually scary.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">When Dawn came out, nobody said it was a fantastic movie. There was a lot of talk about the helicopter incident and the gang hacking zombies and snickers at the gore. The original Night of the... is a better movie in my opinion.<br>
Romero released a much longer cut that is even tedious.<br>
What is memorable is the MALL. <br>
<br>
The remake takes off like a bat out of hell and hardly slows down. <br>
The husband turning.<br>
The neighborhood sequence is pretty horrifying.<br>
The woman in the wheel barrow!? <br>
The birth scene.<br>
The conflict with CJ.<br>
The drive out.<br>
The end.<br>
That movie is full of awesome stuff, far better than the original.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have to disagree o this one.<br>
<br>
One of the best things about I Am Legend is how solitary he was and the only sort of conversation was with one of the vampires, even if the vampire just constantly mocked him. I was kinda upset how they randomly introduced a couple of new characters.<br>
<br>
Personally The Omega Man was a better adaptation of that book.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

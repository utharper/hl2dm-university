	<div class="content">So I was moving my rig into a new case with a new power supply and i got everything set up... then... As I hooked everything up... The fans would spin, no bios or nuthin. I tinkered with it all day yesterday and gave up. took it to best buy this morning and after like 30 minutes of ooking it over with someone else... we concluded that the motherboard died..<br>
so. I wont be around much and wont be in the draft night this sunday. sucks to be me but I'm working on the repairs. any tips for all of this reparing that I'll be doing?<br>
<br>
Wish me luck.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah... I made sure that It was not mounted directly on the case...<br>
the possible reasons could be..<br>
1. The board just died during the transfer<br>
2. The sudden surge from a new power supply could have done something<br>
3. Messing around with the jumpers for the power switch, reset switch and LED lights did something.<br>
<br>
Its still a mystery to me tho.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yea I had to replace the MB on mine a couple of months ago because one of the the ram slots or video card slots went bad.  I had to reinstall my OS after because the OS didnt want to recognize the new MB for some stupid reason.  <br>
<br>
If you have a separate storage drive, disconnect it if you do have to reinstall the OS.  I have 3 separate physical drives:  2 are 150 gig raptors in a raid 0 and another 300 gig Caviar for storage and my "slow" programs that dont need the speed of the raptor/raid. The raid volume is partitioned with separate partitions for the OS and another just for my games.  Well when I went to reinstall the OS with a clean install, it wants to reformat and rename the biggest drive (the storage drive) as C, (Damn Microsoft!!).  <br>
<br>
Well needless to say, I lost all of my stored files.  So I had to disconnect the 300 gig drive to force it to install where I wanted it to be.  Now have a even an additonal external 80 gig backup in case.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">About making sure the MB is isolated from the case.  Those little red washers are a pain in the arse to get to stay on the little stand off bolts that you screw the mb down to.  Here is a tip that worked for me.  Get a glue stick and use it to get the red washers to stick to the top of the bolts.  Let them dry for 30 sec to a min then put the MB on it.  Makes it much easier.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

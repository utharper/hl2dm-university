	<div class="content">So I was chattin with FRANK IN BOSTON who runs the warfare arena and we've been throwing ideas back and forth about his server. Since it is one of the few good remaining pubs left, I'd like to see that it stays in tip top shape. So the questions revolving around are basically:<br>
<br>
mani/mods or no mani/mods and what maps for rotation<br>
<br>
I've taken a look at his maplist.txt and he has well over 100 maps chillin on the server that will more than likely never get played. So I'm in the process of cleaning that up for him but as far as the rest of it goes, I'd like to really see what you guys think of removing mani and just making a simple 10 map stock rotation running smooth as butter. Now, in my personal opinion anyway, mani allows for voting of maps which would and usually does completely remove the need for a specific map cycle to begin with. But since it's the only decent stock map pub available, I'd like to keep all you selfish pricks happy with how it's run. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
So what do you think of mani on it, and what maps would you like to see played?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Point is that pubs dont fill up these days... even half capacity is almost screenshot worthy.<br>
<br>
Also, dm_tigcrik_r2 with 16 players is the bomb. Seriously. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i agree with bi on the small maps.  its good to have them available, but not necessarily in the map rotation.  sometimes its fun to play tig with 10 people... but not followed by la with 10 people, then bio with ten people... etc.  players just spec or leave until they see what the next map is.  i also agree with beef, i prefer a mix of classics and new.  leave it to a vote... so i guess im in the mani camp.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"><br>

whatever the the decision, im sure i'll continue to patronize the Warfare Arena  (except when tiggy is playing, LOL).  it is truly my favorite.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Um all the other lockdowns arent really much different,the textures FAIL so most people have to adjust there video to be able to play it,it added 1 hallway,moved a weapon spawn a few inches,oh and it made it harder to get rpg even though theres an alert ALREADY on the normal version.Yup its worth getting shot over bro yup.You dont even play anymore anyway so it really shouldnt matter shouldnt it?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The most successful pub server in Europe, (Now I'm talking about successful in the way that players of higher lvl was playing on it all the time) was the Ambush server. This is why i think it was successful: <br>
<br>
1. It was never locked. <br>
2. It had never changed IP.<br>
3. It had only a few maps, all well known by the community of a higher lvl.<br>
<br>
Points one and two are kinda self explained. Point three in my opinion are a very important one, you knopw what to expect form that one server. You know you will never have to download or learn a new map. That everyone already knows the map will lead to better standard of the game. The rotation was strict Ld, bio, Lv. Kept like that. Most players found the standard of play so nice that even if you didn't love the map you stayed. There was a fight on the server, what else can you request of a public? <br>
<br>
It was also no rpg for some reason, on the Ambush server. In some way I think this could benefit the server. Me myself don't care what ever weapon the opponent uses but there are some that does. Without the RPG you got rid of all the whine about rpgwhoring. Whit out that whine you get a nicer environment. Another pro with this might have been that without the RPG, you'd find much less map domination. What I mean with this is for example, you play Lv. There's 10 people on the server. There's this guy controlling the map or parts of the map with a RPG. With 10 people on the server weapons tend to not be where you expect em to be, resources are not too accessible. The guy that controls the RPG or a map with it will rtack up spawnkills and easy kills on people without any kind of equipment. <br>
<br>
Getting spawnraped and raped where you have no items by someone who controls a part of the map doesn't give a positive gaming experience to newer players or oldfarts. <br>
<br>
Not that this is wrong, it's as much a part of the game as doing a awesome head shot or summeth like that. It might contribute, it might not to have No RPG. It depends on what you wanna achieve with your server.<br>
<br>
And btw, no freaking plugins. Plugins suck balls. Use rcon, and only on trusted peeps. Keep this a pub, not a server that you use for own needs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I also vote for no-mani, just 'keeper's sound plug-in' if there is to be any at all. <br>
This is similar to the mapcycle I ran at TPS. <br>
However, I also had dm_overwatch and dm_pueblo in there becasue the former was used to bring in 'SoCal' noob-traffic (no, not u blast <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">) and the latter was 'new &amp; exciting' at the time. <br>
I quickly found out that people didn't like pueblo too much for a pub-map and neither did I. <br>
<br>
If there is no plug-ins for a vote, try to run a mapcycle like this. <br>
If there is a vote, this is a good pool to vote from, but be sure to not allow people to vote for the same map they are currently playing. <br>
Voting to extend a map can also be annoying when it is allowed more that once; milieu looks great and all, but playing it for an hour gets mighty tiresome. <br>
In the case of no-vote, have the rounds set at 25 min as well as leave the cycle in alphabetical order so anyone can know what map(s) to expect next. <br>
25 min round time is ideal becasue it is long enough to enjoy a map properly; but if someone does not like a particular map, they don't have to wait too long for it to pass.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I also vote for no-mani, just 'keeper's sound plug-in' if there is to be any at all. <br>
This is similar to the mapcycle I ran at TPS. <br>
However, I also had dm_overwatch and dm_pueblo in there becasue the former was used to bring in 'SoCal' noob-traffic (no, not u blast <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">) and the latter was 'new &amp; exciting' at the time. <br>
I quickly found out that people didn't like pueblo too much for a pub-map and neither did I. <br>
<br>
If there is no plug-ins for a vote, try to run a mapcycle like this. <br>
If there is a vote, this is a good pool to vote from, but be sure to not allow people to vote for the same map they are currently playing. <br>
Voting to extend a map can also be annoying when it is allowed more that once; milieu looks great and all, but playing it for an hour gets mighty tiresome. <br>
In the case of no-vote, have the rounds set at 25 min as well as leave the cycle in alphabetical order so anyone can know what map(s) to expect next. <br>
25 min round time is ideal becasue it is long enough to enjoy a map properly; but if someone does not like a particular map, they don't have to wait too long for it to pass.</div></blockquote>

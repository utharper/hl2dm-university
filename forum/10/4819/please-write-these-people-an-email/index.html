This game is dying (or you may argue it is already dead), so if you care enough about this game to try and save it, write to these magazines and any other PC gaming magazine that you know of that may care enough. I've already written emails to these and I think if we press them hard enough they might listen. cmon people, please, help save this game.<br>
<br>
Valve may not give a shit, maybe these people will.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">what is it you want "saved?"  this game has more servers, maps, tweats, settings, play styles and advanced movement techniques then any MP game out there.  a lot of the stuff we do as advanced players, i have to believe, were never intended by the developers.  i dont think they ever invisioned that players would be fast enough to yo yo a nade/orb in order to reset the timer.  or that we would be able to use a shovel to prop jump across a map.  now you have players manipulating code to make their shotguns 3x more powerful, or so props go right thru you.  you want the developers to put out a patch that removes all these things?  lol, see how many advanced players stick around then.   we have adapted to the game's "faults" in order to make it one of kind.  a game that takes months if not years to fully master.  the gaming state is slowly moving towards consoles because kids now a days are too stupid and/or lazy to learn how to game on a PC.  why do you think patches, games, and DLC's always hit the PC market last?  FFS, look at borderlands, Gearbox's president is a PC gamer, started his career programming.  in essence they are a PC game based company, and the DLC's from them go to console first.  games are also becoming more "dumbed down".  MW2 has got to be the most idiot friendly game ive ever seen.  i hear players in game talking, some dont even know how to bind weapons to keys.  everybody needs "level ups".  trying to attract today's market to a game that doesnt have that, takes a lot of effort to master, requires you can fast weapon switch, etc....is just a wasted effort man.  its just not gonna happen.  lets say those two links you postes got 10,000 emails from players asking them to "save the game"  what would you have them do?  conflict hit the nail on the head,  he is exactly correct.  and if you're "save the game" promotion works and they make it more user friendly, will you still play?  will any of us?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its true, at least half the servers are role play, or coop servers or skull shock.  Most of the rest are killbox, and/or low grav.   Most of us here, dont really play low grav because it blows the advanced movement and techniques that we love and worked so hard to learn right out the window. <br>
<br>
Our prefered version of the game is a very very small part of what is out there as a whole right now.   It has dwindled to almost nothing because its true that new players get pwned too hard in that type of play.  Also I hate to say it, but by and large, we have not very welcoming to new players.  In that aspect, we have sort of done ourselves in.   Many new players have come here and more often than not they get ridiculed and driven out of here.  New players, if they stay in the game, mostly go to low grav or skullshock because its easier for them to get kills.<br>
<br>
While PC gamer does sometimes print articles about old games, it is very unlikley we would get a large influx of new blood into this game if then did a feature for HL2DM for the very reasons stated above.  It goes against the current trend in gaming: newbie friendly, coop, console, low relative skill level/development to get good.<br>
<br>
As far as the mods, CU is using Vanilla HL2DM, so we are staying with HL2DM.  I would like to see what will happen when the OB mod comes out.  AG2 is a mod, but it has weapons that are not in HL2DM which changes the game so its not HL2DM, its AG2.  It seems that people in NA, at least for the moment prefer HL2DM even with its bugs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is only partially true.  I always try and take it easy on new players as I once was one and know how crappy it is to get destroyed over and over.  I'm also very willing to help new players learn new skills and give them pointers.  Many people say that it's good to not give the "noobs" a chance and it will only make them want to work harder.  9 times out of 10 I see them disappearing into a different game, no wonder this game is "supposedly" dieing!!  That's why I will always make an effort to "school" new guys but in a good way so they want to keep coming back for more!  Maybe if more experienced players took this approach then maybe, just maybe, we wouldn't be seeing threads like this!  Just my 2 cents...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You really haven't tried the mod yet now have you. <strong class="text-strong">You can chose playing regular DM with some of the bugfix within AG2</strong>.

It makes sense to play what you are competing with.  Yea I havent tried the AG2 because I dont want to buy/convert a server right now and I am aware of only 1 server in the U.S. and thats in California that plays the vanilla mode.  90+ pings arent much fun to play on with my internet. All of the other servers, get changed to the other version of the game that has the Tau cannon and as I said, its not HL2DM to me.   If it does get to the point that the community starts playing AG2 HL2DM, it and stays with it, then Ill consider going through the trouble to convert or buy a server for it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">@provost   thanks.   I was aware of that thread, but it doesn't appear to be a complete list.  Specifically, I didn't see any mention of the props going through people.  Another bug I didn't see listed is the xbow shooting about 15 degrees off-center.   It happened to me a bunch of times consecutively, so I was able to watch it carefully, but then it went away.  Not sure why or how.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">im getting tired of being beaten over the head with ag2.  ive tried it.  i have the same reservations i had with all previous versions.<br>
<br>
ag2 is ag2.  the players drawn to ag2 play ag2.  go to a server and try to get a vote to change the game to hl2dm.  if you're lucky, you may get to play one map.  usually, you cant get the vote, or people leave as soon as you get the vote and the map changes.<br>
<br>
ag2 players want the ag2 play... tau cannon, jump pack, etc and the myriad of options from arena to instagib.  they dont want hl2dm... at least not in my experience.  ag2 is an excellent mod, but it has too many votable options to make it an hl2dm alternative.  diehard hl2dm'ers will always be in the minority.<br>
<br>
as far as bugs, im not convinced the ag2 hl2dm option is all that much more bug free.  crashes, hitreg, lag, bugs... all seem to be there still.  not sure it could ever be quantified in any convincing manner.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have to tell you guys a story about HLDM. Just to put another nail in the coffin. Back in HLDM one time some web site related to gaming ran a vote to see what was the greatest game of all time or something silly. Well the rage-board (which is the main community for competitive hldm) decided they wanted to show people their game. So they went and sent everyone they knew to vote in this poll. There was of course your typical internet vote cheating (probably from many gamers) and of course bigger games with more people ended up winning. But after the vote alot of people did notice the game because HLDM the game they thought was long gone and small had a much better showing then they anticipated.  In the end admins from CAL took a second look at HLDM and they offered to run a league. In the end hardly any HLDM teams signed up and they screwed up their chance if they even had one. The moral of the story as anyone who has every run a organization knows is that you don't just try to do something unless you are fully prepared to capitalize on it. Because chances are you will only get one chance. And for the record at the time HLDM was far more organized then we were, they had a community driven anti cheat system and web site that linked into servers took stats for the whole community and kicked cheaters, a fair number of anti cheat systems, a real names system that would make it hard for people to fake name or just switch steam ids to become a new person and so on. There were a number of people coding for websites, mods, mapping and so on. The stats systems you guys all use today were developed back in that game. <br>
<br>
You do not take out a super-bowl commercial if you don't have enough product to sell or a website which can handle the traffic. Otherwise your new customers will just run into a frustrating situation and be completely turned off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Dude I can show an screenshot, too. There are several programs that unblock all Steam games, they are very popular in Russia/China/SouthAmerica. The problem is that Steam verifies every time you try to join an original server, so they know that you don't own the game and you are not allowed to join the original game server. But they are plenty of cracked servers so you can actually play the games for free.<br>
<br>
These accounts look legitime until you go to their "/games" in their SteamCommunity ID Profile and see that they actually don't own any game, lol xD<br>
<br>
But, ONTOPIC: That link they gave you is VERY fake.<br>
<br>
First: Why in the hell would Valve give you free games for nothing? Silly thing.<br>
Second: Why in the hell would they use a free host? They already own many .com domains and have extra bandwidth.<br>
Third: I think Valve would never write "steam" instead of "Steam".<br>
Fourth: Any Valve/Steam game takes 12 hours to get activated, and it doesn't matter if you change your password/e-mail.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 Maybe thats it Soiz, maybe he only plays on cracked servers IDK and IDC. The point is there are working ways people are hacking steam and unlocking games. The link my friend used and method is not the one that Valar posted, if you read carefullY I said it was something similar and that there are videos on you tube about how to do it, thats all I know, he used one of those methods and it did work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Dude it's beautiful!  This pack is pretty much the finishing touch of dm..  If you've been playing a long time and have just grown tired of the same ole stuff, download these!  My fave thing is the health, they are really vibrant (c-balls as well) and easy to spot.  Explosions are better, more fire, less smoke, looks very nice. <br>

<br>
Thanks holy, works like a charm, as for FPS and performance, I can't see a difference, I'm sure it lowered a bit but depending on the maps I still average around 80-140 (not much different from before.)  <br>
<br>
I like the hand model as well, there's really nothing I can think of that's bad about this.  Thanks!   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I tested 4 different points in the map in exacty the same spot, looking the exact direction, once with default textures and once with the high definition textures.<br>

Default texture results,<br>

Point #1= 135 frames per second<br>
Point #2= 140 fps<br>
Point #3= 167 fps<br>
Point #4= 170 fps<br>

High definition texture results,<br>

Works really good, and looks really good too like a whole new game.<br>
All 4 points tested contained a lot of items in my FOV along with the new wall, floor and ceiling textures.<br>

No the lag came recently. I've been playing with my antivirus and firewall since I've had the game.<br>

Well Walking Target seems to have the same problem I have and we both have similar cards (7600GT). I updated drivers...haven't really seen if it has helped yet. For a few quick games it has. WT isn't using high res textures and I am. So we don't think it's the textures....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

cl_forcepreload "1"            		// [0,1] Forces the game to load all texture and model information into memory on map load.
cl_phys_props_max "300" 		// [300] Sets the range that props show up.
cl_ragdoll_collide "1"       		// [0,1] If set to 1, prevents characters from merging into each other due to ragdoll effects, thereby improving realism with no real performance hit.
cl_show_splashes "1"         		// [0,1] If set to 1, splashes in water are shown, if set to 0 they are disabled. Can improve performance if disabled at the cost of realism.
fps_max "86"                 		// [fps] Limits the maximum possible framerate to the FPS specified. Has no impact on framerate performance (other than capping it). This is best set to your monitor's refresh rate for smoother FPS, due to less volatile fluctuations. Setting it higher does not increase overall FPS.
gl_clear "0"            		// [0,1] Toggles visual quality - cracks between textures show when set to 1.
jpeg_quality "100"           		// [percentage] - Specifies the default quality percentage for screenshots taken with the jpeg command.
lod_Enable "1"               		// [0,1] If set to 1, allows the level of detail (lod) of objects to be gradually reduced the further they are from the player. This should be set to 1 for optimal performance, or 0 for maximum image quality.
mat_antialias "0"			// [2,4,6,8] Sets level of anti-aliasing.
mat_bumpmap "1"              		// [0,1] If set to 1, enables bump mapping which makes flat 2D textures appear three dimensional. If disabled, textures will be loaded without bumpmapping and will appear far less realistic, however performance will be improved.
mat_clipz "1"                		// [0,1] If set to 1, uses an optimization technique to reduce what is drawn on screen for a performance improvement. Note that some Nvidia FX card owners need to set mat_clipz 0 to fix rendering problems.
mat_colorcorrection "1"			// [0,1] Enable or disable color correction.
mat_compressedtextures "0" 	 	// [0,1] If set to 1, uses compressed textures for optimal performance. For those with graphics cards which have higher amounts of Video RAM (e.g. 256MB) setting this to 0 will improve texture appearance at the cost of some performance.
mat_dxlevel "95"			// [90/81/80/70] DirectX Level. 
mat_fastnobump "0"           		// [0,1] If set to 1, floor textures have all bump mapping removed and will appear flat and smooth. This can improve performance without affecting all bump mapping in the game, but will make floors appear unrealistic.
mat_filterlightmaps "1"      		// [0,1] If set to 1, static lightmaps are rendered correctly. If set to 0, all areas of pre-rendered lighting will be blocky and unrealistic, but performance will be improved slightly at the cost of realism.  
mat_forceaniso "8"			// [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16] Sets Anistropic Filtering Level.
mat_forcemanagedtextureintohardware "0" // [0,1] If set to 1, attempts to force texture information into your Video RAM at the start of a level, alleviating any stuttering in the game. Note, this setting was introduced with the stutter fix patch. Also note that from feedback and in my experience this setting can reduce FPS by up to 50%. Setting this variable to 0 may improve performance on some machines.
mat_hdr_enabled "1"			// [0,1] Enables, disables HDR.
mat_hdr_level "2"			// [0,1,2] Set to 0 for no HDR, 1 for LDR and bloom on HDR maps, and 2 for full HDR and bloom on HDR maps.

mat_non_hdr_bloom_scalefactor "0.25"	// [x] Scale factor for HDR Bloom effect. 
mat_picmip "0"				// [0-High, 1-Medium, 2-Low] Sets texture quality. Is the same as the Texture Detail menu.
mat_specular "1"             		// [0,1] If set to 1, uses specular lighting. If set to 0 materials will not have specular lighting applied to them for a performance boost but a slight drop in image quality.
mat_trilinear "1"   			// [0,1] Disables and sets bilinear / Enable trilinear filtering.
mat_vsync "1"				// [0,1] Enables Vertical Sync.
mp_decals "300"				// [300/4096] This determines the maximum number of decals visible at one time.
muzzleflash_light "1"        		// [0,1] If set to 1, weapons firing will emit a light along with the muzzle flash. If set to 0, a muzzle flash is still visible but no lighting is cast from it. Performance will improve in combat scenes with no noticeable drop in realism.
props_break_max_pieces "-1"		// [0,1] Disables prop fragmenting.
r_3dsky "1"            			// [0,1] Disables the rendering of 3d sky boxes.

r_decal_cullsize "5"			// [0-15] The distance from which bulletholes are visible. Higher numbers mean a shorter viewing.  Decals don't just appear when you get close, it makes it so you can see them from any distance.
r_drawbatchdecals "1"        		// [0,1] Enables the rendering of decals in batch.
r_drawflecks "1"             		// [0,1] If set to 1, small chunks of rubble and dirt will be thrown up around bullet impact points. If set to 0, these flecks will be disabled, reducing realism but improving performance.
r_drawmodeldecals "1"			// [0,1] If set to 1, decals can be drawn on models, which are pretty much everything excluding walls and floors. If set to 0 these decals will be disabled, improving performance during weapons fire for example, but reducing realism.
r_dynamic "1"                		// [0,1] If set to 1, enables dynamic lighting. If set to 0, disables dynamic lighting which can boost performance without a dramatic impact on realism.

If set to -1 detects your default hardware setting for this option. Initially this should be set to 1, and if you see any problems then set to -1.
r_lightaverage "1"			// [0,1] Activates/deactivate light averaging
r_lod "-1"				// [-1] Set the model lod (only values -1,0,1,2 legal in cal...-1 = Variable at distance. 0 = None. 1 = Minor. 2 = Less minor).

-----------EDIT------------<br>
<br>
I fixed it! Holy crap did I ever!  I get like 220 FPS with 8 x MSAA and 8 x AF.<br>
<br>
Special thanks to Seagull, I had no idea about that timedemo stuff, really helped and Keefy, you got me on track to muck around with my cvars, thanks.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what I did was I reverted the graphics cvars by typing 'differences' in the console to find figure out which ones might have been causing problems.  This is what I changed:<br>
<br>
cl_forcepreload "0"<br>
mat_compressedtextures "1"<br>
mat_forcemanagedtextureintohardware "1"<br>
mat_trilinear "0"<br>
mat_vsync "1"<br>
<br>
*note if you use a really high resolution ingame, setting mat_forcemanagedtextureintohardware "1" will help your FPS.<br>
<br>
Now I can use the Models and textures, no prob!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The point is that you bought L4D.  They made more money out of you from that then they would get from a new DM.  Very few people now will pay $50 for a deathmatch game.  Just look at how well UT3 did and that was a highly anticipated game. <br>
<br>
I got the game packaged with HL2.  It was an addon bonus game to make people feel that they were getting 2 games for the price of one.  They dd the same with css iirc.  Css took off, sadly DM did not have the same popularity so whe it came time to invest in one they chose CSS as the better bet because more people played that.  I do hope they port DM to OB and package it with EP3.  Hopefully it will see a resurgance from that but considering the current trend in gaming away from deathmatch to more pure coop style play, it may not be much.  I hope that isn't  the case of course.   I still find DM to be the best online game I have found so far.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

im just saying... it would bother me as a developer (if i was one) that i made a broken game. i mean i dont know if you guys play other games but i do and i know from experience that games dont crash. we are so used to this being hl2dm players that we fail to realize how big of a problem this is.  like i said it wouldnt take a lot of time to fix hl2dm... there are bugs that come from the engine and since valve is planning to port the game over to a diff engine it would be a waste of time to fix those bugs. but there are other bugs, the game is simply flawed due to the lack of attention from the developers and i think valve should fix these bugs, simply out of common decency.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I understand your point, but HL2DM is not a money maker.  Valve is in buisness to make money.  It is not smart buisness practice to pay someones salary on something that will not make money.  They will put their people's time and their salary (money) on things that are worth their while.  That is how you stay in buisness.  If someone has spare time they do sometimes fix things, but as most of us know, in the gaming industry there very little spare time for coders and programmers with all the bugs they have to fix in their popular games plus code their next big project.  You even said L4D has issues so that has to take priority.  They are not going to dedicate someone permanently for a month to take care of a game that has 3000 people playing it over one that has 13000 people playing it.  Even though we might think it should bother them, their biggest concern is what is going to keep them in buisness.  Sometimes developers scrap whole games and move on because the realize its no longer worth the effort and its not going to make money.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My l4d game runs like a raped whore compared to dm.   7 outta 10 times I crash on map changes, 7 outta 10 times I crash when changing rates on a 7 outta 10 servers.  I think this game gets  7 outta 10.  <br>
<br>
L4D gets a 10, because I dont crash, because my video is maxed and I still get major FPS and because there's no bullshit whole map length shotgun headshots with no spread.<br>
<br>
and from the people I've played with, seen on pub servers in l4d, generic random people who bitch about the game stuttering and crashing, I tell them one thing.  <br>
<br>
"Look at your advanced video settings"......reply "uh...how do I do that...."   <br>
<br>
once they finally find it, omg....triple buffer vertical sync is on....wtf.....OMG they turned it off.....uber smoothness!!!  no more crashing.  it's a miracle.  <br>
<br>
it's usually client side issues or people renting shit servers for the game...and yes, there are a lot of shit servers running l4d and it sucks ballz.  wouldn't it be epic if steam set a standard for servers it will list in browser?<br>
<br>
ah yes, I believe there was an issue with the 180.XX driver from nvidia as well... which a lot of people reverted back to 178.xx and it was all good.  If you noticed, it took a month and they threw out 181.xx, because the 180.xx was junk.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Did you try running the game in windowed mode, then hit fullscreen?<br>
That worked like a charm for me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">here are the drivers ive tried so far:<br>
<br>
178.13 whql<br>
178.24 whql<br>
180.48 whql<br>
180.60 beta <br>
180.70 beta<br>
181.20 whql<br>
181.22 whql<br>
<br>
the lock ups are really interesting btw. if you check the console after a lock up happened what you see is that you paused and unpaused the game... a lot. i dont get lock ups with 170 series drivers, but they dont fix the crashes and the bluescreens. with 180 series drivers i get lock ups unless i run the game in windowed mode without borders. the only thing that works to make the crashes and bluscreens go away is turning off dual core rendering. while it was comfortable to play through an entire campaign without a single problem, my fps was so low that it ruined my game experience. im very disappointed tbh, especially knowing that the game worked fine with the 180.70 driver before i upgraded to a new one. now rolling back to it doesnt help.<br>

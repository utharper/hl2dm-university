	<div class="content">I played this map a couple of years ago. But I don't know it's name.<br>
<br>
It was a Half-Life 2 Deathmatch map. Probably a co-op one. Everyone was fighting a giant green robot. The kind you see in Japanese anime' or movies. The thing would shoot missiles from its hands, and would come apart and bring out bigger weapons as its body was destroyed by your attacks. It was awesome!<br>
<br>
There's a video of it on GameTrailers.com, but unfortunately you can only see it throwing cars around, and one of its arms. So I haven't included the video. <br>
<br>
Could anyone here please help me find this map???? I ask because you are part of a greater online community of several clans so I figure SOMEONE has to know about this.<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from you soon!<br>

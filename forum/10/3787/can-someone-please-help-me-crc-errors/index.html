	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">CRC means cyclical redundancy check which means the archive containing the map file is corrupted and is most likely due to a problem with your archive program or internet connection. The fact that is happens both in game and out of game would seem to suggest that its your connection. Does your connection sometimes time out or get large lag spikes?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You're the one who created an alias account in a dead game just to say how bad i was in a game after losing to flas in a tourny. You went through all that trouble to create an alias account to say i was bad in a game, or someone in ewr did, and by the looks of you being that pissed off, im pretty sure it was you.  So im just getting my revenge..how does it feel?  yeah yeah you can go on about how you don't play the game anymore, but aren't you in ewr? aren't you guys like supposed to be the best and never lose? im just trolling you back.  Oh, and im finding it very hard to believe it's not you..or someone in ewr since he's on your friends so you probably know who he is. And the whole, "everyone loves me" thing..that's extremely unlikely. This is pretty lame, but when someone randomly adds you aliasing just to tell you how bad you are, im pretty sure that would piss you off too.  This is the part when everyone in ewr starts trolling.<br>
Oh and nutri, for someone who goes through as much trouble as you do to troll people and pretty much your main mission is to do that, you'd think you would actually be better at it.  I mean, having the dude on your friends list, and then saying that you don't know who he is that he just added you because he loves you, that's pretty much giving it away, i expected more of you.  And thanks for posting this, now everyone can really see how much of a tool you are.  I may have gone through the trouble to confront you, but atleast i didn't go through the trouble to create another account just to fuck with people in a dead game.  It's different when you're in a server with people scrimming (mostly blas, val, etc) and we call people baddies we're all fucking around (it's a love-hate relationship  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> ), but when you do it the way you did it, it's like seriously?  Im not going to reply to this pointless topic because thats just going to egg (w/e the word is for it) you on even more and the rest of ewr. <br>
By the way, im not as bad as a person nutri's making me out to be, I hope you don't fall for his bullshit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Typing like three words about me writing a paragraph.  Nutri just posted a whole convo and you didn't have anything to say about that?

That doesn't really make any sense seeing how it was Ghost that made the post, not nutri.  Ghost would still have to read the entire convo to see whats going on.  I'm just waiting for PB to say something retarded and random, like master of the universe 08 or some shit, that never gets old..that's if he ever decides to get off starcraft.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He has atleast one alias account...it doean't even matter, because everyone in ewr does.  I remember pubbing in a server and just seeing a bunch of random dudes come on and they were all asking for a scrim..i forgot the names but it was pretty obvious.<br>

Just to comment on this.<br>
<br>
It does not make the skill ceiling lower it just changes the way one has to play the game. One has to adjust to a modded shotgun in AG2, its funny how no one complained about the shotgun before the orangebox update yet it was always the same. If you want to bitch, bitch about the movement, not the shotgun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

before ob update this game still had movement that allowed you to gain distance between shotty rushing retards or even get away from them because most of them are downsyndrome idiots and have garbage movement but that isnt the case anymore<br>
<br>
as for ag2 shotgun you actually had to you know AIM it hence why all the bads didnt play during efps 2v2, not because they think mods suck but the fact that they cant one shot you from across the map<br>

	<div class="content">Spent 30 or so seconds on topic. Here's my ignorant post on the matter:<br>
<br>
Silly to get riled up over a dead game. Even sillier to make a huge, expansive and rage post in response (you're essentially letting them win). Especially with no structuring or paragraphs. tl;dr indeed.<br>
<br>
HL2CTF already has an innate "DM" mode, I believe. However, you'll need to add in SMGs to each map. But the new Lost Village for it is already released.<br>
<br>
Before people cry about CTF's hitreg, remember, you guys lived with it before the OB update. Improved movement, better balanced weapons, and innate hitsound is a good tradeoff, no?<br>
<br>
Sacri, if you're going to make weapon damage changes in 2.1 though, you really should gather the opinions of more players or at least prod the community and see their responses.<br>
<br>
And I still resent that the RPG is really easy to acquire in certain maps when orbs/smg nades/underused OICW nades might've sufficed. CTF isn't really big either, so I don't think it's good to argue that, "well these maps are intended for large scale play." I think Dirtwork and 2fort deals with RPG the best for 4v4+ while Elite and Storm deal with it the worst (Storm is basically camp mid -&gt; gain enormous advantage and likely kill flag carrier -&gt; camp mid again for RPG spawn, not very much depth). Some other maps like Canals deal with the RPG problem interestingly too. I'm on the edge with that. I think it's very, very silly for Epicenter (I was wrecking that 8v8 pub solely due to Shield + infinite RPG rawkets, SKILLS BRAH).<br>
<br>
CTF has some decent 1v1 flag maps... Canyon1 is all about magnum, until the RPG drops at 5 mins. Canyon2 is about smg nades and controlling that mid mag, lol, and using Shield/dropping it at the right time. Pretty fun map. None of them really involve too much tactics like DM maps though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I'll make the TL;DR version since most you prefer that way.<br>
<br>
Vaps won not because he's a mindless zombie but because he was able to master a skill you guys couldn't..remember PB used the same strategy...ppl called it bullshit...i called it skill. Remember if anyone could do it then you all would be doing it. <br>
<br>
Blasphemy regarded as one of the best players in hl2dm which i can agree with is known for being the best orber in the game. No one attacks him because they have FINALLY  accepted that spam  after all the turmoil that it had with first few years at the game is acceptable. Now that shotty is the NEW strat (since PB) , people can't accept it because there old strats are getting outplayed.<br>
<br>
The finals will be Blasphemy (orbs/nades) vs Vaporizer (Shotgun). Both the best at what they do.....Be interesting at the outcome. This "IS" hl2dm. The battle of strats that some may regard as CHEAP. Accept it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

is dm mode out yet?</div></blockquote>
dm mode has been out since we released. Just need maps <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">. Porting dm maps is pretty simple really. Add smg, OICW, railgun, sniper, and pistol weapon spawns. Add their respective ammo. Add large batteries and runes if you want to. Make sure there is an info_player_start and ctf_camera. Add a ctf_game_settings_entity and turn on deathmatch in it's properties and compile the thing. I will start porting over a bunch if none are moved over here soon. I can do all that stuff I just posted with an entity editor without using hammer at all.  So Im not really stepping on the map author's toes to much. I'd prefer it if they ported their own stuff over though <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think most of you guys are too quick to write vapor off as just some shotty whoring noob. You forget he has excellent mag/xbow as well, and he's very fast. He's definitely a top player. I think bAhLK! is just as good, but not as consistent. Perhaps next time they face each other bAhLK! will win.<br>
<br>
     If you remember the CAL 1v1 finals of PoorBilly vs Confused, it was pretty much pure shotgun out of both of them, along with spam. The shotgun works magic for some players, and that isn't just luck, its skill... (and yes its very annoying, but whatever)<br>
<br>
     As far as who's the best these days, im pretty sure the two best players didn't even sign up for the 1v1 tournament. (Edge/Phantom) Blas vs. Cheese will be a great match to see! Hoping for a 911 vs 911 finals (yes im totally biased) but Blas is really a strong player and Cheese will have to pull something out of his hat.<br>

P.S. PoorBilly, you still playing sc2? Im down for a game<br>

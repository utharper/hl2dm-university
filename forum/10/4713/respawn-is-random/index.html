	<div class="content">i would like to know if the spawnpoints for rebels and combines are the same or if there are specific spawnpoints for rebs and for combine. a freind told me that f.e. in lockdown the combines mostly spawn in shower area and the rebels mostly in the main part of the map. i didnt expereinced this so i wonder if anyone knows the "truth" about that.<br>
i know that in some maps like runoff the spawnpoints are fixed for rebs and combine, but how is it for octa, ld, bio or other maps?<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">boshed has explained everything : combine respawns and rebel ones for maps like runoff, else it's mixed.<br>
<br>
One day I have taken a screenshot of lostv from the sky, printed it and then I have bind /kill to a key and I have written where I was respowning on the printed paper. I have done that dozens and dozens of times in a row to see if there were some strange stuff in the way I respawn. But no I promess you it looks very random. No cycle, etc...<br>
<br>
Btw in other games like Quake Live there are 2 systems : the respawns are random but the algorithm try its best to make you respawn far away from your opponent to avoid you to be killed at respawn. In big maps its really a good thing when in small maps you can in a way control where you want your ennemy to appears by moving to a special location to make your opponent appears in another specific location you want. But when I see the number of respawn kills in HL2 I dont think there is such a system <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So this got me interested and you're not the first person to mention this, think I saw somebody talking about it on interlopers. Science hat on <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
I made a test box with 4 spawns numbered in the order I added them then went in and killed myself a few times. Results were:<br>
<br>
1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 4, 4, 2<br>
<br>
Was interesting that I started at spawn 1 so reloaded the map and tried again:<br>
<br>
3, 2, 2, 4, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2<br>
<br>
The weighting towards spawn 3 is most likely my small sample size. What would be fun to see is getting two people in it and placing one person near one of the spawns then repeatedly killing the other and seeing if their spawn is weighted towards the spawn they are near. Teamplay vs ffa results would be good to look at too as well as a full 4 players<br>
<br>
I think it's a simple case of our natural tendancy to try to find patterns in randomness which any statistician can tell you all about. <br>

	<div class="content">Well nothing is really random with computers. I do not have time to mess around with it right now but in my previous mapping and coding experience there are some non random attributes associated with spawns. Any of these items may or may not be true, but at one time in either HLDM or HL2DM they were true as far as I know. <br>
<br>
You used to be able to add a #1, #2 and so on to the name field I think in a map and force the game to spawn people in the order they were numbered. <br>
<br>
If you boot up a map and play it you will usually start spawning in the same spot, if you completely shut the game down and start it up again it will happen again. The spawns are probably random based on server time not the computer time. So the first spawn may always be at time = 0 and there fore not really be random. <br>
<br>
The spawn code has looked for things in the past to avoid. Usually a player to try to avoid telefragging. In HL2DM I believe it also looked for physics objects so by piling up objects on a spawn you may be able to manipulate where people spawn. <br>
<br>
Respawning at ladder does happen and is a bug, if you die on a ladder you will usually respawn right there again. <br>
<br>
The best thing to do if you really care would be to go look at the code and just read what it does. I highly doubt that the code is 100% random but there is not suppose to be a real bias such as spawn close or spawn far as in some other games.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Must say I've never heard of this in all my time mapping for HLDM or HL2DM. (Its highly possible though, Valve do like to hide stuff well) It would be pretty cool for specific goal based maps  like jump / training / objective though.<br>

I'm not getting this at all on my test map, totally random starts - haven't tried this on other maps yet though.<br>

Now this is a <em class="text-italics">really</em> good point! If lots of spawns commonly become blocked with props then the pool of available spawns would be smaller leading to the weighting noticed by players. Would explain a lot.<br>

Best suggestion tbh. I have an huge interest in this kind of stuff because 1) I'm a mapper and 2) I work on a mod. The more you know about your tools the better you can use them and all that stuff. <br>
<br>
I'll have a word with our coder when he gets back and let you know anything interesting that comes from it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Two maps I know that do this are ctf_warpath_b4b and ctf_avanti_b2c. Both are cp maps, actualy. And as you advance/retreat you spawn accordingly to the position of the highest point your team as captured so far.<br>

All I know is that info_player_deathmatch has no options available. It's a "click and it's ready" entity.<br>

	<div class="content">ok, for the past 3 weeks or so ive noticed that steam is very sluggish when loading and exiting.  i chalked it up to my at&amp;t tyrants cutting my dsl service back to the lowest tier offered.  but i dont think thats the case.<br>
<br>
im not noticing terrible choke/loss/lag issues while playing.  crashes are about the same as before.  so im not sure dsl speed has anything to do with it.<br>
<br>
anyway, when i start steam it takes 20-30 seconds to load.  each time im like... fuck, this is the time it wont load.  the only weirdness ingame involves alt-tabbing to desktop.  when i do this lately, i cant do anything to bring the game back up.  i click on the taskbar tab to bring it up and get a warning beep.  right clicking does nothing (no menu popup).  once in awhile, if i wait 2 or 3 minutes, i can click the tab and pull the game back up... but again, it loads very slow.  i usually have to go to task manager and kill it... resulting in the microsoft error reporting box.  now, every single time i quti the game and exit steam... i get one of 2 things:  the microsoft error reporting box or a steam popup box stating that only one instance of hl2dm can be run at one time (something like that, i cant remember the actual wording at the moment).  when i get the steam popup box, it takes me several tries over 3 or 4 minutes before it either exits as it should or gives me the microsoft error reporting box.<br>
<br>
it seems to me like steam is running something in the background.  but i'll be damned if i know what or how to stop it.  any ideas?  i only have hl2, hl2dm, hl2dmpro, and hl2dmOB games.  i dont think its any of those updating in the background.<br>
<br>
suggestions?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is a huge shot in the dark...but when is the last time you checked for spyware and cleaned it out?<br>
<br>
Have you tried verifying the cache and defragmenting local files through steam, not the windows defragger?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i thought of that too.  i  run a spyware and virus scan at least 2 times a week.  also a registry/file cleaner daily.  since this issue startd, ive verified integrity several times.  also the defrag local files (although it has ALWAYS been 0% fragmented) several times.  i even defragged the hard-drives.  lol<br>
<br>
i dont notice this with my browser, just steam.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well, i think ive narrowed it down to the hl2.exe.  thats what the microsoft error box points to as the problem.<br>

	<div class="content">I have this issue with Orange Box games, you <span style="text-decoration:underline">can't</span> change your ingame name. That being said, either you change your identity, so called steam name (that what makes ppl recognize you) or you just play with the same old name forever, otherwise friends will stop knowing who you are.<br>
<br>
If hl2dm didn't have a name box the <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3194" class="postlink"><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">aliases</span></strong></a> thread from The Argumentalizer wouldn't exist. So this is also another fun thing about this game.<br>
<br>
Other than that you can have a clan in a game and that clan doesn't exist in the other game, so you have another clan there and thus you need to change name or at least the tag, everytime you go from one game to the other.<br>
<br>
Personally I hate that in OB games.<br>
Now tell me what are your opinions on this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Changing the steam name is easy, I know. But that's exactly what I think it doesn't make sense, kyle. I told this in steam forum aswell, I have dozens of friends that I don't know who they are anymore cuz they swap name everyday or every hour. Each time someone talks to me I gotta see the aliases list to "possibly" get to know who they are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yeah, this is exactly the problem. Many of players here have more than 10-20 "friends" in the friend list, and when all users swapping the name because of playing L4D in Clan XYZ and hours later TF2 in Clan ABC.<br>
<br>
Then you got a chat window and you are total confused, because you didn't know who he is.<br>
<br>
In official steam forum all peoples say "easy man, change you name easy in overlay" ... lol ... they did not get the real problem, or did not play many different games<br>
<br>
i take a look to the HL2DM OB and it seems like appreciate replacement. I try not all tricks and bugs, but the most are worked very well, but this based on OB, so you can not setup a name without changing steam community name<br>
<br>
Sometimes we made funny stuff in game with names, not necessary - but fun. And this is why i heat this very old problem up again, because next days will more games follow the OB concept ...<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Well i post these on steam forum this made it clear what exactly the point is<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>yeah right "it takes just 10 seconds to change the name"<br>
<br>
yeah i total agree with that<br>
<br>
but please think one step forward<br>
<br>
do not think about what this effect to you, this is not the point<br>
<br>
the point is : think about all your friends<br>
<br>
if you have 100 or 150 friends, you will finally lost all focus about who is who if anybody change the steam community name depend on what game he play<br>
<br>
this is the point<br>
<br>
the community was build to connecting peoples they wanna play games. yes right, agree<br>
<br>
but on the other side, nobody can tell me he KNOWS all his friends in his list ... nobody do this, maybe 4 or 10 maximal are really know<br>
<br>
the rest just funny players meet sometimes or often is some games<br>
<br>
if these "half" friends switching the steam community name and maybe the avatar, you get lost, you will never know who was who in this mine field<br>
<br>
than you get a big problem in this kind of community, you have 100 friends in your list but you did not longer know who was who<br>
<br>
a community made for a community - a game for game - so both names should be splitted, else you get a community for just one game or a game for this community<br>
<br>
i open this thread in November 2008 where i see already this problem and now this problem is a real big problem<br>
<br>
i have already players in my friend list there are "unknown" for me after some time. They change the name because playing TF2 and L4D. And they change the names between the games, because today Clan X tomorrow Clan Y what ever<br>
<br>
And no ... my just accept invited from peoples with i play for more than 5 games. i total ignore one game stand invites, because friend list has limited count of friends, i need these slots for our league<br>
<br>
Anyway, the problem is not the task "change name is simple" - yeah it is, the problem is the community will get broken<br>
<br>
and this can only be solved when OB set as default the steam community name (like unnamed) but you can all the time override this name in game without changing community name and it will be saved than. Like css or hl2dm and other none OB games</div></blockquote>

Yea I tried that mod some time ago and... omg... never seen anything so bad. The idea isn't at all bad, but the gameplay was OMFGWTFFFJEEEZZ!!!!!!111<br>
<br>
I don't know if I played the OB version of it or not, but still..., REALLY, not being able to jump while you strafe?????<br>
...I can't remember anything else right now, but... omfg...<br>

I'll download this mod again and review it again, just out of my own curiosity. Was the worst modded good idea I've ever seen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I didn't know it till then (today actually)<br>

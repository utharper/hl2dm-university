LOL&lt; im pretty sure you're joking, if you're not then......something's wrong. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">  Tool is WAY more than just insanely good music.  They are brilliant guys, and they bring that intelligence to their music and videos.  Justin Chancellor is far and away my favorite bassist, prolly of all time.  They may be players just as good, but coupled with the sound and message Tool presents JC wins.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Um, you obviously didnt listen to the whole song or any of their other songs. And no chem, Im certainly not joking. Tool is a really good band, but they dont hold a candle to Opeth. Maynard isnt half the singer that Aukerfeldt is. Dont get me wrong here, Im a tool fan, but they are miles behind the musical genius of Opeth. The truth is, neither one is the most talented band of all time lol, to me, that goes to Rush.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i just went back and listened to more of their songs. i will admit they are better then i originally gave them credit for.  BUT....to say that TOOL cant hold a candle to THEM, is so rediculas that i feel we cant continue this conversation.  i actually agree with 95% of the things you say on here Sac.  and i like you a lot, but on this one......agree to disagree, because if you think that band is even in the same ball park as Tool then we will never get any where.  but, to each his own.  no worries bro</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

having said that I'm with trompe really. I saw them at lollapalooza 94 on the side stage back when I was into metal, they were impressive for sure.

Wow, I thought you were already a fan of Opeth. You need to listen to all their albums before making a decision then. Ive heard all of Tool's stuff and all of Opeth's stuff. Until you have listened to all of their stuff, I'll agree to disagree <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> Just so you know, I rate both bands above most others. They are both very unique and amazingly talented. I just personally prefer Opeth. Nothing against you preferring Tool.<br>
<br>
As for best vocalist, I'd say Patton is top 5 easily. It's really hard to chose between him, Dickinson, Coverdale, Tate, Staley.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Excuse me but your post said i might be wondering who the most talented band ever was, as if it were a statement of fact.<br>
If you had said you love Tool (not literally) and yadda yadda, i would HAVE to agree. I have ALL the TOOL albums and have liked them long time.<br>
BUT, they are not the most talented band and in fact, seem to have run out of ideas. Every song (if you can call it that) sounds the same.<br>

Yeah I didn't want to review every album. Tool has some great songs. The best songs have more to do with the flying sound that the guitarist, drummer, and bassist make. To me, the singer brings some of the music down. Like when he makes every hard drum beat = a syllable (like a spondee). It makes for a manic sound, but then nothing can be emphasised because it's ALL emphasised. The singers I like tend not to be so constrained by the music, but will sing an unstressed syllable on a low beat (bass drum maybe) and stresses on the high beat (like a snare). Sometimes they skip a couple beats to work above the music say with long vowel sounds or to switch between iambs and trochees (duh-DUM ....  DUM -duh). Think like Robert Plant for long vowels. Jim and many others are good for trochee/iambs.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many times here the vocals emphasises the music and the music emphasises the voicals.<br>

The girl lives an hour or so away from us so we don't get to see her often, but next time we see her or I just get tired of waiting and I have my gf call her or IM her, I'll see whats up. The only thing I would ask is to cover shipping, but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be that much for a CD anyways...</div></blockquote>

<br>
ya, thats what i meant.  if you could just ship it, couldnt be more than $5 or so.  i will reimburse you with a $50 steam game to cover the shipping, your time and effort, and your genorasity.  i think that would be easier then me mailing you a check or w/e.  if that's K with you we can do it that way.  if not, i will do w/e works best for you bro.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

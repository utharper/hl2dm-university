Edit:  Valve should really try to promote this.  There's tons of people out there that don't know the full HL storyline.  Making the original more up to date would possible get more people interested in the story of HL and further their sales of upcoming episodes or sequels.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hello Friends.<br>
<br>
We have just suffered from a brutal hard drive failure, which led us to a fresh install of our forums. At this time we are still trying to recover our website but I regret to inform you that it appears all data has been lost. We are breaking night and day, drinking stockpiles of Redbull to get the lights on (website that is!). Please bear with us. This is a tough time for all.<br>
<br>
Development of the mod has NOT been affected by this at all, simply only our website. While the forums are lost, We are still on track for our release this year.<br>
<br>
Once again thank you all for your ongoing support, we love you.</div></blockquote>

This + " It's coming out next months guys" (long time ago) is what raised all the questionning.<br>
<br>
If, say 3 months ago, the mod was going to be released "next month"<br>
<br>
and then <br>

With that being said I only see Obama winning in 2012. Ron Paul will not be able to influence enough people for real change. Rick Perry with that debate mess-up  and Herman Cain with the sexual abuse will turn off many. Mitt Romney that polygamy piece of shit doesn't have a chance and everyone else are one in the same.<br>
<br>
There isn't a doubt in my mind you Americans will continue in believing in the system and looking up to Obama to change it. Maybe not all of you here, but the majority will vote for Obama once again for 2012.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

who controlled both the house and senate in 2010?  democrats.  why no budget?  cant blame the republicans for that now, can we?<br>

here in 2011 it MUST be the republicans fault, right?  they control the house now!  damn those republicans.  OOPS.  the house DID pass a budget.  the senate, still in control of the democrats, rejected the house budget bill.  and offered up their own senate version for debate?  NOPE.  notta.  bubkis.<br>
<br>
how bout the O's budget?  the democratic controlled house AND senate not approve of the "ONES" very own budget in 2010?  the democrat controlled senate not approve of the "ONES" 2011 budget?<br>

I hope you're joking about Gingrich..... If you're serious....a reality check may be imminent.   The political stage is all a big script. All these candidates are nothing but a sideshow. Obama is the favorite of the elite because he has the power of influence. Obama doesn't go against the grain so why replace him??<br>

The President has a very large effect on the economy in my opinion. It's not an effect you can really track though. It's about perception and attitude. People need to feel like they are being treated properly and that everything is going to be ok for them. It's what a leader does imo. Some have it, some dont. The last 2 did not have it. None of the current GOP noms have it either. We are fucked either way. Last 2 to have the "IT" factor, was Clinton and Reagan. Regardless of their politics, people backed them because they made people feel good about themselves.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think a few folks around here have been following politics for maybe 900 days or so.<br>
<br>
Frankly, Gingrich may be exactly the guy we need in the WH.<br>
Combative, able to gather folks in his party and get stuff done, like repealing everything Obama pooted on the country.<br>
<br>
Hope and Change is over. We are not going to become fucking GREECE.<br>
The Left is a massive failure. From the push into Subprime Fannie and Freddie, to not passing a BUDGET in 3 years, to disregard for the Federal Laws to fix Medicare, to massive deficits, it's time for a real change, like:<br>
<br>
Tax Reform<br>
Spending and department cuts<br>
Fixing Social Security<br>
Cutting away layers of redundant nonsense gubbmint.<br>
<br>
Newt is, unlike Obama, smart and versed in History. He knows how DC works.<br>
Nobody is hot for Romney and Obama is a lame duck.<br>
<br>
Obama, the nobody from nowhere Community agitator was part of the greatest most successful Madison Ave. Advertising campaign in History. Folks bought into Hope and Change. They had Bush fatigue. They wanted a fresh face and McCain was a horrible candidate. That is now history.<br>
<br>
Truth is, Obama is not a leader of anything. Porkulus, Policy...was all delegated to Pelosi and Reid. Obama doesn't talk to anybody, not even our allies! It is documented he has no relationships with Congress. He is a horrible Prez, far worse than Bush.<br>
At least the wheels weren't falling off the cart during his term.<br>
<br>
3 fricking years of 14 million out of work! 5 TRILLION in debt in 3 years!!<br>
Why would anyone vote for Obama?<br>
<br>
Honestly, if you think Gingrich is unelectable, i have one word for you: NIXON.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Why is it mysterious, you do realize you're living in a country with one of the worlds only minority governments with a broadly unpopular leader and party. How much corruption does it take for a Canuck to reach breaking point?<br>

Newt isn't have as absurd as some junior visiting law professor/community agitator with no record at all, no experience at all at anything, named BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA, peddling Hopey Changey New Tones in DC and other snake oil.<br>
<br>
Whose first acts as President was to send back the bust of the spectacular Winston Churchill, a GIFT from Great Britain and then having BEBE to the WH and not even having dinner with him.<br>
<br>
Then he went on to sandbag him with talk of having to negotiate from 60s borders.<br>
Then pissed off the British PM and gave the Queen an Ipod loaded with his stupid speeches.<br>
<br>
Navy CORPSEMAN! What an idiot.<br>
Gingrich will rip him in any debate.<br>

lol what a joke<br>

The best governing system "by citizens" in relation to direct vote is a true democracy. We have a republic where direct vote is diluted by various systemic measures (electoral college, the senate, individual rights are less important and executive orders primarily).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What the fuck dude, do you not know anything about newt, it is a known fact that he is corrupt, theres no doubt in anyones mind about that. Its well documented, and if u havent heard the facts allready u must have ur head up ur ass, even in Ron Pauls attack on Newt, which i posted, some of these things are revisited. And they literally barely even touched on his corruption and hypocracy.<br>

<br>
<br>
   Fact is....The majority of the people are <strong class="text-strong">NOT</strong> corrupt. You're correct with that comment, BUT The higher you go up the ladder the more corruption you will see. If you are telling me that the people at the top of the government, federal agencies, and corperations are not corrupt....... then we have a problem.  <br>
<br>
"Maybe nobody told you this but America is governed by it citizens, not Kings or dictators or thugs or criminals."   <br>

 America is absolutely, positively ran by thugs and criminals. <br>

	<div class="content">You know the fucked thing about you impala. You tell me i got a broken psyche for having my so called beliefs. Yet you follow religion which requires belief.  The thing that seperates me from you is that  there is proof out there that can be seen in plain sight. You have nothing in your religion that can be proven. All i gotta do is pull up the documents. <br>
<br>
Heres a quick example: Enron.<br>
<br>
 Proof of ties with government and big banks. all inside illegal shit.    I only use this as an example because enron is a great starting point for anyone wanting to know whats really going on.         Documentary : Enron: Smartest guys in the room.    Watch it.<br>
<br>
example 2: JP Morgan            <br>
<br>
    While most Americans are struggling hard to overcome the hardships of the recession, the profits of national banks continue to rise. JP Morgan is among those cashing-in ... and it's a contract to process food stamp payments that's helping it on its way. The Rich benefit off the back of the poor.<br>
<br>
 They profit off of others misfortunes. Not too mention all the other illegal shit they do behind closed doors.<br>

Those are just 2. You give me a topic and i'll show you the corruption.<br>

Also, Gingrich did exactly that as Speaker. Maybe you are too young to remember. He shook up the orthodoxy, spoke directly to the people via the Contract and voted on every single measure they promised.<br>
He dragged Clinton into Welfare reform, passed fixes for entitlements, passed balanced budgets...<br>
<br>
I am not distraught over the possibility Romney will win. I will vote for him.<br>
Ron Paul hasn't won a single primary and won't.<br>
I respect many of his views and admire that he is pushing his agenda but people don't elect midget warlocks as President.<br>

Fact is, any of the GOP runners is far better than the disaster/complete failure imposter now in the WH.<br>
Even Michelle Bachmann is preferable, although dropped out.<br>

Obama is a one term experiment gone bad. The Hope and Changiacs will not be motivated this time out. Obama is not fresh and full of fresh bobblehead Teleprompter bullshit and propaganda you can believe in. This election is a GOP swing season far in favor of the GOP in the House, Senate and WH.<br>

It's a huge deal. Debt at more than a 100% yearly GDP is ridiculous.<br>
America now has a President and Gubbmint that isn't that different in reality than Mussolini and his Fascist regime.<br>
The only saving us us is the fact the Dollar is the International currency of choice. A safe harbor.<br>
If anything happens negatively on that front, we will be paying a Trillion a year in Interest.<br>
More than the military budget and any single program.<br>
<br>
The situation is dire but idiot liberals in DC don't get it. It's as if there is no problem.<br>
I appreciate the hell out of most of what Paul thinks and espouse.<br>
The thing is, it's not going to happen.<br>
The best thing that we can hope for is a turn over in the Congress  and White House and some meaningful Tax Reform, Entitlement Reform, reduced spending, an end to baseline budgeting, some more privatization....<br>

For example, smg and AR2 dont kill nearly as fast as they used to, shotty is strange and doesnt generally do much damage, though sometimes it does, this leads me to believe that the hitreg is still off.<br>
Also the magnum is sometimes on, sometimes off, so sometimes u can just go bang bang bang kill kill kill, other times unload a few into some mofo and get nothing. <br>

Throwing with grav gun also does far less damage now, and is jerky (or maybe I was on a dreaded 100-tick server, idk).

Now this is just paranoid thinking and should be discouraged<br>
<br>
As for 'not getting used to the new bugs' It doesn't take long, the game feels pretty much the same, the only thing thats different is that you gotta wait just a little bit longer if you start a new strafe jump. <br>

I had similar notions 1ce back before FIOS aka the Golden age of DM when registry was decent and what not, anyways my old clan had a particular mod that made hl2dm in a similar style of Team Fortress class based with its infamous FIOS update our mod was ruined by coding shortly after they announced TF2 meh no biggie meanwhile the co-op style had a lot more options and most of there maps were zombie based, same update made rendering zombies a server crasher at the same time they dropped hints of a zombie based co-op also this glorious FIOS update ruined the hitboxes extraordinarily horrible and they put in a *fix* now when i say they ruined hitboxes some of you are like they have always been bad the hitboxes where so morbidly bad that just moving with sprint alone and shooting ppl moving or standing still 2-5 times and still not having a bullet register on them</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

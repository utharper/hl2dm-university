	<div class="content">I was checking out BurtonJ's steam page along with SPUF and Valve's page and out of the hundreds of friends and players, there was one DM player i recognized: Valiums.<br>
<br>
Not only is this game ignored by the gaming community, it is ignored by its makers.<br>
<br>
Attracting players is tough. as has been said, the learning curve is steep, though there are resources.<br>
The better more ownage type players HAVE been reaching out and there has been some effect.<br>
This site is important in this regards.<br>
<br>
Fact is, there are too many physics and general bugs to make DM a mainstream game.<br>
A large bump in popularity will only come from some fixes and sadly, that doesn't seem likely.<br>
<br>
I have chatted with BurtonJ and he has extended his regards to the DM community. he said he understands the frustration and will do whatever he personally can do.<br>
Nice guy.<br>
Not proud of my outbursts, but they were at least heard.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

hmm...i'm not sure if its not even about the bugs but the looks of it. i will explain:<br>
bump in popularity - the way it spells to me is  - more new players, right?. but new players don't know about bugs and don't even get to know them only after a good while of playing the game and increasing their skills.<br>
looks, well visuals for one..you have new games like Crysis and such that really look good ( and i'm btw one who preferrs the Source enviroment over Crysis..but in general...Crysis is regarded as an eye candy).<br>
by looks i mean ...engine update...now that's still due to release...i know i know...Valve ETAs are as clear as rain but...i'm a hopeless believer, call me dumb, but if this update will indeed take place then having HL2DM run in EP2 engine is truly amazing.<br>
<br>
another form of "looks" i think is, however it may sound groundless, more maps, FRIENDLY scrims and tournaments ...more posts BY community members on other game forums will help this game regain its rightful place.<br>
<br>
i think there is one guy only over at Valve's working on dm updates if at all...i might be wrong but this is how it looks to me...companies have their business agendas and i just think that instead of bitching about it we, if we indeed call ourselves a community, do what we can to help things.<br>
<br>
Look can also be less word fights, scrutiny, posting friends chat logs, animosity and a bit more coming together and we can say we're doing somehting for this game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He recently visited the Valve Headquarters in Seattle, and here are some pictures of his visit, with some of the main TF2 developers along with CSS. You must register to see the topic :<br>

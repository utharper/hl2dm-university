I would post this in the video section but that seems pretty dead. Anyway, most of you probably don't know me. I don't know many of you older players either. So I'll introduce myself. I am maspe36, co-founder of yeti, former NA CU admin. I'm one of the newer players to pick up the game and actually not suck huge fucking cocks at it. I'm not at serino tier or anyone similar for that matter. anyway enough of the bullshit watch my frags, these took place roughly 5 months apart? I may have more coming soon so yea (sorry for the minute long intro, i didnt make this video) <br>
<br>
if you want a download link Ill put it up (uncompressed unfortunately so itll be fucking 700 mb+)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Try to use more League and/or Tournament footage. Pub/Pugs are boring to watch unless it's a clan war scrim. Music was generically boring, some random rocker on the mic singing like like he has jizz down his throat. And possibly in some corner of the vid, state weather it's a "pub", "scrim", or "efps 2v2" or something so we know where the frags came from. <br>
<br>
The frag vid isn't total rubbish, I did enjoy the quality and the editing. However, u need to cut to the point and speed up some things rather than drag frags on. Also, need more "and now for the lulz" section.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>

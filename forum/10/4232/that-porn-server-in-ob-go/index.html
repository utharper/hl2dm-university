here are the bugs I have noticed so far:<br>
When moving side to side the model simply glides, there is no animation for that movement yet.<br>
I think anytime you have the rpg your in the jesus pose, at least phantom was while getting rpg on milieu.<br>
scoreboard could use some tweaking.<br>

Agreed. I also think that the Combine grav gun should be blue along with the hud and rebels should be orange. Looks alot better and defines the teams better. This is a huge leap from the earlier version I ran through. I also think it would be nice if he used the more popular dm maps as release maps (with permission ofcourse). There is no reason to have the same shitty release maps that hl2dm has with this mod.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes indeed it is and keep in mind it is still very beta, at this point it really needs to be tested good, bugs and oddities noted so a final can be as good as possible. But for me this is already better than normal dm at the beta stage.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i tried it yesterday and indeed it looks strange to see the players gliding.<br>
and i saw on their website that they had fixed the bug with disapearing shotgun  but sorry to say that bug is still there. most times (i think all the times) i didnt see my shotgun.<br>
playing with a ping off 125 was very laggy so i hope to test it out on a server in europe soon, so the test play would be better.<br>

The FUCK are you talking about?<br>
If it's about p0rnTube... That's my old spectate server, and it was CAL-overboard-relayed you dumbass, it was a source TV <em class="text-italics">inside</em>  a source TV - but that shit got stopped (disabled) when I had my guys at fatpipe switch my server over to the OB beta. <br>
And why does it seem like you are on fucking steroids and heroin every time you post on these forums? <br>
<br>
ugh.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I am setting up fireworks at a gig in D.C so I am not at home and on a friendâ€™s shitty laptop. So I am not gonna get hlsw and/or steam and see if my server crashed or w/e, chances are impala is just being retarded and is screaming incoherently at his computer. <br>
<br>
If someone could see if my shit is still good, I would really appreciate it. <br>
Last I checked if you have properly installed the OB beta 3 it would run nice and smooth on my server, is that still the case?<br>
<br>
Someone with more patience help impala, start by pulling that giant syringe out of his ass.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Do i have to come to your house and explain what is already EXPLAINED in the prior post?!?!<br>
Are you STUPID and unable to read english?<br>
<br>
Disable your spectate mode when your not allowing spectating.<br>
Is that too hard for you?<br>
Just goes to show the capability of the browser and nobody uses it.<br>
<br>
So, Check yourself rabid ass.<br>
Hell, the one OB server and it will be the same SERVER IS FULL with 1 godamn jerk showing in the browser.<br>

I have just one server up, my main gameserver, running OB:3. <br>
I have not tried to spectate in it but one time when myself, phantom, and some british guy were playing octagon on it, the third fella went into spectate fine.<br>
<br>
I really don't like the Idea of complete fucktards testing this beta out. <br>
I would say that impala is not a good tester becasue his head is up his ass, but now it appears that would be quite a feat for him becasue he does not know his on ass from a fucking hole in the ground.<br>
<br>
But that is enough, I am done with you. Get a Job. <br>
<br>
Anywho:
<blockquote><div><cite>Zman42 wrote:</cite>also screen is red for wayyyy too long when hit.</div></blockquote>
That is a seemingly random error I have found in regular DM. <br>
I, however, have not had the screen go horribly red on me in this new beta (yet). <br>
<br>
I do agree that now is the time for working on the basic mechanics and ironing out the bugs of this beta, but I do hope that in the future this red pain-effect shit gets the boot. <br>
<br>
I don't need my display to have a fucking period every time billy rapes me with a shotty on tig. srsly. <br>
For now, it is not a priority, but I do hope it becomes one - that and making it so orbs don't make your screen bounce around. <br>
<br>
Although I doubt the latter part of that statement will be as popular, I still don't think its a needed effect. <br>
It made the single player more immersive and stuff, but we don't need it in crowded pubs adding to the annoying atmosphere of orb spam.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

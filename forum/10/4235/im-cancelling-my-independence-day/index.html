	<div class="content">The title says it all, north korea launched a bunch of medium ranged SCUD missiles into the ocean so I'm over here scared and submissive.<br>
<br>
The US has never dealt with such technology and certainly never had any clue how to stop a scud missile, obviously korea has become a warfare powerhouse right under our noses.<br>
<br>
I'm actually considering surrender to the superpower that is korea and hope for some mercy, obviously they will conquer us by like.....next tuesday and shit.<br>
<br>
To be serious though, this shit is sad I thought bush was bad but these latest mental cases from iran and korea make him look like a genious.<br>
<br>
If korea is so ballsy why not take over the PRC? I mean clearly they have the power to do so from what they say, I wonder why they still have not attacked South Korea like they promised they would since we won't stop shadowing their tugboats, they said they would firestorm south korea if we got involved, then it turned into "we will do it if you try to free your prisoners" and now it's "we will do it if your military attacks".<br>
<br>
I'm also sure Japan just loves these cheaply built ordinance flying right over their heads that's really friendly.<br>
<br>
Why isn't this website shut down yet? north korea is going to be pissed when they see it isn't.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They are hurting too. The other countries economies are intertwined around ours. Ive been saying this for a while, but from the looks of it, the only way to get out of this is to have another war, sort of like how World War 2 got us out of the Depression. And the lucky people on the other end of the gun would be Korea because no one likes them right now and they are just chirping away about how big and bad they are.

I agree, the thing is that even US/UK/Russia altogether wouldn't be able to set foot in China. And China can't set foot in the US because of the long distance and the Ocean. Nazi Germany had the best weapons and technology in the WW2, but Russia sent hordes of soldiers (20 million died), and they finally defeated Germany. But yeah, we are talking about an ocean here, even the biggest fleet in the world couldn't move such a big army like China's.<br>

Not freeze to death, that was Napoleon, lawl.

First you say we launch 30 missiles a day as if it were equal to north koreas threats against anybody that looks at them, then you say we test nukes in the Pacific and pollute the Americas, then you say China over all but China knew full well the consequences of testing nukes in the ocean (Pacific to be precise) the same consequences that stopped us in our tracks upon realization, China continues to do it for 20 years afterward disregarding the proven side effects.<br>
<br>
I don't think you were aware of what you were saying.<br>
<br>
I guess in this day and age countries can do whatever the fuck they want as long as they aren't the USA, Britain or Canada.<br>
<br>
The public just blindly blames the superpowers for shit they could have never done, but we can be a scapegoat that's fine until upstart commie leaders go batshit insane and threaten nuclear holocaust upon their neighbors with no provocation, that fuckhead has base level ICBM missiles for the first time and he couldn't wait to threaten every motherfucker in the world with their cheaply built behind the times weaponry.<br>
<br>
But I guess that's ok if you're not involved with western civilization right? If we said anything remotely close to what north korea has it would be "omg fuck the US they should all be castrated like the bunch of fucks they are!"<br>

<br>
;/   Hate to say it but the single largest factor of being there is the bountiful oil, as well finally being able to empire build in the heart of the middle east. One of the last places to not be under de facto western control besides China/Russia, and a few countries in Africa being puppeted by China and Russia. We just would not wage a war even with a massive attack like 9/11 unless there are more multi-faceted economical and territorial reasons behind it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Yeah that's correct, the cold was a negative factor for the Germans in Russia but it wasn't the principal reason why they retreated. Their uniforms and boots were very modern, actual uniforms pretty much likely their's (even the helmets). But with no food, fuel, ammo, they had to retreat (plus the cold, and when you don't eat you feel colder).<br>

Well that sounds like a myth or urban legend. But the fact is that highly experienced and talented soldiers many times work as mercenaries when something goes wrong, and they don't represent a nation (most of the times they wear black uniform).<br>

This is a whole different situation than WWII and what happened after that with regard to economic growth in this country.  We are already fighting a war and I dont see any economic growth coming from that whatsoever.  In fact, quite the opposite but that was overshadowed by the mortgage/wallstreet debacle.  Considering we had the highest deficit in recorded history thanks to Bush and his vendetta to avenge his family honor plus Iraq in general, and we are billions more in debt due to the banks/wallstreet bailout, I dont think we can really afford to put even more billions of dollars into a war with Korea.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lol dude, what I mean is that if you leave them alone nothing will happend. If you want them to be capitalist and export/import products valued in US Dollars, then there'll be war, just like Iraq. Saddam wanted to trade oil with Euros instead of dollars and see what happened? Same with Chavez, he wants to save money in Euros instead of Dollars. Media is trying to show that Iran and North Korea are agressive and unstable, which might be not true (I say "might" because I don't live in any of those countries nor I have relatives there, so I can't assume if they are dictators or not, you should do the same).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thats the terrorist argument when they blow up in foreign soil. You mess with my country I mess with yours. And they say exactly the same "You don't want trouble, Don't start any".<br>
Nobody touched the US during the WW2, most of Germany's capital was made there. Japan did Pearl Harbor because the US violated the neutrality rules. It cutted all exports to Japan but not England. And Roosevelt/Churchill were very aware of this attack, but they said nothing about it to get your country into war, even more, Roosevelt ordered the fallback of 3 or 4 modern warships and left the "older" ones. And even more, Churchill ordered the assassination of a whole Dutch Uboat crew because they saw this Japanese fleet heading your way. Quoting Cristopher Creighton's book:<br>
<br>
"The decision to destroy the Dutch submarine K-XVII was taken for the following reasons.<br>
On 28 November 1941, when Commander Besancon sighted the Japanese fleet apparently heading for Pearl Harbour, he promptly signalled in code to the Commander-in-Chief, Royal Navy Far Eastern Command, under whose authority the Dutch were operating. His message was intercepted by the M Section code and cypher office in Singapore. Within hours, copies of the signal arrived in Washington for the eyes of General Donovan only, and in London, for Major Desmond Morton. Both men informed their masters, Roosevelt and Churchill. All four already knew of the planned attack on Pearl Harbour, and all had prayed that it would come about.<br>
At that time, eighty per cent of the American people were vehemently isolationist, and against war with either Japan or Germany. If Roosevelt declared war on Japan without any attack on American assets, the odds were that he would have been impeached. Conversely - as Donovan and Morton had secretly agreed - if America stayed out of the war, the Japanese would be left virtually unopposed to ravage India, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries in the Pacific and Indian oceans. To liberate such countris later might well have proved impossible. Besides, Britain and her allies desperately needed American help against Germany - and if the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour, it was certain that America would come into war.<br>
Yet if the British and American supremos knew of the impeding attack, why had the American forces in Pearl Harbour not been put on full alert? And why were the US warships not ordered to sea, where they would have been much safer, and able to fight back? Professional opinion of the day believed that the base could be successfully defended. So why was nothing done?<br>
The answer is simple. In Hawaii there were thousands of Japanese expatriates. Most were fiercely loyal to their adopted country, but a sizeable minority were not, and some of these had been spying for their homeland. Also, the Japanese Consulate-General was hyperactive. Had the base been put on full alert, Japanese High Command would have learnt about it in a few hours. The attack would have been cancelled by order of Emperor Hirohito, who had insisted that the assault be a complete surprise. Roosevelt would have lost his pretext for bringing America into the war, with disastrous results for the Allies.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">What had all this to do with K-XVII? The connection is clear. If everit became the public that Roosevelt and Churchill had known of the plan to attack Pearl Harbour, and had done nothing to forestall it, not only their careers, but quite probably the whole alliance, would have foundered. The Japanese have been free to conquer and pillage.<br>
The ship's company of K-XVII knew they had sighted the Japanese fleet and reported it to the highest authority. No matter how well-intentioned, such witnesses could prove dangerous. The Allied secret intelligence chiefs therefore decided that no risk could be taken, and the Dutch submariners were silenced.</strong>"<br>
<br>
This book was released when Churchill died. He said the author to do so.<br>
<br>
You see, I don't hate the US, but I hate when you think you are the "Good" and you do everything because of Human Rights and stuff. You are no different to all those you want to fight, and your government convince people by killing their own.<br>

	<div class="content">This revisionist history about how America shouldn't have dropped atomic bombs on Japan is a little naive. There were plans for a ground assault on Japan.  With the knowledge of island hopping up to that point, it was estimated that casualties would be over a quarter of a million. Operation Olympic would have called for landings on Kyushnu in November of 1945, and later assaults on  Honshu March of 1946. How much longer would the war have gone on? The Japanese didn't think with our campy Western minds about loss and gain and pragmatic decisions about giving up. The State Bushido, "way of the warrior" calls for no surrender and dying a good death. Okinawa was the site of mass suicides toward the end of the battle where over 12,000 US soldiers happened to have died (twice that of Iraq). Also, civilians were told that Americans were pillaging and raping them as they invaded and so families did not have trouble killing themselves. It took two atomic bombs and the intervention of the Emperor himself (God) to end the war. <br>

If you think that Japan would not have gone to war with America if it had only embargoed England also then 'naive' couldn't begin to describe. What America did to England wasn't going to change anything.The embargo alone was enough for war. America and a lot of Western nations didn't like Japan seizing Manchuria, but what could they do about it? America embargoed metal, and later oil and everything else.<br>
<br>
Christopher Creighton? Who is this guy? His writing is more in the style of a fiction where he gets into the characters heads, saying stuff like "All four already knew of the planned attack on Pearl Harbour, and all had prayed that it would come about." The rest reeks of unbounded speculation. There's evidence that word got to Roosevelt about the possibility for attack, I'm not denying that. But how many reports got to him every day about attacks here, spies there, Japanese hot air balloons hitting L.A. over there? In times of war, there are reports for all manner of things, and having a Naval base on full alert for months on end is ludicrous esp. a well fortified base like Pearl Harbor. I just think it's easy to look for conspiracies in hindsight but when living it there just seems no way that Japan would make such a move against a fortified base. <br>

When you have ideals like "inalienable rights" or even "we hold these truths to be self evident", enlightenment values that maybe aren't as believed in anymore in America or Britain then regardless you are different from the nation who has an arbitrary monarch with divine lineage, or holds the ideals of Bushido or the ideals of Arian Superior race or the ideals of Death to the Infidels. You might not know it, but your wanting "We're no different from them" is that very ideal that put America on the map. Whatever gender or race as a person you get equal rights and the pursuit of happiness. And it shocks people with these enlightenment values that another nation might be genuinely different and not think like that. And differences are fine for me and most Americans. But that's not how a monarch who feels his power slipping sees it. It's decadent America's fault. And there'll be retaliation. And then Iraq will be a democracy with Enlightenment values.

There were plans for a ground assault on Japan.  With the knowledge of island hopping up to that point, it was estimated that casualties would be over a quarter of a million. Operation Olympic would have called for landings on Kyushnu in November of 1945, and later assaults on  Honshu March of 1946. How much longer would the war have gone on? The Japanese didn't think with our campy Western minds about loss and gain and pragmatic decisions about giving up. The State Bushido, "way of the warrior" calls for no surrender and dying a good death. Okinawa was the site of mass suicides toward the end of the battle where over 12,000 US soldiers happened to have died (twice that of Iraq). Also, civilians were told that Americans were pillaging and raping them as they invaded and so families did not have trouble killing themselves. It took two atomic bombs and the intervention of the Emperor himself (God) to end the war. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>s0iz wrote:</cite>
Thats the terrorist argument when they blow up in foreign soil. You mess with my country I mess with yours. And they say exactly the same "You don't want trouble, Don't start any".<br>
Nobody touched the US during the WW2, most of Germany's capital was made there. Japan did Pearl Harbor because the US violated the neutrality rules. It cutted all exports to Japan but not England. And Roosevelt/Churchill were very aware of this attack, but they said nothing about it to get your country into war, even more, Roosevelt ordered the fallback of 3 or 4 modern warships and left the "older" ones.</div></blockquote>

If you think that Japan would not have gone to war with America if it had only embargoed England also then 'naive' couldn't begin to describe. What America did to England wasn't going to change anything.The embargo alone was enough for war. America and a lot of Western nations didn't like Japan seizing Manchuria, but what could they do about it? America embargoed metal, and later oil and everything else.<br>
<br>
Christopher Creighton? Who is this guy? His writing is more in the style of a fiction where he gets into the characters heads, saying stuff like "All four already knew of the planned attack on Pearl Harbour, and all had prayed that it would come about." The rest reeks of unbounded speculation. There's evidence that word got to Roosevelt about the possibility for attack, I'm not denying that. But how many reports got to him every day about attacks here, spies there, Japanese hot air balloons hitting L.A. over there? In times of war, there are reports for all manner of things, and having a Naval base on full alert for months on end is ludicrous esp. a well fortified base like Pearl Harbor. I just think it's easy to look for conspiracies in hindsight but when living it there just seems no way that Japan would make such a move against a fortified base. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>s0iz wrote:</cite>

Nice reply. I respect your opinion and your points of view. If you like to have 10 wifes, eat dogshit or whatever you like to do. It's ok to me, but invading other country is never right.<br>
<br>
Cristopher Creighton is a nickname, I'm not sure what his real name is. The thing is that he wrote "OPJB" and was released when Churchill died. In the book there is a copy of letters from Churchill asking for this. He was one of the agents who worked under the M Section, who got Martin Bormann (Hitler's secretary and Treasury Keeper of the Third Reich) out of Germany to retrieve of the treasure and restore Europe, he only received orders from Morton, who only received orders from the King itself and Churchill. A nice book, nobody denied the facts from that book. It just costed me 11 pounds and it was delivered to my home.<br>

Defending allies? If anybody invaded other country, then there's no need to defend allies. Yes I know, this sounds absurd, it's like saying "if anybody killed someone then there wouldn't exist jails".

If Iran threats you, you can solve it talking. If they ask you for money or something, then yes they deserve to get their asses kicked. Because you are not dealing about ocupied territories. Unless they want you out of Iraq/Afghanistan or where ever you are now.<br>

Lol, yes they won the war. But if you ask high rank officers, they'll tell you how amused they got here when they saw the skills of our Air Force pilots (with shitty and old airplanes) who sunk many modern warships from the Royal Navy within minutes, and special forces commandos who took Falkland/Malvinas for the first time when were occupied by the Royal Army. The vast majority of our soldiers were non-trained low economic class kids (16-21 year old) from Chaco and Corrientes (the north of Argentina, extremly hot weather). And yes, they were sent there to get killed by the well trained, fit, prepared and equipped British soldiers. I don't denied it, the military method is the same here and in the US, they sent unemployed/uneducated people to fight face to face and set foot on groundzero. You see, the difference between you and me is that I am not blind by the fanatism of my country, I don't have problems in admiting good and bad things. I remain neutral. And I didn't say anything about Vietnam, a few villagemen with AK-47 succesfully defended their soil.<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way. The "Royal" Army asked for help to Chile and the US to fight against Argentina, a "thirdworld" country with WW2 combat equipment. We don't invest much in the army, but we do have free Schools and University with international acceptation for the whole population.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

far as im concerns you both morons thinking you can simplify the world so easily between who right and wrong. First off in war their no winners only lossers so touting your trumpet that "we" blow them to hell and we did such such to this lot is plain ignorant and disrespectful to those end up losing on both side I really would not take pride in ending anyone's life or even wish harm on a nation really.<br>
<br>
Another thing what's this using history who wants to hear that. I know history should be looked at so past mistakes are not repeated but it should not mean you should tie your self and use it as means to justify your actions. Thing is world change hell of allot and we no longer live in the coldwar (like a particular person here thinks) and not in a global power struggle of any kind. But lets try and get these things out of the way first dropping atom bomb should not be regard as a good thing but it was done and could not be undone but look at japan now their one of advance nation in electronics on this planet and I think that great plus many them are not holding anything against the US based stuff from the past. Other thing Iraq war should never of happened main bases for starting was well unfounded and misleading but never the less it happened and even reasons to make it peaceful place to justify it still wrong if you look at many women and child and men had to die as a result of it but its done lets hope at least something good would come out of it.<br>

What I meant by neutral was that I am not a fanatic of any country, not even mine. You instead defend yours even when you don't have to. When my country does something wrong, I don't lie or try to find the littlest good thing that might blablabla. If someone tries to invade Argentina, of course I'll defend it. And Iran also threated us, they named us between many other countries. But who cares, let them talk. As you said, they have mid range missiles. And Chile, always talking bullshit about us, saying that we stole them lands (when they have more than what they really should have). But guess what, we are not killing each other.<br>
<br>
In your previous post you were glorifying your army and saying that Russian weapons are shitty, and some others said about China having a poor budget. But yeah, now you seem to lost Vietnam because of Russia and China? They didn't fight the war, they simply were carrying AK-47 and mines.

My fiance wanted to work intel in the Marines after she graduated, but when she met me, she decided to stay away from it because she wanted to live her life with me. For me, I wanted to be in the shit. I wanted to be ground force SF, chilling in a office or in some base telling my soldiers to go jump into a high risk area knowing they wouldn't probably make it out is something I cant bear and part of why I wouldn't want to work any type of high priority intel job. Id rather work with my soldiers, not chill and watch them die. <br>
<br>
As for me, originally I planned to be a English teacher, but I don't like the current education system and refuse to teach for the sake of some impudent standards. So now I'm just gonna be a cop, unless we have a draft, and probably some of my family would get drafted and thus Id join.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its easier to say and state your pacifist arguments when you've been in the conditioned environment your in, reading your books and such, but when you live around it, and experience it first hand, you learn more then some 3rd person perspective written in a history book could ever teach you.</div></blockquote>

Well, that was the word then, "grunt". I thought you would understand by soldier, a regular soldier, not an officer. I always liked the military aswell, and there are many great things there. But when a jarhead grunt calls me ignorant, well, I don't feel like explaining a lot so I just generalized it. My advise to you, if you have a degree, is to work with it, and if possible out of the military, unless you are an engineer and would like to work in the intel or some labs. If not, you'll become an expendable asset for some pigs that really don't care about you.</div></blockquote>

My fiance wanted to work intel in the Marines after she graduated, but when she met me, she decided to stay away from it because she wanted to live her life with me. For me, I wanted to be in the shit. I wanted to be ground force SF, chilling in a office or in some base telling my soldiers to go jump into a high risk area knowing they wouldn't probably make it out is something I cant bear and part of why I wouldn't want to work any type of high priority intel job. Id rather work with my soldiers, not chill and watch them die. <br>
<br>
As for me, originally I planned to be a English teacher, but I don't like the current education system and refuse to teach for the sake of some impudent standards. So now I'm just gonna be a cop, unless we have a draft, and probably some of my family would get drafted and thus Id join.</div></blockquote>

Nice. Nowadays, I think a teacher, cop (clean one) or a doctor do a lot more than soldiers for their country. I just can't believe how people still wanting war and going to war in these time, when we have so much comunication and education than medieval times.<br>
<br>
And I don't believe in tyrans, that "dictator" of Iran is probably a ultranacionalist. I don't know what are his request but I'll try to find out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't know if it is correct to call it the US empire when the UK has never fallen and the Royal family is still alive enjoying all the stuff they can buy with the most powerful coin (I don't know if you call that a coin, anyway I think you understand) the Pound. They basically don't produce much but they buy the finest products from the whole world. Since medieval times these bastards have been invading countries and buying kings and now politicians. I don't hate UK citizens, but I don't understand how can they stand work day by day and love the Royal family, lol. <br>
<br>
Modern historians say that the WW1 was originated because England saw that Germany was becoming the new world power with their inventions like oil and gas. England had the vapor trains and the largest fleet in the world, but Germany was going to sent to hell all that. And well, it happened what happened. And I think we all know that WW2 was originated by WW1.<br>
<br>
Btw, Rome had fallen because they had nowhere to expand, their coin devaluated and they had no more new slaves and soldiers (no new conquer = no new treasures = no more new money = no new soldiers = no new slaves). Their economy collapsed. And well, the huge expansion also provoked failed communication and stuff. And talking about Romans, one of their Emperors had 3 historians who wrote the history he wanted to be written, lying and a lot; just like nowadays, huge business man have their own media and choose what must be seen and what must be not seen by the general public.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No it's really not hilarious, I know you didn't probably didnt learn a whole lot from the army manual and your AP history class in high school but Alexander the Great was revolutionary in the way he treated his subjects. He left their adminstrative policies and cultures untouched, leaving many of the existing high ranking government officials in place, of course installing a governor to make sure they would still be loyal and subject to his rule. He forced intermarriage of his least favorite generals to Persian women to signify his willingness to mix Macedonian and Persian culture (in ancient times inter-marriage of cultures was the most powerful way to creat unity in culture and territory, this however was shocking and disgusting to Macedonians that he try and mix cultures). He executed any governors, administrators and generals whom committed corruption and abuse toward a subject city-state, he even considered ending his entire military campaign early and return to his throne JUST to execute every single corrupt/abusive official in his government. Only during the last few years of his life did he start to ignore the corruption, which I will admit that for about two years he started to ignore the cries of abuse and corruption. <br>
<br>
As for the Muhammed, the revolutionary thing about what he did was to create a religion that was far looser, more unifying, more tolerant then any of the previous Arabic tribes ever had. The Arabic tribes at that respective time were in constant war, with two classes, the priviledged aristocrats and the very poor masses, a middle class was essentially non-existent which in turn created mass poverty and social stagnation. His laws were historically revolutionary in Arabic areas, giving extended rights to the poor, women, and  the rejecting aristicratic/hierarchel social order that had suffocated the Arabic tribes for so long. During the time of his living he spent much of it conquering, and did in fact treat certain tribes with what we would consider warcrimes, and did not treat the Jewish factions well at first, only later adopting a more lax view on them. The point is the new laws and religion he had put in place created a mass unity that provided long term peace, and believe it or not entirely openness to sciences and philosophy that the Christian church of those times had all but rejected and threw into the abyss. It was Islamic peoples were the ones actually rescued texts of Plato, Aristotle, Pyhthagreas and continued studies into their texts, without these Islamic scholars international scholars widely believe these texts and mathematical teachings could have been permanently lost. The rescued texts and interpretations of Pythagreom texts by Islamic scholars of course gave rise to modern Algebra from Islamic scholars. What I admire most about Muhammed's teachings I guess to say is his seperation of god from the sciences and philosophy, a fundamental problem with the Christian church at the time who threw away most of Greek and Roman sciences and philosophy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm perfectly aware of the history and what Islam has turned into as it progressed. Jesus and Muhammed both had designed very accepting, liberal, peaceful religions that accepted almost anyone into it's kingdoms at first. Unfortunately both religions were turned into warmachines, hardly suprising. Pope Urban II revolutionized the Christian church and it's clear restrictions of declaring war on a country that was not attacking, Urban II said that "Jesus was misquoted" and that war is perfectly acceptable IF the peoples are not of Christian faith, which was completely not Jesus' intentions. Later on Islam also too had prominant scholars that had suddenly claimed the Qu'ran was "misinterpretated" and "found" new entrances to justify aggressive wars, when Muhammed prophacised that God told him "God hates the aggressor in war" and will accordingly punish him. Just because ambitious, aggressive popes and Islamic scholars distorted and warped the Bible and the Qur'an doesnt mean I somehow view Jesus and Muhammed less for the courage they had to preach and introduce religions that at first were extremely tolerant and peaceful, far more tolerant the previous religions before them. Christianity was the first major western religion to formally accept ANYONE into it's kingdom, reguardless of wealth, race or gender, which I greaty admire Jesus' teachings for even though in general I find all religions false superstitions.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes Impala, believe it or not states subordinate to more powerful states such as Greece, Rome and Macedonia were officially known as client states. Also, I'm not mistaking civilization clashes with clashes of religion, often times they are directly parralel to eachother as factors in war, if not the primary reason for "civilization clashes". Civilization is a broad term that includes the paradigm of religion as a factor, so to exclude religion from "civilization clashes" is shortsighted. I swear I feel like I'm arguing with someone from the Flintstones, is anyone else around these forums willing to debate me, in a comprehensible, grammatically logical way? To suggest religion is not a primary factor many of the ancient wars is really absurd, your not even worth debating anymore, sorry. Take a class, buy a history book on ancient kingdoms, read about mystery cults, Zeus, the Christian crusades, jihad, the Jewish peoples never submitting to other religions and consequentially were continually oppressed and brought into war since the founding of city states, how religion was the primary factor in the shaping of the early Arabic area, how religion was the primary factor in the decisions of Pharaohs to commence war ect....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sorry I missed the part where I "insulted" religion. Was it the part where I told you how the Christian church used to be a docile, non-warlike entity until a pope wanted more power and effectively re-worded Christ that aggressive wars were afterall acceptable against non Christian peoples, hence the 1st Christian crusade?

Good point, but don't forget that the Islam invented and discovered many important things. Not only Greece but Saudi Arabia was great in Maths and science. And they knew how to create civilization in the middle of a fucking desert. The Islam is tough in a directly way, when the Church isn't; but it is in a indirectly way.<br>

Well you have decent points, and after his second re-election I did end up supporting his mission after realizing Iraqi peoples would simply be much better off with a democracy, any nation is. You and I both know George W. Bush will never be considered a great president, his leadership was continually viewed as weak with the exception of about a year and a half of popularity before and for a period after 9/11 while leaders like Julius, Augustus Caesar and Alexander had high popularity ratings from start to finish of their thrones. While in ancient days lies to get into war could be covered up and presented to the public in an unquestioned fashion, the modern times of a veracious media exposed quite a few lies and deceit, which the American public did not like, and will forever look upon down in distain, as well as the economy collapsing under his term whether it's his fault or not will forever be associated with his term, and theres no getting around it. If a Ronald Reagan type of leader/speaker was in there making powerful speeches, creating better lies, or coming out with some straight truths about why an invasion was needed it could've been an entirely different situation and view on what happened. Bush's leadership style just simply cannot compare to a Julius Caesar, an Augustus Caesar, a Ronald Reagan, Alexander the Great, a FDR, a Dwight Eisenhower, he's just simply lacking some intangible strong leadership qualities. As for Islamic scholars rescuing western culture being horseshit, I never said Islamic scholars "rescued western culture", I said they rescues specific texts, which had fallen into obscurity due to the profound wave of illiteracy in middle Europe from the Hellanistic Era to the Renaissance, for a thousand years there was widespread illiteracy and ancient texts thrown into obscurity. The game has changed in the criteria of being a great leader with the introduction of mass media and electronics, you cannot compare leaders from eras so far back to modern 21st century leaders because of this new x-factor.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL nice mix of wars. In the first place, in the 9/11 official report, Bin Laden was guilty and author of 9/11. He was an independent (no official support from any government) terrorist from Afghanistan. So what does that have to do with Iraq? About Japan, we talked about that. I'm not going to say it all over again. But if you like official facts and stuff, check Bush partners from Carlyle Group (Oh noes, it's Osama Bin Laden's brother D:, who would knew!). And I'm not going to post all your inversions after 9/11 and what does Carlyle Group do, just Google it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Have you ever been to an Islamic country? I have, and the few I've traveled to with my father for speeches were not "messes". In fact I've traveled to many, many countries with my father as a child for his speeches and everywhere I go I meet people like you, ethnocentric, uneducated, average intelligence, middle-lower class people blinded by false religions, political propaganda, nationalism and fear of the unknown. I have come to a realization however through this conversation, rulers and politicians need people like you to make their careers and secure their careers, they exploit fear from your ignorance and I'm realizing it's the most powerful tool of submission and loyalty to ones power over others. So as it turns out as a future lawyer and hopefully a politician I'm coming to like people like you more and more, because I know I can manipulate your ignorance through fear or well orchestrated lies in the end. So to Impala, besides the fact you think George W. will turn out to be a savior eventually, I salute you as another person who makes up the fabric of the largely ignorant, stablized and submissive United States.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The fact is people and nations dont get into a war because they love each other.  People die in wars and people justify it for power, religion, territory, money or a myriad of other reasons.  Not saying its right or good but it happens.  Saddam Hussein killed many many people before we went over there just because they didnt agree with him.  Dictators the world over have done the same.  Is it right to stand by and let them torture and kill other people who dont have the means to fight back?  If your neighbor was getting murdered, would you not step in to try and stop it or would you turn a blind eye and let him die and hope that the killer doesnt come after you?

Votes votes votes votes. Hitler and Mussolini were voted by the people. What makes people think that democracy is always honest? A man in a public charge (senator, president, whatever) can easily get bought by a richer country or company/entity.

From the Wiki in Saddam:<br>
As president, Saddam maintained power during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 through 1988, and throughout the Persian Gulf War of 1991. During these conflicts, Saddam suppressed several movements, particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively.

Maybe there was a reason people were trying to assasinate him?<br>
<br>
From the Wiki in Saddam:<br>
As president, Saddam maintained power during the Iran–Iraq War of 1980 through 1988, and throughout the Persian Gulf War of 1991. During these conflicts, Saddam suppressed several movements, particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively. Whereas some Arabs venerated him for his aggressive stance against foreign intervention and for his support for the Palestinians,[7] <span style="text-decoration:underline">other Arabs and Western leaders vilified him as the force behind both a deadly attack on northern Iraq in 1988 and, two years later, an invasion of Kuwait to the south</span>.</div></blockquote>

Yeah well maybe there was a reason why 9/11 happened T_T. You can't justify killing.<br>
<br>
It was a war, secret agents or special forces try to kill the leader or officers in the middle of a war.<br>
<br>
I think we all know that there'll always be complaining people. In Iraq there is some people who think that their new Democracy party is a cocksucker of the US, in Iran some people don't like their government, some others do. Blablabla. It's just like Karl Marx says. For every ideology, it'll be an anti-ideology.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I believe its called 'hate' and they certainly justified it in their minds didn't they?  Are they any more right?<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>s0iz wrote:</cite>

And they too probably justified it in their own minds.<br>

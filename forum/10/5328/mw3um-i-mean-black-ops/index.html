	<div class="content">so horrible.  ok, saying "black ops" which basically means missions that were highly classified, which is to say they can then add anything into the game because......meh, it might have happened.  and then to set the game during the cold war era which was almost 50 years long......wha?  just think of how many hundreds of world changing events occured during those 50 years.  rise and fall of the 3rd reich, rise and fall of the berlin wall, WWII, vietnam, korean war, Chernobyl, nuclear/atomic weapons being created and tested, corrupt insane communist nations.......the list goes on and on.  i dont get how they can create a game based on operations nobody knows all that much about during those 50 years. for one thing, what weapons do you include? what kinds of tanks and aircraft?  do the weapons change based on the maps?  when the fuck was anybody using exploding xbows?  omfg a remote control car bomb, pre-order....COD has gone down the shitter, i was hoping treyarch would fix IW mw2 fuck up, looks like they are just continuing on with it cause it sold so many copies</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah like capitalists and/or "democracies" aren't corrupt LOL.<br>
<br>
Black Ops copied pretty much gameplay from BC2. This "modern warfare" industry is going hell nowadays (MW1, MW2, MW3, BC2, MOH2010, BF3, etc)<br>
<br>
Fuck them all, I won't be buying any of those. MOH 2010 is horrible, BC2 has idiots playing 24/7 and I don't need to mention why MW2 isn't worth.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

BC2 is ok if it wasnt for the shitty engine not allowing mousewheel to bind stuff and getting stuck on tiny 1mm high objects ont he ground and havign to jump over them anmd not forgettign the entire community of whiners complaining about rocket spammage and stuff.<br>
Pretty sure the rise and fall of the 3rd reich did not happen during cold war.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I haven't seen nor played a good innovative FPS game since...well probably hl2dm. (Multiplayer wise) That's not to say all FPS's need to be innovative...I'd much rather have a more refined, well structured game more than anything but those guys that are making the COD games are just pumping out the same old shit with different textures and weapons. I have a copy of Call of Duty 2 and I can honestly say, from what I've seen of the newer COD titles, nothings changed. I haven't played any COD titles after COD 4 but I really don't think I need to. I can't say much for Battlefield titles as I haven't played them all that much. I own BF1942, BF2, and BF2142 and as far as I know they were pretty solid games but nothing interesting or new since I played BF 1942.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you havent tried cod5 then.  its nothing like cod4 or 6.  there are perks and weapon upgrades but they are not as obsurd.  my favorite WWII is still Red Orchestra but there's hardly anybody playing on american servers anymore, and the graphics are very out dated.  i very much enjoy WaW.  i think when the new RO comes out it will blow any WWII shooter out of the water tho</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

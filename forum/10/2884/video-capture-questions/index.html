	<div class="content">I get on average in game about 200+FPS at 1600x1200 max everything.  In an attempt to capture gameplay demo's I recorded using fraps i've run into some problems. Number One, FRAPS seems to only be able to capture MAX 60fps wich wouldnt be a problem if it didnt also cap my ingame frame rates as well. If you don't already know this there is a HUGE speed difference between 60FPS and 200+FPS. The demo's I recorded captured all of my movements as quickly as I did them HOWEVER the movies I attempt to capture do not. On top of that the 60FPS recorded is only played back at 30FPS making it like a highspeed video camera and everything is in slow motion. What I want to do is capture all of my movements in game and accuratley capture them on video. Everything I've tried to capture turns out incredibly slow compared to what I saw on my screen or very choppy. Since I recorded the demo's at such high framerates when capturing I also lose MANY frames of movement and I am unable to accuratly show whats going on. Any suggestions? Thanks!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">FRAPS is probably one of the worst programs I've ever used in over 20 years of using computers.  don't use it for anything.<br>
<br>
I tried to use FRAPS to record Peggle Extreme footage and it couldn't even do that, made the game crash.  that's when I uninstalled the POS.<br>
<br>
this game has a (much better) built-in movie recorder that negates any need for FRAPS or anything of the sort.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">recording in game without any other program is the best way to do it..first put in the frame rate you want to record at in the console host_framerate "number"<br>
<br>
then you put <br>
<br>
startmovie a                    .....or b or c, depending on  how many times you have recorded<br>
<br>
<br>
then that makes a bunch of tgas in your hl2dm folder that are numbered and all start with the letter you chose ( a in this case )<br>
<br>
then you use a free program called Vdub to make all the frames (tga files) into a video, <br>
normaly you go for about 30 fps.<br>
<br>
so put:<br>
<br>
host_framerate 30<br>
startmovie a<br>
then start vdub and put all your rendered frames together <br>
<br>
and when you want to record again use "startmovie b" and so on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

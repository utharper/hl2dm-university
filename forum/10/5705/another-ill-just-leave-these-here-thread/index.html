Correction: he tested the changing rates in 1v1's with me. He did exceedingly worse while fucking with them in that .cfg too. <br>
Things like 100/100 for phys_cannon so he could (theoretically) yo-yo better, and 66 to be "in line" with the server's tick rate for mag/precision weapons, 20/30 to be "default" and have less glitches while using the RPG, and etc. <br>
Still, he was nerd enough to experiment, which is why most of .ewR gets mad when I disclose this information. <br>
As I said in that long-gone moronic thread, it did not work out well for lil'timmy. He went back to the 100/100 shit, which is what I also use. <br>
DW's alleged "log" was either A). Fabricated or B). Billy being a moron and accidently using that POS .cfg <br>
It's prolly still on this website, all the doubters/haters can get it and use it and see how shitty it is for themselves. <br>
Or tweak it and still come to the same conclusion that the concept does nothing to help the one using it, except in the regard that it can fuck up other players trying to hit you with hitscan/physics. <br>
<br>
Much like what happens when people used to scrim $W in their server on LD and props would bounce off of luke considerably more than on the same map in ANY other server. <br>
I am not saying Luke "cheats." He has had this "thing" thrown at him before, but it was still extremely apparent and never really explained that well expect with the whole "its a fault in the game" shit.<br>
Luke is a nice guy and I love him as I do Consitpator. <br>
The aforementioned shit will be put to rest in the new eFPS with rules that allow all admins to have server ftp access and the minimum rates being 60/60 or something. <br>
 <br>
With regards to this current BS, Choco pops into spectate whenever he feels he is about to die in an "ill-legit" way; I would guess this rate shit is to try and protect him from props when someone has it in his face during a kbh pub and crap. <br>
No one should be concerned about what happens in the Nerf'd DM to begin with; NA players will only have a League in the Sub_Zero Mod and thats the only instance where one need be concerned about "unfair advantages." <br>
<br>
Chocoz is obviously a lonely tryhard anyhow. Let him do what he wants to feel "good." Be it playing with his rates or sticking a broomstick up his ass; it matters not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Mine is the size of a pimple and I have left my rates the EXACT same since march 2008 when Billy told me what to set them at: <br>
rate "60000"<br>
cl_updaterate "101" <br>
cl_cmdrate "101"<br>
cl_smooth "0"<br>
cl_interp_ratio "2.0" <br>
My actual rates would be capped at 100/100 of course.<br>
And I just now learned from edge that you should set your cl_interp to w/e your avg net_graph ping is: <br>
@my server: ping= 38  =&gt; cl_interp "0.038" <br>
@Punk's server: ping= 47  =&gt; cl_interp "0.047" <br>
<br>
cool shits. <br>
<br>
The KAC should have a set-match-go command, so you only have time to set your cl_interp once; then after a match.cfg is exec'd - you are kicked for trying to change it. <br>
Maybe thats a bad idea; I don't know jack crap about the subject, but I am just throwing this out there is all. <br>
The less variables that non-admin clients have control over, the better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Seriously, can anyone who has played this game as long as you have think that playing VALVe's version with  sprint delay and the new bug where you get stuck in the crouched animation, is better than Sub_Zero's mod?<br>
<br>
 Please be real!<br>
<br>
 I can say for sure that I have no interest what so ever in playing a league that uses a version of the game which I consider 10x worse than the original version of the game that was full of bugs to begin with. If there is any hope for a successful season of league play and one that is to be expected to be legit and fair it will be a league that is using a mod with a cfg that limits all the bugs and known bs, which VALVe's version can not do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well said Cheese. The OB mod is just enough "different" that playing both will throw off your game.<br>
Valve's hl2dm along with a actual working efps league could possibly stir new interest in the game (assuming they don't visit this site.)<br>
The movement is fine in vanilla hl2dm, assuming you can maintain a bunnyhop for more than a few hops.<br>

	<div class="content">You can play the league mod for a game that will adapt and get better at a steady (be it slow) rate, so long as James has ample feedback and tangible evidence. <br>
Valve has long abandoned hl2dm and will improve nothing; hell, even the better hit-reg in the initial week of source 2009 got nerf'd by the CS raw mouse input update. <br>
Mod exclusively for competitive players - Vs. - game that has been proven to only get worse and more ostracized as the years pass. <br>
<br>
If you prefer ignorance and less-dynamic movement (a common thing among COD/CS noobs) over understanding and in-human/faster-than-life combat, please stay-out of this mod.     <br>
<br>
I have had people like Carnage and Chocoz complain about the mod but refuse to give me demos. How can anyone see this so-called "fucked shit?"<br>
Leaves the door wide open for the "hack" accusations, guess hacks made for CS and 2009 have a hard time calibrating on a third-party mod.  <br>
Then Carn just sits in spec whilst in my server, whereas Chocoz pops into it when hes about to die. <br>
<br>
Those are the kind of people who prefer stock DM: ignoramuses. <br>
Impala will stay in it, cheese, etc.  <br>
Most of the bade-to-mediocre players like it 'casue then its harder to stay dynamic mid-combat and not die; hence my "shotting fish in barrel" analogy I used in a past thread. <br>
Also, THERE WAS A EFPS LEAGUE FOR STOCK DM, it died. I am not saying a OB one will be successful, but it is worth more of a shot than that of stock. <br>
I play both, be it I play stock under an alias account so that I do not incur the hypocrisy rhetoric (uh-oh). <br>
Playing both does NOT fuck up your game in either; people said the same about going back and forth between low and stock gravity, and they were wrong. <br>
Not trying to be a douche, except yes I am, but you were never *that* great at Classic DM Viper. I would not expect you to understand. <br>
<br>
Conflict, is it really so hard for you to install the mod and have you xhair (which can have an outline in the mod), .cfg, and otherwise all ready to go for the rare scrim? <br>
I am utterly positive you put forth more effort into your logos and graphic deign, of which I am a fan of, than it would take to extract and make ready the now dubbed "league-mod." <br>
Do you really need mouth-breathing noobs and chocoz, Conflict? How do such morons and tryhards make a broken game worthwhile? <br>
Man, shit, fuck; you used to be so freaking cool, the saving grace of $W. <br>
And I felt such a strong connection with you when I realized that no other DM player knew the superior strength of the Black-Woman's Vah-Jay-Jay. <br>

I've had the mod installed since Day 1. No one wants to scrim on it. Joining a game and idling on lockdown doesn't attract anybody.<br>
No drop-in/Have-fun is possible and the only way to get a game going is to organise on chat and shit, wich I don't feel like doing.<br>
Hell, it's been a month or so since 'ive even logged on steam.<br>
<br>
I do sincerely believe Sub-Zero's mod is, and has been the way to go since it's realse but it requires everybody thinking so.<br>
On paper it is excellent, in practice, not so much. It's a pain to find people who wants to play on it and when you do, if you win they'll ask to go play regular DM because the mod supposedly behaves ''weird as shit''.<br>
<br>
The only people left in this game ARE tryhards, just like any other old game with a 10-20 player base out there.<br>
(diablo 2 pvp scene, UT, Tribes, Quake 3 (not live) ) <br>
<br>
My gf's fine, thank you, altough she would be scared as fuck knowing a ''random forum guy with the gay guy avatar that constantly talks about his dick'' wants to know how we do. We didn't get married, ups and downs y'know.<br>

Man, sure is good that she cares not for these video game forums &amp; crap. <br>
<br>
Aren't you the Synergy FP guy? Francis Provost? Stop changing your name regardless, you're always gonna be conflict. <br>
A couple times when I tried to get synergy to play the mod, that FP guy would talk it down and say how "no one plays it." Guess he's all gay and shit.<br>
Even when .ewR still played, scrims had to be done through chat, it was just the only way. Even when sisterFister and redlight was around they would only be able to steam-chat-up a 2v2. <br>
<br>
It should be easy; we fuck around in stock then play for-reals in a more controlled and fair environment like the mod, which keeps the noobs/shiftyNigs out. <br>
And if you have not played in a month you should know that Edge has helped me streamline the OB scrim process, config's and KAC and such. <br>
<br>
The league may very well end up just being a social-type thing between 911 and Synergy, but at least there will be regular matches and demos taken to try and "bug-hunt." <br>
See, with this 'game' there actually *is* a point to finding bugs, because THIS coder will actually work to fix them; and unlike Janek, James cares for stock-only-style gameplay.<br>
Maybe eFPS should have a stock DM roleplay league, for that would prolly get VERY popular. Who can build the nicest house guys? <br>
<br>
When you do have any time conflict/provost/soviet-tank-guy, hit me up for a OB game. I have played quite a few w/ edge and I really don't mind losing to him/anyone. <br>
Dallas made it "my job" to get ALOT of feedback to James so he could tweak and fine tune the mod before the league debut, but alas, bum lookers be lazy. <br>
I even tried to reach out to mother-fucking Yard_Guy. Ugh, mmorpg's fuck dudes up just like goddamn coke/opiates.<br>

	<div class="content">I was under the impression that screwing with rates accomplished one thing and one thing only, making you harder to hit because of the lag it causes due to communication with the server. From what I have gathered over the years, you should set your rates based on the server tic as a rule. The actual "rate" command is a bit different though and you basically want that to be as high as your internet connection will allow it to be without causing loss. <br>
<br>
So an example would be (this is only a base of where to really start at):<br>
<br>
60 tic server:<br>
cl_cmdrate - 60<br>
cmd_updaterate - 60<br>
rate - as high as you can get it</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I call you that because you never really "knew" what it was like to take full advantage of the dynamic movement in hl2dm and the elliptical combat that ensues.  <br>
You are *ignorant* to it, and therefore do not care about "real" hl2dm in one way or another. Not saying you are to stupid to *learn* - mind you - but I doubt you want to (or care).  <br>
<br>
We are not asking OB mod to SOAR and have a pub scene with random people (noobs). <br>
People - including myself w/ alias account(s) - will pub in Nerfed DM. Some time later, when a scrim idea comes up, we play in the League-Mod. Sound good?<br>
For the non-shifty elitist peeps, it should.<br>
In fact, just 15 minutes ago my server was nearly full because I was just testing a map (beef's new one) with Batter than a bunch more people from the old community showed up. <br>
The mod is there for people who give-a-shit/actually-matter/allowed-to-breed in order for them to experience classic DM and have the opportunity to see it undergo slight improvements. <br>
Things allowing like bolts/spam to pass through items and their spawn points rather than disappear/blow-up; try standing atop the RPG platform in aim_arena and shotting a bolt through the floating-grenade-spawns and you will see what I speak of. <br>
James already has rectified such inequities in his new version, and he is just waiting to get more bugs captured on demo to see what he can do for a league-release.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am a like a broken, squawking, record-player about this stuff, but it is true: this mod can only get better whereas Vavle's can only get worse. <br>
Putting up with bullshit for tryhards and noobs is NOT a good idea. <br>
<br>
But what-the-fuck do I know? <br>

For me this would work for about one match until someone insisted that I play VALVe's version and then promptly killed me with a smg nade that I couldn't dodge because I was out of fucking sprint.<br>
You see there are people like myself who after playing the game a certain way for 6 years, will not be able to put up with that shit and would rather not play in a league or tournament if thats how it has to be.

<br>
Look at how MOST non-league matches starts:<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">HL2DM (Vanilla):</strong><br>
Most of us go pub on warfare arena, two guys from CLAN A sees two guys from CLAN B. asks for a match, then theres a 2v2.<br>
if the match is delayed by 5-6 minutes, i can go to some random killbox server to stomp some noobs to kill some time.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">OB MOD:</strong><br>
Ask your whole friendlist for a match, hope someone says yes.<br>
Me and my AFK friend are the only population the server list.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only thing that could solve the problem that mods (in general) are facing with HL would be a shared server list.<br>
<img src="http://fprovost.ca/hl2/hl2ServerList.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">With this, I don't have to:</strong><br>
Launch mod<br>
Check server list<br>
Realise that no one is there<br>
Close Mod<br>
<br>
Launch Vanilla Game<br>
Go pub / kill some time<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Instead I just:</strong><br>
Launch any game<br>
Quickly check what's up<br>
Join what I want<br>
Auto-Join a server on any source / OB game I have installed<br>
<br>
Sadly, it isn't reality. Why it isn't is still a mystery to me, as it is the most logical way to design a server list for an engine that is clearly made to encourage and live off mods in the long run.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As far as efps goes, there's pros and cons to either choice.<br>

I am sure you will realize what I am talking about very quickly then groan about how its not worth it and such, but w/e. <br>
Quake 3 is more of a circle, hl2dm is more of an ellipse. So yah, like what rejected said - 'eggs' around you - but I doubt that helps much.  <br>

I am still gonna try to get every-league map recompiled in source 2007 for better optimization and to have all textures and materials the map uses to be pack-rat'd and placed within that map as "custom" purely for redundancy. <br>
Material hacks = all wall textures being "glass" so you can "see" through them. <br>
My server is crappy for west coast people and as such will NOT be used for leagues, so I can leave it sv_pure 0; however, Dallas'/Edge's windows servers should have no issues whatsoever with sv_pure.   <br>

It was meant to be a compliment saying you may yet get very good and whatnot due to a lack of a ego/epeen and such. <br>

I have played a scrim with you in the League-Mod so I am sure I will have another opportunity to *show* you what I mean. If you care, that is. <br>

<br>
I think I have learned pretty much all you can learn in this game, but as far as executing it perfectly, well I am far from that.<br>

Yes I would have to agree, perhaps I've just adjusted to the current state of hl2dm. I would really like to play the OB mod for a few weeks on a server where I get low ping before I really offered an opinion I suppose.<br>

Yeah I would have to agree also, however, consider "newer" players ideas as well. Sometimes I feel as "old school" players simply ignore the new players ideas. (I.E. Lockdown still being played and rpg still being in aim_arena) &lt;--- Ok I guess Lockdown is ok... sorta...<br>

It's a good incentive to not screw around in the rooms.<br>
Games where the rpg is a possible threat are also faster paced ones. Makes it great when the players are evenly-matched. Not so great when it's lopsided. That's what I always thought at least.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Our anti-cheat plugins have been updated so that they will auto-ban anyone who attempts to use the hacks that Zeik distributed. If you are auto-banned from eFPS servers, that's it. You'll have a really hard time convincing me that you weren't for real when you turned your hacks on. <br>

Big thanks to opensource KAC and [IWC]Mike. Holy was a little overeager on his words, it does not block ALL LUA/LSS based scripts, as that is purely impossible, but the latest KAC restricts every known malicious use of this scripting known.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's actually 1.2.1 but the label was messed up. It's up to Holy what are the details of what it means for your server to be league eligible, there's still some things to be discussed there and how we can even enforce league ready servers. Also let us know if its slow, there are some commands and things we and Mike can tweak to optimize its performance and increase cheat protection. <br>
<br>
So it may not be the very final league ready plugin you need but its close.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its an opensource me was gonna post it no matter what as its an inheritantly public file and publically modified plugin. That said yeah, that discussion is gonna be made, and we'll be working on that question of having your server league ready, I.E. having an eFPs admin check server cVARS and settings before a match is executed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Didnt really fail since you got banned twice for trying some of the newbier hacks, it patched up most of the common scripts/hacks. AKA you have to work now to get past the current KAC. We are working on patching up the rest of the loopholes ATM. It still provides rate cycling protection, protection against the LSS wallhack Zeik had and most aimbots.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 [IWU]Mike has been patching up the rest of the LUA scripts, so far all of the public LSS/LUA hacks available for dload along with all of the hacks blur tested with us before that bypassed it are no longer working. I'm pretty sure once he's finalized all of the tweaks he's going to put up a dload link if anyones interested for server or testing purposes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

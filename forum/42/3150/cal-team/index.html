	<div class="content">Hi my name is Va|iums, I left 911 because my new school schedule of 16 credits won't allow me the time to practice with them on a regular basis and thus be a starter, we left on good terms. I've been AFK for a long time because my computer was out getting fixed and now on loan to my sister, it will be back this coming Monday. I have lots of experience, looking for both 2on2 and 4on4, though certain "friends" like to make fun of the prospect of me joining a 9th place team, I rather fantasize about showing the ways and strats to younger clans. My conditions are that you start me, and that while I will play every practice and CAL match marked on my calender I am able to, friends and school can't assure I will make every match. I barely practiced at all last year and had strong strong showings in all of my CAL 4on4's except for one on a map I never played. I am experienced, I turn on the juice for CAL matches and am hungry to prove it, let me know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lol...funny but kind of sad. Still though L2K you gotta admit that one round against UG| we played was one of the most epic rounds I've ever played at least to me, the end of that was hilarious! Anyway, thanks Impala and Chemical, another day or so and I'll make a final decision</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">the X-Gamers-Clan was started on Feb. 2nd, 2007.<br>
We are a Half-Life 2 clan and we welcome all to join.<br>
<br>
We have the following common sense rules for this clan:<br>
1. No swearing on the servers is permitted.<br>
2. No use of offensive player names or tags will be allowed.<br>
3. No use of porno or any other type of offensive sprays will be tolerated.<br>
<br>
more info here:  <a href="http://www.x-gamers-clan.com/forum/claninfo.asp?id=5" class="postlink">http://www.x-gamers-clan.com/forum/claninfo.asp?id=5</a><br>
<br>
We are not a CAL competetive clan but have some skilled players.  Maturity and sportmanship will win the day over skills.  Several members are military service, law enforcement, fire, search and rescue, etc.<br>
<br>
So visit our servers and see what you think:<br>

	<div class="content">X-Gamers is pleased to have added 4 new members this month.  <br>
<br>
Formal tryouts have been suspended in favor of just playing our servers so we can get to know a bit about you and your attitude towards the game.<br>
<br>
MERC Chickenrules has designed a new map for {=xXx=}.  dm_snipe_ultimate is currently running 3 different versions on our snipe server, the final version is due to be released soon.<br>
<br>
Somtaaw is working on a new {=xXx=} map version based upon his dm_snipe_delta models.  This map should be finished in the coming weeks.<br>
<br>
We are continuing to play intra-clan scrims every 4 to 5 days.  Scrim maps change and are weapon specific for variety.<br>
<br>
I'm currently working out the final details on an intra-clan King of the Hill contest.  Should be fun.<br>
<br>
As always, friendly scrims with other clans are welcome.<br>
<br>
Stop by our servers or website for a visit!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

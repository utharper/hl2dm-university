	<div class="content">hello<br>
I am looking for a clan that have other styles of playing than just magg-ing and bunny jumping and this way i have something to learn from them.I want a clan with more creativity and open minded to new styles of playing..<br>
Sometime ago i played in fraggies and when some people wanted the so called Pro i quitted the clan..I spec-ing maps where both sides played the same style..This is pathetic..I hope this game will not end up another CS or FEAR.The tendency in the last years is even the young players jump in the maggers bandwaggon and think this is the only way ... Who implemented this stupid mentality KILLED this game forever..<br>
COD 4, CS, FEAR etc have only weapons and plenty of quick kill weapons..Hl2DM have something special Physics, Grav Gun, Grenades..Why people try to kill the single original part of this game i have no idea..I ended up with people in maps that says physics is gay and so on..Is it more conforting, is it the winning factor or the point that everyone else play the same? Good players are stuck...Playing with magg all time and jumping like a bunny doesn't mean a good player.For me a camper and a magger is the same.They both usually stay in fixed positions from distance and kill from conforting position..A camper do the same..<br>
Here is my stats..<br>
<a href="http://hl2mp.tsgk.com/index.php?mode=playerinfo&amp;player=460039" class="postlink">http://hl2mp.tsgk.com/index.php?mode=pl ... yer=460039</a><br>

<br>
Thank you..<br>
Hope some newer clans will bring a new air to this game that is going to die.........</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

For example i see a limitation in mices today..<br>
Let me explain the concept.My mouse is an A4tech with 2500DPI but i realized that using HIGHER DPI vs Enhance mouse precision is a downside for my own playing style.I can't turn fast enough..And the connection is that today mices promote the playing WITHOUT enhance mouse precision for some reason and of course different style (at least mine) is not really possible.<br>
In general the whole community is stuck with a mentality about their hardware.I bought a DeathAdder and it sucks big time,i had an MX518 and same feeling..I can't suffer so high DPI.Also i get from my dad my old Logitech BJ 58 with 400 DPI or 800DPI not sure that track much nicer than the DeathAdder.Also the DeathAdder have problems with Enhance Mouse precision and the Logitech old mouse doesn't..That's awfull.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No one can call them self a competitive clan if they can't use every weapon and resource in the game to win. By saying you want to be in 1 and say you don't use particular weapons that is available in the game well your useless to any competitive clan out there and saying you want to be in one that only plays on your view point of limiting on what's available in the game is contradictory.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Oh this going great...<br>
Where is the skill in using mag because i am not finding it really.What's so hard to shot with it? .You need a good mouse, So called enhance mouse precision deactivated and you have everything you need to shoot with mag, bow and friends..Actually the mouse helps you deal with 80% of the problem the rest is just pointing.Maggers are very very boring.Take an enemy from 1 shot and almost instantly and if i have luck to get 25 health sometimes..You don't have to calculate too much of trajectory.Compare it with the barell shot from a large distance and wich one is easy to shot..Of course the mag..<br>
This skill with mag mentality is a whole stupidity and is dating from quake3 (railgun) and CS (4-6)..many forgot what is fun in games.<br>
Imagine 6 players playing the same magg+ bunny jump in killbox.. So what's the point of moving around map? just to show that you don't cook eggs in the same spot ?<br>
THis is disgusting...<br>
THere were some nice physics only large maps and those are the fun of the HL2 DM...Mag have no place in this game.Is killing the gameplay..<br>
I don't want to be good at this game (good = boring) i want to enjoy it and not lose time with players that i know their moves like my palm and playing with hordes of them on every server i join..It actually killed me any entuaziasm to be better..<br>
I would adore a BUG to kill the mag so everyone can become more creative...<br>

	<div class="content">You have not played folks like Nutrigrain then!  Frickin knock you down at full til bunnyhop.<br>
The mag is powerful like all hell.<br>
BUT, closing, shotty is strong.<br>
What i see is that the best players use them all and well.<br>
They are all situational.<br>
This is important because a map like Lockdown has areas where spam rules and some mag shots are appropriate.<br>
I used to be a bow whore but high health maps make it less effective.<br>
So, you have to gather and meet with the best weapon in the proper situation.<br>
<br>
The best players do that.<br>
Spec PB! He has a rep for shotty and YES he is very good but he uses it all.<br>
And its Shotty Shotty Shotty that is really boring.<br>
I don't see a lot of boring mag use.<br>
I do agree though. There should be plenty of physics on maps.<br>
Some, like Icepick, LV and Amp are lacking physics.<br>

I already saw what means competitive..I already played in clan matches when i was in fraggies but when it comes to so called pro all is gravitating around mag and shotty..And i am not becoming obssesed with mag for the sake of pro clans or competition..It's uselless.If there is a clan that wants people to bring some new air in their team and complete the maggers i am up.If not i don't care..I was entuziastic to join so called good players league but after i saw my clan mates how they play i got sick of it..<br>

lol you do realize that he had crashed (like most did on that map) and had about 40 more kills then that (and probably deaths too). Snail is very deserving to be on the best maggers list. Plus, that was an ILDM league match which was our first league since returning to hl2dm and he didnt have a clue how to bhop at that time making him a pretty easy target. In his prime, when he was playing daily, he was easily top 5 magsters that didn't hack. I like looking at the first round of our match where VQ40 manages to go 3 and 47 lmao<br>

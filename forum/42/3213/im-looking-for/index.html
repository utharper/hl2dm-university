	<div class="content">Either a good UK or European clan to play for. <br>
<br>
basically i got back in to dm a few months ago after not playing it for about a year and a half after moving back to the UK from Australia where i used to play in [CoD] and was helped to improve by people like pincus, noobles etc. I joined a clan which has gone really well, but now i've gotten back to the level of play i used to play the game at, i do not feel challenged any more and have no one to push me to progress further. <br>
<br>
so is there any UK based or European based clans that are currently recruiting and would like to try me out or give me a go. As i really want to start getting back in to matches and playing with people who are better then me which i know there are heaps of players, i just don't know where to look (so i can improve my game further by playing against a higher level of skill).<br>
<br>
Any help would be much appreciated. <br>
<br>
ps: i know ill probs get slated for this post it is the U after all, but i thought its worth a shot.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

why? You posted in "The Recruitment Office" which says - "Post recruitment notices, or let other knows you are looking for clan or team to join."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

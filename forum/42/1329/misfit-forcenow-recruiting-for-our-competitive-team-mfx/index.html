We have 4 members already paired up but we would like 4 more that are close to being cal ready as possible, that way we have enough for 2 x 2 and 4x 4 with back ups. We have consider doing it together with another clan that is just starting cal and put our resources together.<br>

Again ANY suggestion or help would be greatly appreciated, we want to do this right so we do not fail half way through the season. <br>

Being new to the CAL scene I can relate to Cyber's comment so here is the other point of view.  I see both sides of this so please dont flame the messenger.<br>
It can get pretty aggravating/discouraging to get annihilated (I dont mean lose, I mean crushed) almost every match / practice scrim.  I personally dont feel as tho I have any buisness playing with most of the CAL players and I doubt myself all the time.  Being new to CAL, I dont expect to win many if any matches, but when the scores are over 100 points difference, you kind of have to think to yourself "What the hell am I doing here?  This is supposed to be fun?"   Not to take anything away from the L33t teams, you deserve every win you get, but when you win the majority (or all) of your matches, I think you tend to forget what its like to lose all the time.  I cant say its happened to me personally, but I have witnessed some players that choose to rub your face in the fact that you suck with their comments and actions (spraying for example).  Is that really necessary?  That takes a lot of the enjoyment out of playing the game Are we trying to keep people in the game or chase them out?  .<br>
<br>
Some people take it too seriously and/or personally (I have done at times).  If it gets to the point where you are pounding the desk and destroying your equipment over it, it might be in your best interest not to do it.  I can't say I blame Cyber for not wanting to continue.  I dont get upset to that point over it, but I have thought about not playing in CAL next season and trying to concentrate on movement and other things.  The saying "If you cant take the heat, get out of the kitchen" comes to mind.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you mean the matchcomm system, there really is no other way to do it and have adequate proof that an attempt was made to play the match.  I overturned a few FW reports because I was able to see the matchcomm system.  We cant rely on Steam or email to be non-faked.<br>
<br>
That said, there was an issue with the fact that because matches were not being played on time, the scheduling of the next week's match was not done until Saturday night or Sunday morning.   We waited so that we could give the scheduler a chance to match teams based on performance rather than just a random pick so that teams with similiar performance (skill?) would be matched against each other.  Most of the time that did not happen and some teams got scheduled against each other twice because of it.<br>
<br>
I really dont know what the best solution here is.   I dont know if CAL would agree to this, but one idea is to make the match default days for 1v1, 2v2 and 4v4 for Friday, Saturday and Sunday respectively.  Scheduling for all would be done on Sunday night/Monday.  This would give teams all week to schedule.  However if teams continue to not schedule and wait like this season then moving the days will do no good at all and we are back in the same boat as we have been.  Our team has a set schedule every week (M,W,F) where we either practice or have a match.  It wasnt perfect and some weeks were tough, but it worked fairly well.  Other teams might want to try this.<br>
<br>
WT this thread has now been hijacked, maybe you could split the appropriate posts and move them to the League talk thread?  I would suggest spliting above Fearsome's Post and moving his and the remaining if you can.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also my team did not practice so we weren't ready. Obviously this was a big mistake going up against seasoned players. It had nothing to do with anyone else and I just got pissed off during the game...and if anything I expected taunts and what not from the other cal teams and didn't experience it at all, and I would like to thank Zman and Book for words of encouragement and help after the match and we willing to play a fun type match afterword....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Everyone has wanted to do this forever but you can't do it unless you can generate enough clans to break up into 2 divisions which each go to an 8 team playoff. And the only way that can happen is if people play. I was more concerned about some people who think CAL is some insane pro league or something and so don't play. People have to break out of that mentality and just show up and play. Yeah 1 or 2 games you get hammered but it works itself out. Eventually enough teams are active and it splits into 2 divisions.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

$W will still win. VDuS and UG will continue to win. People will drop out. It's not a matter of showing up to play. It's a mattered of getting creamed. You ever thought people DON'T WANT TO SHOW UP because they think they are going get owned again?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

My point exactly, no communication from the admins what so ever. If the admins would actually take the time to to post something in the news section about a deadline maybe teams wouldn't think they had time to finish matches, when they really didn't ( in past seasons, we always had a 2 week break between the final week and the scheduling of the playoffs, which was used to sort things out and get any final make up matches done).  But instead what you get is a admin who decides to just put their team in and leave other teams out because they simply felt like it ( Look at match comm, Khaos was making no more efforts to play our match, then we were). Well I hope it was worth it as you just showed that CAL is corrupt and admins teams can make playoffs when they had no more right to than other teams.<br>
<br>
My advice to you if you ever expect to have any success in the 4v4 division would be to make the season longer (like who really gives a shit how long it takes anyway) and allow 2 weeks for each match to be played. That way you might get something more than FW"S and FL's as getting 8 people together in one week is just too hard, going back and forth with teams who say no " we cant play on your day, play ours, and our time". Well ya know what some people have real lives and jobs and what not where they can just assemble and play in a minutes notice.<br>

	<div class="content">The match dates are the deadlines, that is what it says in the rules.   We have been lenient with letting them go to the weekend before we schedule the next week's matches.  That caused other problems, like not having alot of time before the match dates.  That is why we let it go to the weekend.  Most of the time the next weeks matches were scheduled on Sunday so that hopefully some of them could be scheduled based on performance.  Most of the time that did not work out cause the matches were not played even by then.  <br>
<br>
We cant wait forever for teams to get their matches done or we will all be playing this season with grey hair, in our rocking chairs while rubbing ben-gay on our hands and popping tylenol for arthritis.<br>
<br>
The problem is if we give a week beyond, the teams are going to drag it out until the last possible minute and it still wont get done and we still have the same problem and people will still complain.   I have heard people say that there had been a week beyond the last match date in the past.  I dont know because I was not around then.  Considering the high level of unreported and forfeit matches,  I honestly dont think it would have made a whole lot of difference.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">L2K your accusation is completely without grounds.  Khaos had every intention of playing you this weekend.  FYI It was not my decision to close off the deadline and I am not the 4v4 admin.  I did not sum the points, and I did not set up the brackets.   We didnt report the match against aXon cause we were GOING to play the damn match so the matchcomm doesnt make a damn bit of difference but here it is for all to view:<br>

Monday, Wednesdays or Fridays after 9pm EST works for us. We prefer to go sooner like M if possible. Server is 8.9.8.184:27015 pw will be kcal at least 15 minutes before match time. What works for you guys. L8z Mutant <br>

Im gonna have to talk to the team and get back to ya, Ive had a weird work schedule this week so maybe the weekend would be better for us, but Ill try to get a time asap and get back ]<br>
<br>
As of Friday 10PM you had not gotten back to us.  How long should we have waited?  Again we DID NOT report it so Khaos lost points as a result of that non-report.  WE (Khaos and aXon) were pre-empted by a deadline NEITHER of us knew about (thats right I didnt know about it either)!<br>
<br>
Here is the breakdown of the points for each team.<br>
                            <br>
aXon      W=1, L=1, FW=3, FL=1, Nonreport= 2   Total of 9 points    Matches actually played = 2 out of 8<br>
Love VP  W=0, L=4, FW=2, FL=1, Nonreport= 0   Total of 10 points  Matches actually played = 4 out of 8<br>
Khaos     W=1, L=3, FW=3, FL=0, Nonreport= 1   Total pf 13 points  Matches actually played = 4 out of 8<br>
<br>
Pretty sad ratio of played matches there by all teams.<br>
You had one Bye and you had 3 FW which you could have made up with ANY team that had a FW that week.  You had until week 6 to make those up but you probably could have done them in the last 2 weeks and still have them accepted.  If you had done that at least one of those 4 you would have made it into the play offs.  <br>
<br>
You are correct in one thing: a playoff spot is not a right.  You have to EARN it by participating.  You didnt do that, if you had, aXon would be there and not Khaos.  So instead of blaming yourself for your procrastination, you instead blame others of corruption.  Take responsibility for yourself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah that was my major problem, I didnt FW teams either out of respect, and I took their word when they said they wanted to play and would keep trying to get a date.<br>
<br>
Anyway, sorry for hijacking this thread MF I guess when it got off topic and WT it was still relevant I went overboard by going even further.<br>
<br>
This is the last thing I'm gonna say then Im done so no need to start a new thread.<br>
<br>
I see where the flaw is aside from me not taking FW"s. The flaw is this:<br>
Forfeits used to be worth 0 points, byes used to be worth 0 points. Now there somehow worth one point. (something that also wasn't posted in news or rules)<br>
<br>
The reason that they used to be worth 0 points is for 2 things really.<br>
<br>
Number one: Cal really cant get the scheduling right on a weekly basis, so there is a uneven amount of BYE's given out to teams across the board, therefore due to the shortcomings in CALS scheduling (this could be fixed by the admins BTW, if they took extra time and manually scheduled teams with BYE's against each other) it just automatically gives extra points to teams who don't deserve them on a weekly basis. So basically we have teams who get way more BYE's than other teams and consequently way more free points.<br>
<br>
Number two: By making a FW worth 1 point, teams have NO incentive to play there match. They can simply delay the match, then race to push the FW button at the default day and time (which BTW, leads to more work for the admins resolving disputes) This happed to us 2 times this season and the teams refused to do a make up match as they had a point.<br>
<br>
So in the end we got screwed simply because we weren't given 4 BYES like some teams, and also by the teams who simply wanted nothing more that a FW as they weren't really here to play anyway, but yet they were allowed to collect free points. So it was not that we did not try to play our matches Paradox (I take that as a insult) I spent a lot of time each week trying to contact people and get times worked out, but in some cases it just wasn't working with teams who wouldn't co-operate.<br>

	<div class="content">Well... I can so totally see all points here and this still doesn't discourage us from trying. Realistically speaking, who expects to go into Cal their first time and kick ass? You also have to know where you are as a player, I feel totally under developed now that I have switched hands, its going to take a heck of a lot longer than expected. I am not going to stop the team or drag it down, practice and training will continue as IF we were all going and when the time for cal comes around some do not feel comfortable enough to play, I hoped that the would be honest about it rather than going in and hating it. When Cal is here the best prepared people will  go, those are going to be the best for your team anyway, they will be the ones that practiced, the ones that showed up to meetings, etc. <br>
<br>
Scheduling is a bitch right now, to get people to practice, I can only imagine what it is for people to actually do matches that is why we are training extra people, just in case any of the other players bail then we have at least a way to show face and a good experience for people working towards cal who are not there yet. Everyone has had at least one or two people quti or get kicked out lately, that is just how the game of any competition goes, preparation is the key. <br>
<br>
Perhaps when you are running the team and being in it is simply to much, maybe there is a need for a coach of some sorts, someone who doesn't play but makes sure people do and helps with the extra training as well as a small crew? That is what I am trying to get my clan to do, those that can't play get to be involved either way.<br>
<br>
And perhaps I am just on drugs because getting people to help do much of anything as any other clan leader knows is like pulling teeth...<br>

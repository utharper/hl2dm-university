	<div class="content">Well, I'm not so sure using the HL2DMU name like that in the group is such a good idea without prior approval. I mean, if anything, a steam group with that name should at least be administered by someone who is approved by the HL2DMU. It seems that the intent with your initiative is in line with what this place promotes, so I'm not in any way detracting from your good initiative but there's even a process here of promoting ppl to trainer status.<br>
<br>
Maybe you could fill us in on some details here, like what kind of maps are you running on your server, if any special kind?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">This is fine for the most part, we encourage helping out others. I would prefer it if you just had a link in the group to <strong class="text-strong"><a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com" class="postlink">www.hl2dm-university.com</a></strong> rather than using it in the name. I dont want anyone to get confused between your group and ours. <br>
<br>
Having said that, you are welcome to come here and promote your group, it is in compliance with our advertising policy.<br>

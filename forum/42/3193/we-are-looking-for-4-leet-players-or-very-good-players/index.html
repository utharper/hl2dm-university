<br>
You came on here once to announce something about a bingo game you were setting up, which had nothing to do with this game or its community, another time you told us about your new clan website, which would have been fine, but you seem to treat this website as if it is provides a free advertising service, which is clearly not the case. I get the impression that you use this website as something close to a shoutbox for this game, e.g. you announce something and don't take the time to consider how that may reflect on you, your clan or your intentions. You use large, coloured fonts and have terrible grammar which makes me assume you are either a). an attention seeking nutjob or b) severely mentally challenged. <br>
<br>
PS. I was a bit drunk last night when I wrote that, I normally would not post things like that, even if I felt like that. The only reason I'm posting this is to "do some explarlin", as you put it. If you are doing this as a troll, you deserve some kind of award.

What does the number of servers you own have anything to do with your validity.....<br>
My clan has 12 servers at the moment and 50 people.......big deal.<br>
<br>
The number of servers does not give you (or me) the right to use these forums to blatently advertise your clan here.  The people running this site go out of their way to not promote any one clan or team because we are here for all.<br>
 <br>
It is fine if you are saying that you are recruiting, that is one of the functions of this site.  If you are looking for only skilled players, maybe say something about needing a tryout rather than say "only the l33t need apply".  That just makes you come off as a pompus ass.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What a pathetic response, you asked Raf to justify himself and he did, in return you insult him and his country which is both racist and extremely childish. Then try and big yourself up in a playground like fashion with the old "but my Dad drives a BMW and your Dads drives a Vauxhall" style comeback, pah! Can you not see you're only embarrassing yourself and your clan??? can you not see Rafs point?

	<div class="content">We are actually in the process of changing them all over to new servers, one of them was a TF2 Mod we were trying and one is the DMU training server.  We are just in the middle of the transition right now.  Half will be shut down and we will be down to 6 when its all said and done.  <br>
<br>
The clan account will be left with 4 HL2DM (1 modded pub, a CAL pub that can serve as an extra match server if needed and 2 private CALs) and 2 TF2 servers<br>
<br>
Besides that, 2 of my clan members also have a CAL server of their own.  So the total will be 8.  We have 10 CAL players at the moment.  Several of them are in 1v1 and we have 3 2v2 teams and a 4v4 team.  Its good to have a lot of private servers around for matches/scrims.  I dont want anyone having to forfeit for lack of a server.  I also need to have servers around to lend out to people in CAL that dont have a server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hello All,<br>
I would like to apologise for my comments towards all of you. I was out of order and i understand that. I do not normally share my personal life but i will have to today to justify my reaction to some of your comments. My brother is unfortunatley dying of terminal cancer. On the day Rafadagaffer made his first comment i was made aware of my brother's illness and obviously was very upset. I was not thinking at the time of writing the comment and did not think of the upset i may have caused. The reason for advertising bondbingo is also due to my brother. From the first time i mentioned Bondbingo to him, he always believed right from the start it would be a success. And so for him, I am trying to advertise everywhere BondBingo and make it a success as a dedication to my brother. <br>
I am sorry to everyone involved in this. Please can we move on.<br>

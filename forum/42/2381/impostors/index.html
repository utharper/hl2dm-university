	<div class="content">I have seen at least 2 people with the «Khaos» tag that are not in my clan.  Unless someone is listed on this roster: <a href="http://khaosclan.net/simplemachinesforum/index.php?topic=9.0" class="postlink">http://khaosclan.net/simplemachinesforu ... ?topic=9.0</a><br>
<br>
or in this steam group: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/khaos" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/khaos</a><br>
<br>
They are not a member of my clan and are immature posers with apparently nothing better to do but harrass other people.<br>

maybe these imposters are actually sincere?  they seemed that way to me, when I asked them about it.  I doubt they would have a reason to mislead me.  something about looking for someone to manage them or something or something.  guess i shouldnt speak for others, but maybe you shouldnt be blind either.  Khaos could use some worthy players besides Divinity, and only Divinity.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"><br>

so you sported the 911 tag before you were officially accepted?  circumvented their traditional path?  informed 911, sincerely, that they would be a better clan because you now have adopted them?  that's how that worked?<br>
<br>
any clan can use worthy new players.  why havent they been snapped up yet?  i know who one of them is, i personally dont have any real issues with him.  annoying as he can be.  but i know for a fact the chemistry would not benefit the clan as a whole.  i don't know who the other person is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

it HAS to be someone your entire team can work well with in that context, that is absolutely non-negotiable.<br>

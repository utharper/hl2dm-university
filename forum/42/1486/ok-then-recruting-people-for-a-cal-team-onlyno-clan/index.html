	<div class="content"><span style="color:#000080">Well, so now I am free of Clan leader duties of MF/MFX and 2 of my MFX mates will join me, we have about 3 possibles and are looking for more. This would be ideal for anyone working alone or in 2's, who are with a Clan that doesn't compete but do not want to leave their clan or whose clan allows for double tags. <br>
<br>
We are going to Cal for the first time but we are realistic about it, I am just right down giddy about the amount of dying I will be doing  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> This is going to be a serious team of course but trying to keep it fun all the way, life is too short to have such angst.<br>
<br>
Anyway, anyone interested please e-mail me at: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7626050f151e1906191b063611021d5b0218195815191b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cc9cbfb5afa4a3bca3a1bc8cabb8a7e1b8a2a3e2afa3a1">[emailÂ protected]</span></a> or add me!<br>
<br>
Name of team is to be determined, looking realistically for 6-8 decent players who want to give it a try! We have Cal ready practice server, I will probably set up a pub as well and forums and so on in the next couple of day.<br>
<br>
Good Luck, have FUN!<br>

	<div class="content">OK Pomp, As a new CAL player here is what I have learned so far.  Hopefully this helps you some.<br>
<br>
Developing a CAL team is gona take a lot of time and hard work.<br>
The team needs to practice and play together ALOT.<br>
The team needs to have schedules that match often to allow for practicing and playing ALOT<br>
You need to learn every inch of every CAL map including weapons, health, suit and spawn locations<br>
You need to come up with a names for the different areas on each map so that the team knows who is where<br>
You need to come up with several strategies (both offensive and defensive) for each map<br>
Your team needs to learn to communicate effectively<br>
You should expect to die a lot learning how to play with teams that have been together for years and have all of the above memorized plus have skill levels many times greater than your team.<br>
<br>
Thats pretty much what I have figured out so far....I am finding that its a rather large undertaking and a bit overwhelming.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Would love to have 2 MORE fighters! This would make the team 8, which I had originally hoped for making 4 groups for 2v2's and 2 groups for 4v4's, making it more feasible to meet our schedules and needs.<br>

Hence the purpose of the 1 v 1's. I'm going to try and stick it out this cal season and not let me get the best of myself. Also I'm gonna join a team that practices so it won't be so bad. Me and O-dog scrimmed timoz and crowbar and it was a good game and i kept my cool through both rounds. Basically last season we had no practice, no comm, and had to force ourselves to get matches. I think next season will be different.<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes Jesse I'm retarded and I change my mind a lot. Sorry :p</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

VALAR I clearly know what ebola is ty.. was a joke.. like haha <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
Stoopidity- Well.. I have no idea how it wen't last night, I hope we did so you guys will stop asking for matches, tired of RL asking right now when the team is just getting started and while I am sick. OBVIOUSLY, they check the most likely suspects for anemia, I am not bleeding from anywhere that you CAN see.. so they are going in tomorrow.. AGAIN... this time to look at sections of my BOWEL, STOMACH AND COLON that they could NOT see with all the past tests.. so funny joke..  :roll: (Also hard to find 4 people that WANT to play you guys, since your rep is that you are not nice and my experience last night was that you could BE NICER)<br>
<br>
Which brings makes me to think, in my experience with the LEET, the top team mates are the nicest.. do nothing but offer help such as Vdus, Flas and ~SW~ (ok, I twisted someones arm a little for ~SW~) People are helping with all kinds of things like Valar with some nice graphics all the way to taking me 3 times through techniques in lockdown_r3 like confused,  while some teams think that all they need is talent and offer nothing else but a nasty attitude towards the rest of the community. <br>
<br>
I know someone will come up with the IT JUST A GAME line... but even if it is, does it mean that you can't be nice? Wonder what some people are like in real person, and think twice if you think you will never meet some of these people. I have met about 10 people already in the year that I started playing DM, and with my move coming up, since I have no idea where I am moving, well I could end up being your next door neighbor. (if so, be careful.. I answer the door with my .44 magnum  concealed)  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>

Hey MoDuS_OpErAnDi, sorry you deleted the private message to me, was it good? Before you go and tell me off, I have a demo from last nights first map, I am indeed very glad I did not stick around. There is fun with the guys, and then there is acting like 12 year olds, which how this match went. Unless we HAVE to ( and I mean because Cal says we have to) fight RL again, please do not contact ANY of us for a match V. TEAM V, I am not interested in putting the guys through that again.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>

<br>
i havent even watched them yet, but im confident enough that we did nothing wrong, that i'll post them on here:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.redlight-gaming.net/demos/rl-vs-v.rar" class="postlink">http://www.redlight-gaming.net/demos/rl-vs-v.rar</a><br>
<br>
those are of the actually matches, we had a lot of off time inbetween, or after the match.. i dont remember, in which i spent a lot of time making fun of chad. This was making fun of chad, between me and him.. and i was the only one from redlight doing the teasing and never once made any snide remarks about your team, or you, or any players other than chad.<br>

	<div class="content">ok, so i watched the demos.<br>
<br>
and pomp im pretty sure i've found the source of your bleeding: your brain.<br>
<br>
because the only way you could find anything inappropriate in those match demos, is if your were completely fucked in the head.<br>
<br>
was it because we spawn killed? type killed? because if it was, seriously... good luck finding a team you like that plays in cal, the only reason your fucken sour is because thenewguy had to ring for you, and you could have had another player join at anytime, hes not even a member of redlight.<br>
<br>
so seriously, if you want to hate us, just hate us, no fucken reason to spin your fucken retarded tails of how "childish" we are, so bullshit.<br>
<br>
and about "how hard it is to find 4 people that want to play us", doesnt make much sense considering we are the most active competitive play clan in the game. go fuck yourself seriously, gl in cal, and everyone else in V, dont confuse these posts. i have NO PROBLEM with you guys and niether does anyone else from my team. good games last night, any time you free yourself from this twat's fuckin e-leash, hit us up for a game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

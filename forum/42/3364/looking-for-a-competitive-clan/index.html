A few things to consider when asking to join a clan and for your next reply to this post so people will know.<br>
<br>
Age?<br>
Previous clans?<br>
Do you know the basics like bhopping, strafe jumping, nade cooking, fast orbing, etc.<br>
Whats your location, because some clans are pst or est or cst or even just a bit of all of the above.<br>
Any previous aliases?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I wish I saved the demo of Kurtz beating Seagull.. it was a masterpiece. Safe to say probably no one except Seagull will be as good as he was in 1v1 or 4v4 which he was even better at somehow. BTW second what blas said, he came out of hiding and matched LukeGT at his prime and won overall I think, always nice to hope Z.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I remembered to be fair that Seagull beat him once too, they are 1-1 I guess.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Kurtz is always a good player, same with helk. He has good reflexes and instincts, which is something that can transfer to any game. However, it's hard to comeback to hl2dm after everyone has figured things out. I think he beat me the first round he came back, which is pretty impressive, but that was about it. You have to stick with it, or the skill curve will be too hard to catch back up with for occasional players.

but thats just my guess.</div></blockquote>
Yes, this is true, me and nate probably could have won. Although, it seems as though people never recall all the details of what happened. Could we have won? yes. Could we have won when the match was played? no. why? my internet was fucking up bad for a straight week. It was completely fine when we were scheduled to play, but everyone dinked around and the match didn't get played until like 4 weeks later. We all played a private match with each other before the real match to decide who should play. Nate, joule, and stinky performed the best, while i was freezing midair for several seconds and being an easy target for whoever wanted a free kill. Everyone agreed that if i played that match we probably would have gotten killed. Also I think i remember a specific quote from stinky who straight up asked me while i was freezing everywhere "man how can you even play like that?". I was not sabotaging my team by not playing, I was trying to give us the best shot at winning considering the circumstances. Would I have played if I believed that it was our best shot at beating sw? yes, but was it? no. So that's the story, yes we should have beaten sw. No, we shouldn't have waited ten years until my internet started acting up to play the match. We had plenty of time to do it, and we probably would have won if we played in this huge window of time, but that's not how things worked out. Anyways, I'm over it and I'd be willing to play with nate sometime if he ever wanted to come back to dm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

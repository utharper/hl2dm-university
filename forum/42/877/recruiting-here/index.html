	<div class="content">Meaning one of the best players HL2DM ever had was a guy named $ynology.  I knew of him because I watched a demo of him and some other awesome player named |911| Daedalus play a one on one.  Helk, $yn and Daedalus all retired around the same time. Anywho, so out of nowhere some guy named synology adds me to his steam friends, I thought it was the real syn as he played decent for his first day back in 2 years, and I decided we should start a clan together.  We decided on aXon, but I went inactive during the formation of the clan in which aXon Punk did all the work. Turns out this synology guy was just a poser who used the name to get my attention and alliegence with, I still don't know who it was to this day. That's the soap opera story of the day, hope u enjoyed it. P.S. Bad Influence come backkk!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

haha kin. I can't believe he started that clan, and nor do I recall that KiN turned into aXon.  I helped reapsta start KiN during the same time me and syn talked about his new clan. I believe the fake synology admitted he was a fraud and he had a pic of himself, I think he was black lol. Don't kno where he went.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Basically most of thats true but whats funny is he was telling me all the same stories as val and reapsta, and as far as we all knew we were the only leaders of the kin clan. <br>
Then one thing leads to another, Sin and I ( and unknown to me at the time obviously Val and now maybe even Blas) decided to start AXon as Kin was allready getting a bad name due to the fake Helk, which I'm not for sure but I think it was vdrei. <br>
I was watching the chat in hlsw as they were in my server, and I got the impression that they were both in on it together ( faking as helk and Syn)<br>
.Needless to say they were both kicked out of the clan, and I kept it going and here we are.<br>
<br>
Val for sure it was Kin that more or  less developed into aXon. I built both websites, one right after another, and put both servers up. I think I didn't see you after the first few days of aXon for like 6 months, so you might not remember that..<br>
I hope everyone enjoyed axon history 101 now back on topic, tryouts are open, we need one more dedicated player in 4v4.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Vdrei/slass/primal is a player whos been around a long time and is/was pretty good. The only problem he has was he was the king of aliases and or impersonating. I havent seen him playing for a few months, he's stuck in Azeroth with the other WoWzers.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

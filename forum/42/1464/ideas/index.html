	<div class="content">Seems like everyone is recruiting, old clans, new clans, revised clans, reformed clans, renamed clans and so on. This is making it very difficult to build a good solid team of serious and qualified competitive players to go to cal. Hard to get people to commit to begin with, we know we will loose some and well.. it is making me want to throw my hands up in the air and say forget it for this cal season. Now, I often though and I have mentioned this to some that perhaps 2 small clans could get together and form a CAL team, rather than trying to recruit new members into their clan, this way the two clans could share resources, responsibilities, etc. What do you guys think?<br>
<br>
How many people should a team be realistically be comprised of? Seems to me that you need your starter team and some back ups, what is the magic number?<br>

	<div class="content">It really depends on the people, their schedules and their ability/ desire to commit to what needs to be done.<br>
<br>
My thoughts now for Khaos is to have a minimum of 6.  4 would be the starters for the 4v4 team and 2 would be backups.  The 2 backups would be the starters for a 2v2 team with the 2 more available from the 4v4 being their backups.  This way everyone is guaranteed to be able to play each week if they want to. It also keeps everyone involved and enthusiastic (hopefully) if they aren't  the one getting left out.<br>
<br>
 Sometimes its too hard or too much for one person to be able to be the starter for both every week.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ill add that Khaos is still looking for at least one more to round out our 6.  <br>
<br>
That brings up another point Pomp, new teams like ours are most likely not going to attract the seasoned players.  We aren't  skilled enough yet and the chances of going far in the season are slim.  We need to grow our own team and get our asses beat up along the way.<br>
<br>
I have 2 home grown players that want to give it a go next season on 2v2 so I have 5 total.  I need one more for 4v4 to have teams as I described above.  <br>
<br>
If I can't find the 6th either someone will have to do double duty and be a starter for both or I go with just the 4v4 again with one backup or two 2v2 teams and someone gets left out and in the case of the 2 2v2, one team won't have a backup.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"><span style="color:#4000BF">It has become clear to me now that running a big clan (and doing 90%of the work) getting a team for cal, training, going to cal (and being in it myself) is an <em class="text-italics">IMPOSSIBILITY</em>. I made a decision to resign as clan leader of MF (effective May 1st) and take what is MFX away and make it its own cal clan of 6 people, that way there are really 3 2v2 teams and no one sits out too much, this is more realistic for me to do and do it well. (Yard_guy is saying I told you this 2 months ago POMPER  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> ) <br>
<br>
I have to work hard and training myself again, with all the wonderful help I am getting I have improved much but have little time to practice, so I have to get going, get my act together. Won't be easy for MF is a very tight clan but truth be told they are not entirely happy about the MFX division and its starting to wear on all of us, mainly me.<br>
<br>
Thank you all very much for your input and help!<br>

	<div class="content">I have had the same thoughts Pomp.  Not sure what I am going to do yet but I am leaning more the other way right now but I can't make that decision.  <br>
<br>
I have worked too hard to build Khaos and if either myself or my co-leader leaves it is done for.  It would probably take something pretty big or special for me to give it up.<br>
<br>
I also feel the need to be able to train and I am finding that I am having trouble doing that, run the clan (and all its divisions), keep our pub busy to try to attract more new members to grow our clan and team because there are basically 2-3 of us contributing to help that process along and its not enough.  I turn down scrims all the time because I don't want to abandon our pub server because I believe that to be the key to our existence as a clan/team right now.  That philosophy has worked so far.<br>
<br>
I love what we have done and I love our pub because we did it the way we wanted it. <br>
<br>
The double edged sword is that with Khaos right now, I can't participte in CAL the way I would like, but without Khaos there would be no CAL team for me. There really is no where that I can go where I would be accepted or that would work given my time zone and schedule.  <br>
<br>
Good luck with your team, I hope it works out for you all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Paradox, it is impossible to do both, especially with a clan that is about to hit 40 members, all very solid. This is important to me, I simply have no fun doing just the pub, sitting there day after day with zero challenge would just drive me to drink. I am not leaving the clan to no one to run it, I think this time they are prepare to pick up the work once I am gone and if not I can't be doing stuff for other people and ignoring what I would like to do, even if I never get anywhere.. so I can say I tried.

	<div class="content">Honestly I say just go for it several seasons $W has said I am not sure we can get enough together, your thinking what the team that has won so many? But yes that's the way it is. The funny thing is when we think we just do not have enough time or players it seems we still make it we just barely slide by. You don't lose anything by trying you just become a better player and if MF falls apart you can either recruit more or the players that are on it can join other teams. In competition no one forces you to play on a team you are in a "clan" with. So you see some guys like OFC Iowa Moe who are in clans that won't compete joining teams like Khaos who do compete. The more important thing is do take a couple extra players but take people with good attitudes cause bad ones will wreck your clan faster then anything else they won't show up even when they can and they will quti matches half way through when they are losing leaving you short handed. Also realize people have real lives that sometimes get in the way so you will see 1 player kinda become less active for a while maybe even claim to quti the game, but pretty soon they will be back. The other thing is as more new clans join other new clans will follow suit cause there will be a wider range of skills. And in the end everyone will be happier as they play more clans closer to them in skill. I think the main point I have here is that you do not need all the details worked out ahead of time you sorta just jump in the water and learn how to swim.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

NM, yeah I know originally I was going to take a break, this has been going on for a while and there was more stuff that just came out when things got ugly. I never wanted MF to get that big but as it is is more for socialization than anything else, which is fine, just not what I had hoped for. Had they been more supportive of me and my adventures, perhaps we could have come to a better understanding, but it is what is.<br>

DMF isn't a clan. Its a community group that anyone can join (and wear the tag) that believes that having fun, good sportsmanship, and mutual respect are what its all about. I was considering starting a clan, but my schedule is too crazy to be reliable for organized stuff. Especially around the holidays!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I did say I did not want to be the boss of MF anymore, too much work for too little reward for me, I feel like out grew them so did O-dog. Team veracity was dead after our first Warzone season and once I was left alone I figure I should weigh my options.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>
<br>
If I would start another clan it would be tiny, it's very difficult running a clan that was anywhere between 30 and 40 people at all times, doing everything for it, while running team V with O-Dog and trying to gain some skills.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
MF decided to stay non competitive and pretty much the way it is now, no matter how much I would want to change it, it wouldn't, so rather than beating a dead horse I let them have what they are happy with and I moved on.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/deadhorse.gif" width="74" height="37" alt=":deadhorse:" title="Dead Horse"> <br>
<br>
If I just wanted to be the member of any clan, I have plenty of choices, but I am looking specifically for a small clan that competes that is well organized [but that may be too much to ask for] so if that doesn't happen was considering of making the small clan or team like team V was. I don't think what I posted was that complicated BI..  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>

I realize that our system won't work for a larger clan but we just sorta all manage ourselves and eachother lol...helps if your tight with your clanmates though. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I had to do it because we currently have 5 servers to maintain plus a fast download server and a website and that is a lot of work.  I also gave our pub server over to my co-leader.  In case you dont realize it we had 60 people in our clan at one point, its down around 50 or so now.  More people = more work.  And BTW, I am not complaining, just commenting that it can be a bit tiring at times.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have hear it from MANY clan leaders, same complains people want stuff done but they don't pitch in. Also, I know you don't want to hear it BUT being a woman clan leader is harder, you try to manage a clan full of mouthy teenagers and grumpy older men without being called a bitch.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> There is a reason my hate group is filled of ex CLAN members [MF]  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>

	<div class="content">Thank you Pomp.  In many ways I am very very lucky.  Yes we have our share of younger members and yes some of them have egos that go along with being young guys. However when it really comes down to it, we are a clan and a team and we have made decisions as such and supported each other as such.  Yes we have had our share of issues, but we have come through it all because of the friendships we have made.  You cant get any group of people together anywhere without some politics coming up once in a while.  I have learned to get involved only with the issues that are important to the clan and I have learned that I cant do everything and everything I do takes time.   Many of my members, and most of those that hold leadership postions are older, more established guys, many with wives and families.  They support me and I support them.   We share one thing: we love the games we play and we want to run a good clan with good people and good attitudes.  We look for people that share those ideals.  For the most part we have accomplished that and it is something all of us are very proud of.  I am proud of all of them and I am proud to call them my clan.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well my point is, we all have to see you complain on a daily basis about shit you bring on to your self.  IMO, you love being the boss.  you were looking for a clan to join were you didnt have to be the boss, supposedly by your own admittion you got a ton of offers but you didnt accept them. now your starting a new project after stating that you didnt want to be in charge of anything except the KB division, which is fine if thats really what you want to do, even though you said you DIDNT want to do it, and now, once again, the fucking U forum is going to be filled with your FUCKING posts about how hard your fucking life is dealing with your clan/project members.  you HAVE to be in charge of something, thats apperently your nature.  good for you if thats you thing, i have no problem with that.  but dont post your feel fucking sorry for me bull shit when it was your choice to do it.  nobody feels bad for you, everybody's got tons of shit going on, everybody'sl life sucks right now due to this economy, get the fuck over it.  EE's active member list is in the top 5, you dont see rico on here bitching about it.  all you do is look for attention, which is prolly why you never stfu in pub matches. you prolly dont even realize that 90% of the ppl your blabbing to have muted you.  you dont have to make a comment about every little thing that happens in a match.  good luck with the delta clan/project</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Look... The team NOT clan I made is for some non leets and rogue players to learn to work as a team, did anyone bother to look at the steam group?  did anyone see who is in it? you guys probably do not know most of these people. They are people I have played for years now who I enjoy playing with, exactly where was the harm? [My motives for picking the triangle or pyramid as I see it have nothing with what you guys think, Briggs is closer to the mark]<br>
<br>
I am not in Cal or Warzone competition on a player or manager lever, I am cal admin and plan to dedicate my time to that. Would that be ok with you guys? <br>
<br>
I <em class="text-italics">OUTGREW</em> my clan MF, when they leave when you arrive, you know it is time to go, some of you guys switch clans like you switch underwear, so again I ask... where is the harm? Team Veracity had a good first season and the fizzled, I am sure it is not the first team or clan to last only 1 season, so it was disbanded, again... where was the harm? <br>
<br>
So I threw it out there, maybe someone is willing to teach me more, is that wrong? Apparently there is no LEET clan in the universe who is willing to do it. I thought the U was for people to come and ask JUST that, for someone to teach them or to join a new clan, but maybe I misread that somewhere, or maybe just for the chosen few. <br>
<br>
Several large clans said they would be happy to have me but they are non-competitive, so I am not doing that, would that be ok with you guys, because I apparently have to defend my every word. Chem is going to suffer an heart attackthe next time he post something directed to me, I still like to know why he is so invested in what I am doing or not doing, posting or not posting.<br>
<br>
AGAIN if my post bother me I tell you how not to read them, there is a section to add friends or enemies [in your use control panel] it will automatically stop showing my posts, you decided if its a subject worth reading. Now if you know you already do not like me or my posts, why were you reading this one to begin with? Clearly, you guys enjoy reading stuff, finding the fault and tearing people apart, I am not the only one that gets that special treatment. <br>
<br>
So you guys tell me, who is out of control? I am just trying to stay involved in a game that is DYING, in case no one noticed or cared.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Personally Pomp I feel you have the right to do what you want and No it was not wrong for you to throw it out there as you say.  However, this is just a point of fact for you: so called "LEET" clans dont recruit anyone but LEET players, simple as that.   SW, VDuS and now FLaS are all like that.  If they did recruit non-leets, I probably would have joined one of them rather than start Khaos because at the time I didnt want the responisbility much as you dont now and I know it would have been the best way to learn.  <br>
<br>
Remember though that some of the members of LEET clans (Luke, Zman) are willing to teach you if you are willing to meet them half way and put in the effort, you just cant do it with their tag in front of your name.   Both have offered to help me and Luke has spent quite a bit of time with my team to help them.  Khaos is not a LEET clan, but we are working on it, we already have 2 CAL admins on it and according to CAL admin rules, we cant have 3.<br>
<br>
So good luck with your new team and we will see you in CAL.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have always welcomed any help, both Zman and Luke have helped me as well, again... did I misread the purpose of this section?? My mistake, thought it was kind of a place to put basically what you wished to find in a clan/team. <br>
<br>
My point is if we knock everyone down for even trying, how many people will stick around? People read your replies to other people, a lot of them are not necessarily nice. What can new players hope for? How will the current leet clans get any more competition? How do we get any more clans in cal? I am being criticized for doing exactly what the university was made for, hope for more, try to get better, try to advance, LEARN, etc. <br>
<br>
Frankly it's no wonder this game is so in the dumps, we need fresh blood, we need to recruit new players and nurture them into becoming leet players, when you discourage one you discourage many. <br>
<br>
So let's say the ones that don't like me win, I leave the game, what exactly do they win? How are THEY benefiting the game? I mean whats the point of constantly trying to crush others in these forums, again YOU DON'T LIKE ME DO NOT READ MY POSTS! I doubt Chem read my post because he thought "Hey Pomp posted something in the recruitment section, in the interest of EE, I need to read THAT.."  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Pomp, when I started playing this game, I had no idea what CAL was or who SW or VDuS were and when I did begin to encounter them I wanted nothing to do with CAL.  I still played the game and as my skill at it increased,  one day I began to get bored to death creaming newer players and chasing them out of servers.  I realized that I had to challenge myself again to keep interested.  So I began to seek out the CAL players and play with them in the few CAL pubs they would play on.  I did it because I love the game and I realized it was dying and I wanted to get to know some of those people before it and they were gone.   It was fun, I made some new friends and it motivated me to continue to learn and improve and it increased my love of the game.<br>
<br>
I think that is pretty much where you are right, now however unlike me maybe you didnt realize what I stated before:  "Leet" clans only recruit leet players, its just the way it is.  There is too much pressure on them to stay on top they can't afford to have lesser players on their team.  <br>
<br>
Those of us stuck in between the "noobs" and the "leets" have to start at the bottom and build it ourselves but as you know, some of those "leet" players are willing to help keep this game alive by providing some guidance to us so that we can get better.  Voxtex is right in one thing: it is up to us to take that advice and guidance and to suck it up and put the time into getting our asses beat around a map a few hundred times.  Sometimes that's not fun and can be frustrating and hard to deal with but its the only way.  No one can do it for us.  <br>
<br>
I don't know which clans you were thinking of when you started this thread but if there was did you even ask them about joining?  In any case right now it really does not matter.  The 5 pages of stupidity above as Phantom so aptly put it doesn't mean shit.  It would probablly never have reached 5 pages if you just ignored them, let them post their points and move on.  You don't care what they think nor should you.  Do what you want to do.  Build yourself another team, play, learn, have fun.  Nevermind this BS and focus your energy into what is going to make you happy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Wow this is really off topic but whatever....<br>
<br>
I kiss no ones ass, never have and never will.  I will stand up for what I believe is right.  In fact many of the changes you are seeing in CAL right now are because I and others disagreed with our GM.  I have disagreed with him in private discussions as well.  But unlike so many of you that have come to the conclusion that Fearsome is a self interested and corrupt admin, I have at least talked to him and the evidence I see in those discussions indicates a different reality.  If he really was corrupt, your situation probably would have ended differently.<br>
<br>
Yes I do tend to try and stay neutral in many situations because I understand that there can be 2 sides to any story and neither is necessarily 100 % right.  When I see proof of it being one way or the other then I will take a position.  Until then I will remain neutral.  I am a scientist that is how we are trained: to keep an open mind, and to look at the evidence before coming to a conclusion.  I would be a bad admin if I operated any differently.<br>
<br>
I also believe that reasonable adults can disagree without becoming total asses and without having to stop talking to one another.  Unfortunatly too often people take things too personally and things break down.  I prefer not to lose more friends over a damn game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Low Budget Clan is actively seeking new members for CAL's next 4v4 King Season. We wish to recruit and keep together a small band of brothers, if you will. Although we have high expectations in skill, we also require that you have a good attitude towards the game, the team, and teamwork. Doesn't matter if you have god-like aim. If you're as quiet as a ghost, you will not be allowed to play for us in anything else other than friendly scrims and PUGs. Bitches not need apply either.<br>
<br>
Our forums are kept private to our members, Ko-Tao, and WT only.<br>
<br>
Current Roster:<br>
- Charles<br>
- player/chang<br>
- Tuna_Can<br>
- Con<br>
- Scar<br>
- Noypi/Ang<br>
- Sadistical<br>
<br>
However, some members are inactive at the moment and we would like a solid roster to be prepared for next season. King_air and king_mario aren't cakewalk maps. We expect you to know basic jump pad routes, strategies, and other things before we can train you to be a part of LBC.<br>
<br>
If interested, please PM me.<br>
<br>
P.S.: We are also making a clan video. We hope to surpass the quality and metagame skill seen in EFFKULT's recent, magnificent video.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi as asked by many, we at wЯw^ are back for some action.  We will be in Cal and we scrim/pub almost daily During the week and have some late night on the weekends.<br>
We are a friendly group that is always willing to help the new players.  We need one or two more starters for the main 4v4 team.  We are also open to the idea of having a second team, which i think is possible with the amount of clanless players interested in Competitive play.  <br>
<br>
Also looking for a team/clan to scrim with during the week as we use to scrim [TMx] every monday.<br>
<br>
catch me on steam - ninojman <br>

	<div class="content">as most of you know wrw combined forces with EE for s5, but i'd like to put together another group of players for 4v4,  All we ask is you be as active as possible, if you are with another team that is not in cal 4v4 and you just want to play in cal for 1 season just let me know up front that you will not be back after the season and will do your own thing with your own team.  exp is the key.<br>
<br>
WE have a few now, could use 2 to 3 starters and 1 or 2 back-ups and we can join cal-4v4<br>
<br>
I'll manage everything and have server/vent provided <br>
<br>
again if you looking to win cal it likely will not happen with this team, but this team will have fun over the course of the season.  <br>
<br>

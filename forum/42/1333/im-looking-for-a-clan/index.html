	<div class="content">well... being a clan whore myself, I'd advise that you don't actually just see if people are recruiting and hope that you can make it in that clan, if you intend to do that... at least make sure you play with them a bit before hand. make sure they're the right clan, I know again... I am a clan whore and you probably think you shouldn't take that advise, but maybe you should think about it if you weren't planning on it already, I was just throwin' that out there just in case <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> gl though man</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote><div><cite>cyber_clash wrote:</cite>Are you looking for a "fun pub-oriented" clan or a competitive clan?</div></blockquote>
How about this? I'm looking for a group of competitive players who like to screw around in pubs. Active in CAL? Yes. Members who like to casually 1v1? Hell yes. If it's a small clan, I'd like the members to be around my skill level (semipro), but if it's a large clan I don't really care as long as some of the members can at least put up a fight. But mainly I just want a clan with guys on every night that I can hang out and frag with.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I would just like to mention that when TG started with MF he was well aware we were just starting to form a team so we COULD be more competitive, obviously this wasn't going to happen overnight plus the cal season had already started.. <br>
<br>
We are all sad to see TG go, specially so suddendly, I personally like his drive and that is why I started talking to him about becoming MF to begin with, we needed more drive. We had our first OFFICIAL clan match, to test how we work as a team, overall we were starting to go in the right direction, practicing more and getting into more scrims, hopefully the next clan TG joins will be exactly what he wants in the meantime MF will still try to move forward with the plan.<br>
<br>
Good luck TG!<br>

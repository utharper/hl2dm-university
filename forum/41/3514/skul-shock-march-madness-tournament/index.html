I've stated this before, and it becomes more apparent every time you quote me and post.  You have a reading comprehension problem, zman.  I'm completely serious too.<br>
I didn't say is was wrong.  I said it was funny.  It would be like ewR entering the KAT Clan Twin Towers Low Grav No RPG No Nades Open, not telling any other teams, then bouncing in here, bragging about beating up the 'tards and taking 1st place.  It's a Special Olympics win.  Wrong?  Nah.  Lulzworthy?  Oh, fuck yeah.<br>

I wonder who did that...hmm...
<blockquote><div><cite>Fearsome* wrote:</cite>Shell Shock is the opposite of competition. If your new to the game you should just play for a bit and get a feel for the game before you make a rule about no spawn killing but pick a mod that encourages it buy making almost all weapons 1 hit kill. That and the fact there are pretty much no clans that do any sort of league play who play shell shock which is probably why you are asking for some. Shell shock lags a servers to all get out another thing that is terrible for league play. It discourages aggressive play and rewards people for camping due to the noob friendly weapon damage. I will pass.</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Seriously though it was the responsibility of the people running the league to advertise it, not the participants and yea we werent very kind to them, myself included.  I still feel that the presence of all of these different mods has split this game too much.  Skul shock is a noobed down version of the game.

	<div class="content">This was the euro clan scene at it highest.. lots of good players, lots of clans.<br>
<br>
Nerv-Mchaggis was admin for the cup and promoted it very well.<br>
<br>
PIC was always going to win it, but there were a lot of good games on the way. <br>
Tthe final had a bit of controversy. PIC home map was LD  (in which they were at the time practically invincible) and took the win, H2 took Overwatch as their home map, but after holding the roof the RPG stopped spawning, effectively changing the game.<br>
<br>
Clanbase died on its arse as far as HL2DM was concerned soon after,</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

the only reason they used promod (it was used in STA for a while too) was because at the time it offered basic features like spectate and something similar to mp_restartgame, both of which weren't in the game at the time. obviously that's a lot easier just using that than the old everyone switch teams and don't move, but because we have those features now promod is pretty much useless</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It is not useless at all.<br>
Has many features thats hl2dm still lacks.<br>
Reasons to use pro<br>
1 It crashes less<br>
2 It saves your score if you do crash<br>
3 auto screenshots plus the screenie will have steam id<br>
4 no need for mani as everything is voteable from map change to server cfg's to time limits.<br>
5 Change crosshairs and colour easy<br>
6 change your fov to a max of 120<br>
and more<br>

Lol, are you really challenging someone who basically quti hl2?  Somehow you knew who he was just by his forum name, and you brought up the fact that pro lacks hit reg or something, have you ever played lib?.....  The only gripe I've ever had with promods hit reg was when people felt the need to convert hl2dm to hldm.  The source engine doesn't like people doing 1000 vel, never has, never will.  The fact that you all made promod to "fix bugs/quirks in hl2dm" is becoming invalid as of late.  The mod will never get off it's feet again because all the critical bugs that pro used to address have been fixed.  Now all the "l33t" promoders think they hold a candle to tried and true hl2dm'ers because they've spent the past year getting used to how to hit someone moving at 1000 velocity.  If hl2dm wasn't enough for you, that's fine, but don't sit over there and challenge us to games on your mod after we pointed out that your mod is dead.  After having said all this, I'm sure lib wouldn't have much trouble with you, regardless of the mod, but if you really want, come back to regular dm and see why we make people quti hl2dm all together... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Way to represent $W to all the people coming here to learn. Promod has alot more to offer then just "bugfixes", but this is a site about hl2dm, so I'll leave that.<br>

.Conflict posted something along the lines of: "Be nice to see you guys post something besides failed self promo". I responded in the same rude fashion. If he got all butthurt, he could have responded himself. LOL @ the rest of the shit you posted.<br>

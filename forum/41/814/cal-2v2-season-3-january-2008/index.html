Yeah IMO we did really well on biohazard, having such a score with that ping was good enough for us, but we lacked a lot on amplitude...we just didn't know the map ( had no place to play it, neither we ever cared to practice it ), and there you see the difference =/<br>
Great game ^^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">there's actually benefits for having such high ping... every time i go to euro servers where i ping 150+ my magnum suddenly becomes a deadly weapon.. everything i fire counts as a headshot... if you practiced enough on it, you can get used to some of the other "disadvantages"... another benefit of having high ping is you become less hitable and explosives do less damage to you... we noticed this a lot in the amplitude match against these guys.. we would shoot them with direct rockets, but instead of dying, it just enabled their jetpacks and they went flying out of the room to safety at 2000 vel... D: gravity gun becomes hard to use though.. but that's hardly a disadvantage on some maps that have hardly any physics at all... like aim arena or lostvillage.. but yeah LSD is a good clan struggling with high ping....would be interesting to see how a mutually low ping match played... anyways, gg's guys, good luck this season as well..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

High ping is just a way of life. It's really tough when you're a vagabond and you have to scrim with 20 ping, 70 ping, 100 ping, and 150 in the span of a week.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yes constantly changing your ping is tough... but if you're used to a certain ping, whether high or low, you can find consistent ways to do damage... and i've found that high ping offers a few advantages that low ping does not..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

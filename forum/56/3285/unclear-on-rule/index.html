Also, I know this isn't in the rules, but since Killboxes are bland, we've always had a rule in our non CAL matches that combines be white.  Is this a possiblity?  Or is it something to keep in mind for next season?<br>

	<div class="content">5.80 Connectivity Issues<br>
<br>
    CAL is not responsible for players who experience connectivity problems. Teams should have backup players ready to join if a player gets disconnected or lags out.<br>
<br>
    If a player drops from play during the process of a match going live (live on three), the match is to be stalled until such player returns at which point the match is restarted. <strong class="text-strong">Likewise, if a player lags out within the first minute of play, the match is to be restarted.</strong><br>
<br>
    If proof of malicious activity against a server or individual is provided post-match and is deemed conclusive or otherwise acceptable by league officials, the replay of a match or portions of a match may be requested. Such evidence needs to be made available as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
    Players that drop from the server but return must be sure to restart their demos and retake their screenshots as soon as they reenter the server. No additional screenshot round is required for them; they are to take them on their own.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
If a team mate lags out after the first minute the match continues.  You either need another player on stand by ready to jump in or hope your teammate can get back in quickly.  The real bitch is when they time out but the server doesn't realize it just yet so they continue to spawn for the next minute.  When this happens you often see the other teammate trying to protect the person until they can rejoin.  I would be curious on the legality of just rcon kicking them if they have clearly timed out but the server is still spawning them as I have been in at least one match that was won by 2 points but 5-6 points were made by killing a person who timed out.<br>
<br>
I can see how on some of the maps a black combine might be difficult to see.  That said, each team gets a chance to be combine so each team gets a chance to "hide" in the shadows a little.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi and sorry I didn't reply faster to this but looks like we have a good team answering stuff...  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
I broke my leg and my mobility has been shot, as is we are in need of a second killbox person, I think Bucky would make a great Cal admin, are you still interested? If not anyone else? Poor Para has to do my duties for the weekend.... while I wait for the hard cast to be put on my foot [had surgery so no hard cast until Tuesday when staples come out  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":x" title="Mad"> ] <br>
<br>
Anyways good job, I hope keeper you got your answers... I am not clear as to how you cant distinguished combine V rebel...  like Chem said they have their own built in "here I come" jingle... but perhaps you could ask nicely of your competition to switch to white combine and you return the favor, but that would be up to individual teams <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

	<div class="content">I want to note something about maps. <br>
One of the maps on the list is a perfect example for a map that is anything but a competitive map; the dm_killsphere.<br>
Even though its really a beautiful map I donâ€™t see how such an enormous map can be played other than on a 32 server pub. let alone a competition.<br>
<br>
So please, everyone, proposing maps to the list please bare in mind...we need a mid to large sized boxes. Not a universe. And keep minding FPS. Killsphere has a very low FPS from any point in the map. Its unplayable in a competition.<br>
<br>
The maps as they change will rotate on my server as note before so anyone can come in and have a taste.  ip: 8.2.120.232:27015<br>

You never asked for my clans name. Its Elite and its in my avatar lol. We dont have killboxes in our rotation because we dont need them in the rotation. If we wanna play killbox maps we just go to kbh or tsgk servers. If those servers dried up then we would add killboxes to our rotation. I dont think having a server with killboxes in the rotation is a prerequisite for being in this kb league, so Ive just been a bit confused at your questions.

Keep in mind that for CAL you can only use an altered map if you have permission from the original map author to make the alteration.  This rule has eliminated several maps from being used in stock CAL.  Either maps have glitches or problems that make them unusable in CAL as is but because permission to make the alteration could not be had the maps could not be used.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'll tell you. We weren't prepared. We kept chaning servers, then I think the server admin who's server we were on left. It just turned into a pub so everyone was like if we are here to pub, we'll go do something else. We didn't agree on the voted maps because lots of them people have never heard of. We need to do another picking process to find maps that everyone likes, has played, and knows well enough. We don't think the vote in this thread was fair because we can't be sure that people that had no intent on playing in this league voted. Also, most people didnt get to vote in this thread and they were also complaining about that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, as far as being prepared some things happened in the last 2 days I could not have foreseen, the committee is suppose to help with preparations as well, setting up the maps that were voted for in your server, specially if you had issues with them, would have been the way to go. Some of the maps are newer and not knows as well, for example I did not know a couple of maps until someone suggested it at the committee the first couple of times, does not make them bad maps. I didn't know the name of a couple of maps that I have played several times, when I saw them was like "oh,yeah this one"<br>
<br>
A lot of the maps CAN'T be because of hidden rooms, tunnels or other problems for example I love bunker box, I play bunker several times a day, it is very zen for me BUT bunker box has a flaw and that is the tunnels where you can hide for the length of the game after getting a few kills and win your match, so bunker box as much as I love it can't be on the list, as popular as it is can't be on the list.<br>
<br>
You guys are also use to long battles and long periods of time, Tazzer asked me how many frags and time, I said time only 20 minutes <em class="text-italics"> is all you get, you have to maximize that time if your map is too big, your weapons too far you waste time collecting stuff and looking for your opponent. <br>
<br>
This is what doing a new vote will be like, get a maps list together, the more maps the less time you have to decide, the maps list has to be reviewed, a lot of maps will not make it in. Then you have to put up a vote, if you don't then you guys are making a sole decision, which is something I personally was trying to avoid, I think people getting involved is a great thing, maybe they weren't interested before but now they feel like they had a say. You have to have your vote for several days, the maps voted in would be it, must be at least ten we need 8. So we would be behind basically another week, time need to practice maps you may not be acquainted with is lost.<br>
<br>
Here are your guidelines for maps, they can't be huge, they can't be too colorful, they can't be to busy or glitchy, they can't have a crashing problem when too many explosives go off, preferably no hiding spots, broken lifts, secret walls or tunnels.  Remember this season you have 1 and 2 player competition, so you should be able to see your opponent easy enough or else you will never find each other, open basic killboxes are best. If this voting doesn't get in by Friday, the 10 originally voted for maps stand, that's final we can't loose anymore time. the would mean rosters will not open until NEXT week.</em></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Why even have a vote if you arent going to put the top maps in the league? If it's because there's already 2 tsgk maps in the list, then that is bs. They are the best 3 kb maps out there along with kbh2. Nothing else is remotely close.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah that list was put up last minute, I kinda messed it, but the final vote still visible, is quite clear that there were 10 maps voted for, maps that were suggested on the original forum, maps that were suggested to me by people and fit the guidelines. If having too many groups from one clan is issue one way, it can be issue another way, perhaps we should put a cap on how many maps ONE clan or map maker can have? but right there is exactly what I was hoping to avoid.. 1001 rules, but perhaps there is a reason all those rules are necessary, so it doesn't become a one clan or one person show.<br>

My thought is we voted, the vote was up for almost two weeks, I offered to review maps if people uploaded them, no one did. some suggestions were not feasible due to size, if you never heard of some of them for gods sake, go look at them, download them, if you find fault or a reason why it should not have been up, say so.<br>
<br>
I am committed to this process to keep the nature of fairness and as much as it has pained me, I quti Max, I am stepping down from MF as clan leader and Team Veracity will not be participating in this league. My only interest is for this community to rejuvenate itself by creating more competition, new faces, new blood.. etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Which 5 maps? care to elaborate which maps were ok with your side committee? Who is selecting these maps, that you didn't answer and why? Is there is going to be a vote and revision of these maps or should we just take your word for it?<br>

Really? NO, you play 2 maps in pre then you start the season, one week, one map. Do you know right away all spawn points, all weapon locations, best spots to snipe off, well then are either an incredibly good fighter or you are a non organized fighter, whatever works and probably why you are picking maps you already know.</span></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Pomp's original vote on maps had enough responses to move forward.  The first I heard of the maps needing to change is when you two started bickering publicly a couple of days ago.  No one ever mentioned to me (as one of the committee members) the desire to change maps from these.<br>

I agree with Taz though... a few of the maps strike me as strange choices (that were probably influence by the ultra low grav crowd).  But that is not unprecedented.  Regular CAL has at times included maps that were not well known or were not popular.  Dominator may be a bit big for a 1v1 and I have not seen scotish memorial to judge it at all.  I would have liked to have seen Ultra in the list as I like it.  However, in the end the most important thing is that we get the first season rolling.  Again, it is not unprecedented that a map get changed mid season.  Normally this happens due to a glitch being found but I am sure that since this is the first season I am sure we could potentially change a map simply because it was an exceeedingly unpopular choice made by a committee that couldn't get its collective shit together fast enough to make good choices.<br>
<br>
So with that said I would like to see you two agree that the petty little stuff was stupid and then kiss and make up (just don't let Wildthing know).  Tazzer I really would like to see you both as admins, both continuing to have input, and both working together to make this a reality.  If you still feel so strongly as to drop out as admin then let me know and I will talk to Fearsome about taking on the role myself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Pomp's original vote on maps had enough responses to move forward.  The first I heard of the maps needing to change is when you two started bickering publicly a couple of days ago.  No one ever mentioned to me (as one of the committee members) the desire to change maps from these.<br>

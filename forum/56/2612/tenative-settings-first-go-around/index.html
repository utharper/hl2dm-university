	<div class="content">While I will admit that coming from mostly playing in servers that are grav 375ish and everything else stock these settings are different but from a movement perspective it didn't take me that long to adapt to these settings.<br>
<br>
But as Punk said in another thread these settings allow for some pretty crazy velocities (easy 600+ on ground and 1200+ in air with simple strafe jumps plus a little air control).<br>
<br>
After play testing these settings for a couple days now I feel pretty safe in saying that your typically KBH (or similar server) player will find themselves at a significant disadvantage when it comes to aiming over anyone who is used to these sorts of velocities.  My own guess is that these velocities will make prediction weapons (xbow) unappealing.  You are unlikely to get those beautifully timed xbow shots like you do currently in KBH (or similar servers).  Instead it will be all hitscan and even then landing solid shots with the mag for those not used to these velocities will be difficult.  Getting in close with the shotty or unloading a clip (or two) from the ar2 will be the order of the day for those LG KB players who only play grav 375 and everything else stock.<br>
<br>
The real problem is that even within the LG KB community there are quite a few different styles of play and picking something that will satisfy all (or even most) of the people is difficult.  This is an issue stock players and leagues never had to tackle.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah I'm not quite sure where the need for these settings came from. I spent about 1 hour and I went to every killbox server in the US(and a few outside the US) that I could find(about 25), I logged all the settings and heres what I found:<br>
The majority of killbox servers use standard accelerate, air accelerate and friction however most use a lower gravity than 350. Coincidentally the only servers (that see more than just a few players a day) I found running higher accelerate, airaccelerate and friction were EYE and MAX, go figure. By looking at server stats you can easily see that KBH and TSGK servers have a dominating amount of the player base, and you would think this league would want to be based on what is most popular.However if this is a compromise to balance out the higher gravity then I suppose I would rather have the higher gravity than lower accelerate, air accelerate and friction, but it still dosen't make alot of sense to me. <br>
<br>
I think this will backfire though so there will be such a thing as school of hard knocks, and sometimes that's the only way some people can figure things out. Looking at who is signed up so far I can tell there's gonna be two classes of players:<br>
those who will be moving at warp speed and those who will be moving at a slow to moderate speed.<br>
<br>
Aside from the speed issue, in playing with some players who can move last night at these settings, what you are going to see is that the players who get hurt are going to be able to get to HP and armor very quickly (especially if maps that are heavily laden with hp and armor make it in) and it will be very hard for some people to get kills. That is unless they have the magic mag  headshot ability on players moving 700+ ups.<br>
<br>
The last major problem with these settings is it more or less takes several weapons right out of the game. The xbow is useless, the mag is very hard to land shots with, orbs become only random kills and what you have left is the ar and shotgun.<br>
<br>
Im thinking that once the maps are selected it might be prudent for those on the committee to actually play test with these settings with some of the better movers in a actual 1v1 or 2v2, and make sure this is what they want.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What I am saying is that these settings cater to a very specific style of LG KB play.  Those not used to this style of play (e.g. those who mainly stick to KBH and TSGK servers) will find themselves at a significant disadvantage and will end up resorting to "spray and pray" tactics.

I don't know that I would be calling it a disadvantage for KBH or TSGK players if they are the type of players that can move at 500 ups in standard grav and settings, as they will be extremely fast and much harder to hit. I do think it would be a disadvantage to the ultra low grav players who are used to limited movement and floating around not to mention game play will be rather limited.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I do think it would be a disadvantage to the ultra low grav players who are used to limited movement and floating around not to mention game play will be rather limited.</div></blockquote>

I do agree that anyone who has strong movement in standard grav is likely to be very difficult to hit under these settings.  That wasn't really my point.  I don't think your typically KBH/TSGK player is sustaining 500 velocity in standard grav.  By way of example, I see Tazzer as your typically KBH/TSGK player (I use Taz because I have played against him a bunch, hope you don't mind Taz).  Taz has pretty good aim with the mag, is intelligent about playing in the box, and his movement is adequate (better than average) for play in under KBH/TSGK.  But I doubt that Taz could sustain 400+, let alone 500+, in standard grav.  He doesn't need to in KBH/TSGK to be effective (though it certainly would help).  Under these settings I would anticipate that Taz will see a slight increase in his speed (let's say high 400s on the ground) while players used to these settings will be flying by at 700.  If your numbers are correct on the largest segment of LG KB players being KBH/TSGK players then I don't think that these settings cater to the typical LG KB player.<br>
<br>
I think we (you and I) largely agree that these settings are a little out of whack... we are just seeing different possibilities from these settings.<br>
<br>
I do agree with you that those used to 150 grav and stock otherwise will suffer the most here... not only will they not be able to hit those that are moving by at 700 but they will be sitting ducks because they are not used to any form of advanced movement.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Because it takes more timing to him them, by the time you see them and throw they are already gone.

Anyway as, tazzer said, we will finalize stuff this weekend, one of the topics we will be re-discussing will be the settings, do not want to discourage anyone from playing that includes the low grav players, remember we are trying to get new blood into Cal. Also, please consider that first season will be kinda funky, we will be finding our style and things will pop up that we never imagine. If we can stick together to make the first season a success, we then will have a little more to go on for our second season, fix any problems that we may have.<br>
<br>
So PLEASE bear with us, don't bail unless you have at least given it 1 season, its a process, we are not perfect, we will make mistakes and we can't please everyone buy we ARE trying.<br>

Here is my prediction...<br>
<br>
If the settings are left the way they are then the people used to playing KBH and TSGK servers will play 1 or 2 league matches (mostly likely the preseason matches) before they bail on the league.  Most leagues already have enough problems with retention due to people getting owned and it ceasing to be fun for them.  We do not need another barrier.<br>
<br>
I think Keeper is just voicing now what will happen to most others once league play actually starts.<br>
<br>
I find it interesting that over in the map vote thread that the KBH and TSGK maps lead all other maps in some cases by a 3:1 margin and in almost all cases a 2:1 margin.  Could this be an indication that people are most comfortable with KBH and TSGK and their settings?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Of course it is the reason, server stats don't lie.<br>

Indeed!<br>
<br>
It even gives some advantage to both players.  You can still land a decent mag shot on a person that is in air since they haven't built up the velocity on the ground that allows them to fly around all crazy.  However, several times after hitting Punk with the first mag shot it caused him to zip around in the air (the mag causing him an increase in velocity) and made a second shot much more difficult.<br>
<br>
This strikes a nice balance.  Let's face it... if you stall in air or simply don't move around much you should expect to get shot at least once in a killbox but the increase in velocity from the shot helps you avoid the second shot.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was a little curious about that as well.  I thought initially that he may be refering to the fact that yahoo does not run their mail under secure socket layer (ssl) by default.  For years the default yahoo login did not even use ssl though that changed a year or two ago.  But I just checked and Google doesn't run gmail under ssl by default either.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think it does have to do with karma somewhat. Tazz has always been really cool to everyone in game and overall comes off as a good person. There are some people in this community who are the exact opposite and I highly doubt you would see people stepping up to help them out, thats the karma part.

I think it does have to do with karma somewhat. Tazz has always been really cool to everyone in game and overall comes off as a good person. There are some people in this community who are the exact opposite and I highly doubt you would see people stepping up to help them out, thats the karma part. What goes around does indeed come back around.</div></blockquote>

that's a good point.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
work: my buddy who lives close by just called and said he finally picked up <br>
several jobs for he and i and god what a relief but this is doing replacement windows<br>

maybe just maybe we can get back to at least even keel.<br>
<br>
i have a very good feeling that you guys and gals have been praying for us alot<br>
cause things are happening........i am so very thankful for all you have done.<br>
<br>
p.s. i may sound like a broken record with the thanks but you all deserve it to no<br>

A word about Karma from someone who's been in very tough spots in life. it all boils down to YOUR state of mind and the way you carry yourself around those closest to you.<br>
Always see a FUTURE mental image of yourself in a good state without the problems and without going into specifics or presumptions. This may sound bs to some but bs or not it sure PUTS your mind in a positive direction and you start moving forward again. It's a chemical process and it's very powerful. Karma or not - if one is SET on something there is hardly anything or anyone who can stop him.<br>
<br>
we can open a new debate about Karma. but now...i think we're hijacking the CAL KB League 1v1 thread; a league that's been hijacked since day one (talk about Karma) <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Truth is you should never do anything expecting a good return from Karma, however it has been my experience than we I try do to the right thing, I seem to get good stuff back and well, how could you not?<br>
<br>
Truth again is I am absolutely busted and until today couldn't pay my own utilities, but karma smiled on me recently with a special someone <em class="text-italics">[ty Chop.. it's kinda his $20 bucks lol]</em> and even I would like to keep the good stuff coming, I feel so incredibly blessed right now and I am happy to help Tazz <em class="text-italics">[even if I got bitchy at him, I never wished anything bad for him]</em> he has been a very cool guy and the community loves him, this is a HUGE demonstration of that, we all got together and started the ball rolling for him again... who would have thunk!!!</span></div>

	<div class="content">I am trying to slow you down?   Hardly.  Where do you get that?  I have been busy trying to get something together for stock.  I dont have time to deal with killbox, thats why I got you and Panic involved in the first place because I know I cant do it all by myself.  Panic is involved because he is motivated to do something and see it happen, not just talk about it.  I thought about trying to build a whole web interface right now, but its gona take too damn long.  IMO, we need to get this going now, that is, if the game isnt too dead already and it isnt too late.<br>
<br>
I have not said much to you because I didnt want to seem I was pushing you too much.  I gave you mod on the forums when you said you were having a hard time getting them set up. How is that holding you up?   Yea I dont play killbox, but I would to see it included in the interest of being comprehensive and not exclusionary.  On the contrary, I would like to see SOMETHING happen.   You seem to be doing absolutely nothing, you havent even spoken to me about it whatsoever unless I ask how it is going and even then no details at all.   <br>
<br>
This can be run from a forums, you dont need a whole website to do this, just get people to sign up on the forums and DO it.  Its been 3 weeks and no movement whatsoever so you are the one holding it up, not me.  I gave you the means to do it, but you are doing nothing.   Panic spoke to me because he was frustrated that there was apparently nothing happening.  He said YOU were talking about dropping it and asked if he could get some sign ups.  He seems motivated to see something happen so if he wanted to do it why not?  Maybe you should let him help you instead of doing everything yourself?  That is IF you really do want to do it?<br>
<br>
And I see you removed me from friends....are you serious?   Wow how 'adult' of you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
lol @ discussing it privately after not giving me the courtesy to let me know you were going to do this.<br>
<br>
My week last week:<br>
<br>
Fri- Hospital- routine takes all morning.<br>
Sund- Emergency room at hospital- reaction to medication, hands, arms, neck, shoulders and face very swollen. takes all day, they can't figure out why.<br>
mon- visit to my regular Md, wants to see if he cant figure out what happen because ER couldn't, more blood test and 2 sets of xrays, takes all day.<br>
Thursday- Intravenous treatment for ms, takes 4-5 hours, with 1 hr wait after making sure I don't drop dead.<br>
<br>
Not asking for pity, perhaps a little understanding, sometimes things happen that slow people down and when you sat I am doing nothing, the conversation about the killbox tournament would reflect the opposite, was setting up my admins, was lining up places to have the matches, waiting on the website which would be more effective than just signing up at the U where very few people play non-stock and we would have to fight off the usual bs.<br>
<br>
YOU got me involved? I was happy that you showed me about the killbox idea and was supportive but seemed like your idea was flat in the water until I put my suggestion in, you IM every time you saw something you did not like, I dreaded looking at them, you tried to "lure" me into different directions and questioned every move, I have to remind you, you are not the boss of hl2dm.<br>
<br>
Just because YOU didn't see what I was doing, doesn't mean it wasn't happening, I chose not to get you involved any further, I saw no need since you kept reminding me that you were making the league blah blah blah<br>
<br>
I also had a few reasons for not starting right away, did not want to disturb Warzone, did not want 100 kids who were off for the summer, etc.<br>
<br>
At the end, regardless, it would have been nice to be at least TOLD you were doing this, giving me a chance either to show my stuff or GTFO. This was hostile, you can sugar coat it all you want, there was no need for this, I believe you felt that would steal your thunder, which is actually kind of sad.<br>
<br>
<br>
NOW... we can be done with this conversation</span></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

</div></blockquote>
 <br>
Yes, dear, I asked you to be involved because I thought you were interested in doing it.  You suggested a FFA tourny, which if thats what you felt the KB ppl wanted then I was all for it.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Shinigami wrote:</cite>

Errm huh?  Dilusional much?  What kind of drugs are you on?  Seriously, you should know me better than that.   I didnt see anything going on.  That is why I IMed you; to see what was happening and to see if you needed anything.  Talk? Most of the time you basically told me nothing.  Nothing about what you were doing and nothing regarding your RL issues.  Thats all the more reason you should have people helping you and not doing it all yourself. Sorry about your health issues Pomp, I really am, but again you never said anything about the extent of it.   Im not clairvoyant you know.  <br>
<br>
Also I never tried to "lure" you into anything, I dont do that kind of thing. You told me in the first place that you couldnt get a forums and I gave you access to the ones I had because of the very reasons you mention about not doing it here on these forums.   The only thing I questioned was the need for a whole website for a simple tourny because I know it takes time to do that.  I felt we needed to get something going as soon as we could, not dick around for a month getting a whole website working.   We ran a 2v2 tourny right here and it worked fine.  <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Shinigami wrote:</cite>

Never said I was.  Just trying to do something positive.<br>

  This was supposed to be a team effort, Pomp with a lot of people involved, not just you.   Being a team is a 2 way street and it takes communication.  If you dont communicate, how the hell does anything come across? <br>

 <blockquote><div><cite>shinigami wrote:</cite>This was hostile, you can sugar coat it all you want, there was no need for this, I believe you felt that would steal your thunder, which is actually kind of sad. </div></blockquote>
  <br>
Yeah, right whatever you want to believe.  Anyway, I can see that you cant be rational about it and your version of the facts are a bit fictional.  <br>
<br>
Whatever Pomp, get defensive, get bitter, hold a grudge and twist your side of things, believe that the whole world is against you so you feel justified.  Whatever makes you feel better about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

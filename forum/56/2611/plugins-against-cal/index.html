That's probably the primary reason why they don't allow them.  It eliminates the ability for anybody to give a person/team an advantage.<br>

The other things would be lag, hit reg, performance issues and stability.  But those would be related more to mani than any plugin written specifically for league play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
It is <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">NOT</span></strong> a General Cal rule for all games.    It is a rule adopted by Fearsome for the hl2dm divisions.

It's not a biggie, but it would be nice if you know that whatever you type as team_say can't be read by your opponent via HLSW. More than this, though, I'm curious if it would be technically possible to do via a plugin.<br>

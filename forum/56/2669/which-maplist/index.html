that should be the list: list B doesnt even have kbh_2 in it nore domebox, so lets merge them to make a good list. Lets dont make this no harder than it should be, the killbox players know what they want familiar killboxs(not euroboxs) we never play.  Not to down the euro community none at all. <br>
<br>
Was hard enough on the setting decision which i think some should be taken down to stock. One being sv_accerlerate, friction back to normal just because ive been testing these settings and it seems to effect the hitboxs (dont ask me how) it just does. <br>

umm hello??? i dont wont to go head to head with a maps list that just silly.<br>
this was asked of me to do so i tried to do just that its not about <br>
what "i" want or about what "you" want!! its the people that asked me to do!!<br>
you criticize "me" perssonally over and over when im doing what the community<br>
asked of me on all calls!!<br>
why are you doing this?<br>
i came to you and fearsome with the players wants?? did that anger you?<br>
because that was not my intent at all.<br>
<br>
so you can just stop with the vote on a map list.<br>
its pointless i wouldnt pick the list i put up over the other one thats silly.<br>
just adding to the list of maybes is all. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

	<div class="content">well if nobody noticed ive been workign to much to test these settings, last night i came to the conclusion if somebodys cmd rate is 100 you cant kill them(with these rates) tho at 600 it isnt a problem. somehow the friction and the  accelrate mess's with it, not the airaccell but just accelerate<br>

<br>
idk but thats my opinion</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Ending the stupid argument the following way, we need 10 maps. I am not touching the ones already voted in but instead I am going to start a new vote for all the late maps suggested and then you can pick two, let the people decide, the right people.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"><span style="color:#000000">Ok, so we are starting to talk about what the standards should be, somewhere between 100 which is about the lowest some Low grav clans use to 500, since standard gravity is 600. feel free to discuss what settings your clan uses and what the benefits are, what maps are most popular and why, etc. Please input ONLY from low grav/killbox players, we need to keep the discussion flowing.<br>

When I have my comcast figured out, probably Monday, I will start spamming and get more people in here.

^That<br>
<br>
Each team chooses 1 home map + the settings for that map pre-season. Then every week they get to play on THEIR server with THEIR map, and the same for their opponent. NO highest score at the end of two rounds to determine the  winner. No tiebreakers. Will result in a lot of ties, but who cares? Everyone has fun playing on their own turf, and when someone wins it actually means something. <br>

What you guys are trying to do is create stock settings for killbox. Not gonna happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

{MaX} is an exclusively low gravity clan, with sv_gravity set at 100. For obvious reasons this setting is far too low, so I'd vote for a setting at around 300 to 350. If the gravity is going to be low, it has to be low enough to be in the true spirit of low gravity, that being less emphasis on things like bunny hopping and more emphasis on floating around in the air really fast.<br>
<br>
Also, low gravity is significantly less fun and more frustrating with a low sv_airaccelerate setting. {MaX} uses a very high setting of 500, which I think would be optimal because it allows for the most air maneuverability.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Fearsome does not dismiss people out of hand, he will however pick people he feels he knows well enough to do the job.  He is very cautious about people he doesnt know that well.  Thats being careful in who you work with and as GM it is his perogative.  This isnt the playground.<br>

As I said before, dont shoot the messenger; there is no need to get defensive, it is not my job to decide who is or isnt qualified, I am only passing along the message that I was given.   You will have to ask Fearsome why he felt I would be a good admin.  Its not a position I sought, he found me and chose to ask me to become one.   I can only guess that its because had player for a long time, and wasnt planning on going anywhere soon.   I love the game and I am a clan leader of a normal grav/stock map clan.  I was heavily involved in the community and on the DMU where I tried to contribute in the conversations in a positive way and with a level head.  He might have read on the U that I have been through Graduate school (there is a thread somewhere there that asked people to say what schooling they had).  That told him I met the age requirement.  Having been a graduate student himself, he knows it requires someone to be organized as well as a responsible worker (ie not a slacker) to get everything you have to get done accomplished and you need to have the ability to work somewhat independently.  Finally I was looking to get more involved in the community through the U, but I was not aware of the need for admins or who did that job.    All in all, I think I have done a pretty good job so far.<br>
 <br>
<br>
I will also warn anyone that thinks it would be "cool" to be a CAL admin to rethink that perspective. Its work, its a thankless job and it can be very frustrating.  You have to adhere to a schedule.  You have to often stop doing whatever you are doing to answer questions or to go do some of the administrative things you have to do.  People are quick to judge you for everything you do and every decision you make.  People are quick to call you corrupt, even people who know what the job is like.   If you are easily flustered or quick to go on the defensive, you probably wont enjoy it.  Also you cant have the attitude that you are going to come in and be a policeman of CAL and make everybody behave all the time.  Admins on a power trip dont stay admins for long.  If that is what people think this is about (and I am not saying that this is the case), then it might not be the right thing for them to do.  Do it because you love the game and because you want to help keep it going by doing something positive.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, I spoke to fearsome and he said I was the only one that was really trying for the admin thing, so now I am entirely confused as to what Paradox was saying but let's move on...<br>
<br>
Am I bias enough for Cal? What does that mean? Can I do a good job you bet, I am tough but fair where there are rules I enforce them. I have the time and willingness to do this job, there are a lot of very qualified people who do not. I really want this to happen, I think it is time for the low grav/killbox players to get their chance and I am hoping that will increase the cal competitors and will also encourage other styles and mods of trying to get serious by having a Cal division. I am hoping this is good for the GAME overall, I am pro-hl2dm, that's what I am, I like to see the game get out of its downward spiral and start acquiring new players. <br>
<br>
Having said that Fearsome has given me the task to get a committee together to go ahead and set up standards, rules, maps, etc. That's why I need to know who is interested in the committee, which will put together the initial set up but not run it after that, this is good for those that like to see this happen but can't do much maintenance. This need to happen fairly fast for we are going to attempt to have a first run in less than a month. Ideally I like a representative of all the low grav clans to be involved, once I have enough clans that are committed to enter the competition then Fearsome will review it all and if it goes well he will open a roster for this division.<br>
<br>
A lot of good stuff is being discussed here, we are going to have to start having serious conversations away from this forum at some point, once we are finalizing things. <br>
<br>
I am going to start setting up some way for the committee to communicate, that doesn't mean the discussions here are over, so anyone really interested in the committee please e-mail me <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c4f44454f475b4558444d18186c40455a49024f4341"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ceada6a7ada5b9a7baa6affafa8ea2a7b8abe0ada1a3">[email protected]</span></a><br>

1. Gravity/Velocity [Settings]</span><br>
Would we have 1 setting that may affect the mappers settings as we mentioned before or would we do different settings for different maps?<br>
<span style="color:#4080BF">2. Map recommendations </span>for whatever we are doing 1v1, 2v2, 3v3?<br>
 {good ones Paradox} <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>
Ideally the maps we pick should be very basic in the sense that there are no hidden walls, no secret rooms or many transports. The idea is for people to device strategy, even in the craziness of a killbox.<br>
<span style="color:#4080FF">3. 1v1, 2v2, 3v3?</span> For right now Fearsome mention we may just start with one, ideally I like to see 2, sounds like 1v1 would be popular, so maybe 1v1 and 3v3? <br>
Teams should IDEALLY, have as many people in their roster as possible, enrolled as soon as possible just in case, even if you do not get to use a couple of people it helps to have back up to meet your matches.<br>
<span style="color:#4080FF">4. Rules,</span> of course we would follow already established Cal rules for HL2DM with some necessary changes for the style, but the same basic rules will apply. Same protocol as far as signing up, communications, meeting matches, filing disputes, etc.<br>
<br>
I still need volunteers for the committee, so far I am pretty sure I can count on the following:<br>
1. Valar<br>
2. Stell<br>
3. keeper [?]<br>
<br>
It would really help to have the assistance of CAL [600grav division] for general assistance and ideas, so if any of you 600 grav guys want to join, in the true spirit of helping, I am all ears <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

And we'll need a plugin to handle the map changes if you are going to change gravity.  If you change gravity right before the map switches, then it will be right on the next map.  If you do it after the new map loads, then the physobjects will not react right.  It would be a simple thing to do...might even use the plugin they use at CU to work as a base ... if needed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not sure what you mean but again - as far as player's (Client side) settings playing in the league will require none.<br>
All settings will be made either as new versions of those elected maps with their settings embedded / added to the map, independently upon map launch. A one single settings cgf is not a reality.<br>
<br>
Also.. it seems some may not fully understand the idea of server settings - while you set the map's gravity you can also set (when relevant) the sv_accelerate, sv_airaccelerate, sv_friction, sv_maxspeed etc. Even though those cvars are less familiar to players they are still part of the same cvar list we were given with this game to leave as is or modify as we may.<br>
<br>
"Stock" cvars are values you set. obviously they will have to "come" set at "something". but they are still only values and nothing more. FYI the larger majority playing HL2DM uses none-stock server settings. needless to mention most of us hardly ever use their "stock" <strong class="text-strong">client</strong> settings and those are changed in many cases several times a day as key binds to match certain servers' rate and tickrate settings.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

why the need to simplify something that is so simply to do in the first place. i think seriously all this debate about the different settings is (like always) the only thing that's compilcated. map settings can be embedded into the map without any further messing around from the server.cfg, admin, anyone's side.<br>
leave this alone already and let people play the way they want in a tournament they want to participate in for their own enjoyment. enough red tape.<br>
<br>
And in practice :<br>
<br>
Have the server.cfg set to 375 grav and leave the rest pure2.<br>
Map will be remade for CAL (like so many have until now for stock style) with the server cvars triggered by a point_server_command. this is as simple as adding a freaking texture or removing a spawn point.<br>
if a mapper doesn't know how to do it - please let me know and i'l post a link to download a prefab.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes you need to decide on the server settings.  Take a gander at the current 1v1 and team cfgs as a guide.  You can adjust things like gravity, air accel, accel.  Once you agree on what it should be, I would suggest you keep one gravity setting across all maps so that its consistent and thats what people get used to playing.   I also suggest you keep the client range settings the same as the current ones so that those are consistent with the other divisions, because I see that some people will be willing to play both KB and standard divisons.  If you need help with interpreting whats what, please ask.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What I will add is that anything we do needs to be as simple as it is currently in CAL.  You run a single config (either 1v1 or teams), all the settings are configured, all plugins are disabled, you get the nice count down, and then the game starts.  We do not need to have a lot of fiddling with settings before a match can start.<br>
<br>
Now, if these values can be embedded in the maps and are enforced on a mp_restartgame then I think we could potentially use different settings per map.  However I can see a potential for abuse if a mp_restartgame does not enforce the values embedded in the map.  In particular I might change the grav to something slightly higher or lower the accelerate so it more closes matches what I am used to.  It would then be incumbent upon my opponent to both know and check that the map settings had not be adjusted.<br>
<br>
Also, currently in CAL 1v1 each player picks a map from the list of maps and ties are decided on the weekly map.  Will that still be the case for KB CAL 1v1 or will it move to the same system that CAL 2v2 and 4v4 use (weekly map, add the scores from both games, winner is person with highest score, ties allowed)?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When it comes to server settings based on the map there may be some variances in preference but I would think the only thing we really need to worry about is gravity, things like air accelerate, friction, max speed and such do not really need to vary from stock default settings IMO.<br>
<br>
Now I understand that some clans do run modified values of the aforementioned settings and are used to playing that way, but in order to simplify things to some extent wouldn't it make more sense to just only change gravity if it a common value cant be agreed upon?<br>
<br>
After taking a look at the suggested map list so far I can't see why any of the maps wouldn't work fine with a gravity of 375 or 400. I would think it would be of some benefit to again just agree on a common setting, put that setting in the cal cfg and go with a standardized cfg which works for all maps in the league.<br>
<br>
By doing this you are going to eliminate alot of time being wasted setting up the match and verifying settings ect., eliminate potential disputes after the fact, and overall give players a "base" setting to get used to for competitive play.</div></blockquote>

why the need to simplify something that is so simply to do in the first place. i think seriously all this debate about the different settings is (like always) the only thing that's compilcated. map settings can be embedded into the map without any further messing around from the server.cfg, admin, anyone's side.<br>
leave this alone already and let people play the way they want in a tournament they want to participate in for their own enjoyment. enough red tape.<br>
<br>
And in practice :<br>
<br>
Have the server.cfg set to 375 grav and leave the rest pure2.<br>
Map will be remade for CAL (like so many have until now for stock style) with the server cvars triggered by a point_server_command. this is as simple as adding a freaking texture or removing a spawn point.<br>
if a mapper doesn't know how to do it - please let me know and i'l post a link to download a prefab.</div></blockquote>

I guess the big question is Valar are you volunteering to redo all the maps?<br>
Because so far I haven't heard anyone other than keeper say he would modify his map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

These were exactly my thoughts, and coming from previous cal admin experience even though it may seem to some people that all this is not that complicated, you need to keep in mind that some players are not that server savy and as much as possible you need to keep things simple.

having a point_server_command run at MapSpawn overrides everything and any server (cfg / autoexec) settings. it cannot be affected by mp_restartgame or any cvar you run in a match. be it CAL or not. <br>
Again, the settings will apear with the map exactly the same way as any other component in the map.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I guess the big question is Valar are you volunteering to redo all the maps?</div></blockquote>
yes. not a problem at all. If and when this is agreed upon i will contact the different authors for their approval on the modifications.<br>

another topic we should discuss is A and B levels. i'm seeing a well number of high level players coming in and this is super great but this is also going to be pwnage simply put. doing A and B level will be a lot more satisfying to many many people and will allow them to take part and enjoy playing some DM. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

another topic we should discuss is A and B levels. i'm seeing a well number of high level players coming in and this is super great but this is also going to be pwnage simply put. doing A and B level will be a lot more satisfying to many many people and will allow them to take part and enjoy playing some DM. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

To me it is about the effect it seems to have on their hit boxes versus what the animation shows to be happening.  When an action can cause a persons hit box to no longer be in sync with their animation then I tend to regard that action as undesirable.  If I shoot a person in the head but their hit box currently is registering head shots in either their chest or some where above their head then I see it as a problem and this has been my exact experience with air humping. :indifferent to your disgust:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was afraid of what kind of debate this might spark, but its one that I thought was of valid concern. Crouching in the air is one thing and is totally acceptable but having macros which spam 50 crouch inputs so your hitbox's get screwed up is another. It's quite easy to see when someone is doing it and yes can also be done just by tapping the crouch key repeatedly. Theres no doubt that air humping is a hitbox exploit and can make shots not register at all.<br>
<br>
 Being that in the regular divisions it is not allowed to use other known exploits such as phys lock, weapon erase, and using out of bounds areas in certain maps that were not clipped properly, I don't see why this couldn't be a rule for killbox. It's been quite clear that due to these rules, these exploits have not been a issue as people just don't do it, so enforcement has not been hard at all.<br>
<br>
I think if it were to be decided that it was not going to be allowed, yet a player was doing it in a match then it would just be a matter of one player stating in game chat that air humping is not allowed and please stop. If the other player continues to do it the demo could be reviewed and if it were determined that it was excessively done the match could be overturned.<br>
<br>
Its not like air humping is something that accidentally happens, it's done intentionally and very easy to spot. Ive played a few hundred hours of killbox now and against some of the best killbox players, what I've seen is that the best players do not do it because they know its a cheap exploit and they don't like it when players do it to them.

Fast shotgun exploit was made illegal and enforced and cut it down in matches<br>
weapon erase, and using out of bounds areas in certain maps that were not clipped properly,<br>
closest to this would be scrolling for multi-pushing in sta which was enforced and players didn't do it in fear of having matches overturned.

It is not hard to enforce extreme air humping. Hey if you duck more then 10 times in the air you are air humping. But whatever tresh hold you set air humping at you are going to have people push the limit. IE. even if its set at duck more then once per jump you are in trouble, after a couple weeks of competition all the good players will strategically be pressing duck once while they are in the air to look jacked up. If it's 10 they will do it 9 times. Second having visited alot of killboxes I can say for sure that the vast majority of air humpers are the better / competitive guys which begs the question will they not play if they cannot do it? If you said you had a league and bunny hopping was illegal you would not see alot of the current clans join it. My point is some people view it as an advanced technique or just a fair technique. I don't know what you are going to do about it but once again I see mostly CAL players discussing it which is not what we wanted.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We can try to set a limit on it so it's not over used, if as Steell says it is a part of movement sometimes then we need to allow for that but if the player airhumps every time he is in battle, then that should not be allowed. I personally do not think all the good kb players do it, I do see a lot of it tho.<br>

Velocity- I played a match yesterday with 375 gravity and no changes to the velocity and I could barely move and it fell very odd to me. I though maybe we should try setting up a test server, I could use mine, with different settings for diff days and let people try them out and take a vote, the one with the most votes gets it.<br>

This^<br>
<br>
Ive been killboxing off and on since i started playing the game, and have never lost a match or had trouble landing shots on a player because they spammed crouch.<br>
<br>
Also, more rules that, when potentially broken, require careful demo analysis or "admin judgement", really arent a good idea at all.<br>
<br>
I dont see that CAL needs STAs habit of banning advanced techniques that offend a few select players either.<br>

I did not say all the good players air hump. Notice the difference. Not the point I was trying to make. When you go into a server and a guy is air humping he is a decent player in relative terms. Most often he is the 2nd place guy in my experience. They are a group that people may want to consider when forging rules.  As opposed to complete noobs who dont even move off the spawn you never see them air humping and wont see them in leagues. If the killboxers want to ban it they will if they don't it means they like it. <br>
<br>
It doesnt matter how much you play KB the fact is that you are contaminated with the the ideas of a seasoned competitive players. Something about that has not worked for killbox players which is why we need to stay out. Yes my whole clan has topped TSGK servers logged hundreds of scrimmages against killbox clans, and juice and conflict and be seen playing them tons but if they vote upon league issues it will be in a direction that is more akin to the current competitive crowd rather then what the "killboxers" want. That is what needs to should be avoided. Let the killboxers forge the league on their own terms and then join it if it suits you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Airhumping- Personally, I like to allow it at least for the first season see if it is a problem in any way, it may not be. The league needs as many people to join as it can to be successful, I do not want to discourage anyone from joining. However this will be discussed by the committee when we meet tonight 8PM, EST. Hope that's a good time for everyone kinda trying to do it at night since it's a Sunday, I realize foreign committee members may not able to join, I will keep transcripts of the meeting. I will start a chat in the group at that time and whoever is available will get an invite, then I can review with our foreign committee at a better time and round up the results.<br>
<br>
Then at some point will get together with Fearsome and Paradox to discuss the final details and hopefully open the rosters for players to enter. I think we have more than enough attention for a tentative, when people see it's a done deal with rules and settings they can check out I personally think we will get more attention.<br>
<br>
Maps-We have a good list of maps to choose from, depending on how many we need we will use as many as suggested as long as they qualify for our needs.<br>
<br>
Settings- Grav/velocity will have to be decided, this will be our most difficult issue imo, I am going to try to review some of the tsgk records on what kb/lg servers have and how popular they are, then see what we can work out that will be again what we start with, first season, thinking we will get it perfect is just insane. We will have to tweak more after the first season and this will be based on your feedback, important that you keep records so we can look back and see what your suggestions or problems were based on.<br>
<br>
The success of this league will fall in every participants shoulders, we all want to see it happen lets keep and open mind and patience for things will happen, I will be happy to sit down with people once a week to discuss anything that arises once the season starts.<br>

In my experience (which like Punk's has mostly revolved around killboxes as of late) is that air humping is rather polarizing.  Either people despise it or they see it as perfectly acceptable.  Consequently I think what ever you decide you will discourage some people from joining.  Best bet is figure out the percentages and cater to the larger group.<br>
<br>
My own experience again shows that at least at KBH (where I have spent a lot of time recently) that air humping is discouraged by the better players.  Those doing it are called out for it and either quti air humping or move on.  Looking through their psycho stats I have to go outside the top 30 to find a player I know air humps.  I am aware that KBH is only a small part of the low grav KB community.<br>
<br>
To Fearsome's point, I do agree with him that this league needs to cater the traditional KB player.  That said I don't personally see the harm in a player (like Punk or myself) who have been playing lots of low grav KB lately but also have experience in regular CAL providing some insight.  If anything it causes the traditional low grav KB players to consider things up front that could become issues down the road.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The most adjustment if you think about it will be for the clans and players that like very low grav, max, six, td, 5150 come to mind, but they are willing to do this to make this successful so everyone keep an open mind.<br>
<br>
One thing I would like you guys to discuss is high pingers, we will have foreign players coming in and we expect a few high pingers, we do not want to discourage, how do we deal with this issue?<br>

	<div class="content">high pingers is a non-issue imho. unless someone comes in with 400 ping anything below 200 is playable and will not affect the server or others on it.<br>
about settings - changing only grav basically leaves only one group happy. please discuss and come to a common ground to suit EVERYONE. it's possible and everyone are up for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Something that i really didn't want to see is happening here - stock bunnyhoppers when playing Killbox come to play either on KBH or TSGK. now. while i hold nothing but the utmost respect to KBH and TSGK and their great maps ( and i really do !!) those bhopers are still, maybe without noticing and obviously without malice, voicing out the stock CAL society's mindset. bhoppers are in the KB commity - WTF ???<br>
<br>
The whole diff settings issue last i read this forum stood at 'ok, we need to sit down and think how to do this...maps can be adjusted and so forth'. now, it looks as if the decision was already made and settings will not vary throughout the league. sorry, im part of this commity and i don't recall attending a meeting which decisded this.<br>
The discussion needs to be reviewed again. bhopes obviously won't like diff settings. but this is not a league that caters for them so guys, maybe you think that posting in the line of "well, i know it wont make a difference but i think bla bla" looks like you're like you're not interfering but that's just bs,....what makes a difference is you guys coming in and filling the thread with your thoguhts, your preferences, your way of thinking.  stop. <br>
if you play LD in matches - dont sit in a KB commity. don't take part in threads related to a KB league. you want to enter the matches? - awesome and super awesome but please let this be your only participance.<br>
<br>
So again, thank you for joining us and supporting the KB league but please move away and let this forge itself to something solid. take part. enjoy. let this league take off and try not creating what seems to be just another CAL stock league only with KB maps and diff grav. that's rediculous and this is NOT what we meant to happen.<br>
<br>
Admins and clan reps - show some backbone and come in here to voice out your preferences or this is to be a bhopers playground. the idea was - again - to connect this part of the community with the rest and may i add, the lionshare of this community. introduce more ppl to competative gameplay and coalesce the different fractures into a one society. as yet - im not seeing anything close to it.<br>

i think we should have both 1v1 and either 2v2 or 3v3 (dicission will be based on popular demand i guess)<br>
 AND an A level and B level.<br>
<br>
my reasoning is to first and foremost allow low level player compete while not closing the doors to high level players.<br>

I think the low gravity maps should have the gravity set at the most popular settings.  IMO Gdawgg designed maps should not be set at 375.  No server has them at that gravity that I'm aware of, and having a tourny at that gravity for those maps doesn't make sense.  Also 1v1 is cool but I think we should do 3v3 as well.  Some of the low grav maps are pretty large.  There's no reason why we can't do 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 is there?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Before things get carried away. There is currently only 1 person who has contacted me about running the KB division. Their are proposals for as many as 4 divisions. I had really only expected that there would be 1 division to start. Now we are talking about A &amp; B, teams and singles. There isn't enough evidence that can happen so decisions need to be made about where the smartest place to start is. I can venture a guess looking at the possible lists that 1v1 is pretty much dominated by CAL I only see 2 names I do not recognize that may be killbox players in 1v1. Where 3v3 looks to have a majority of killbox clans. In either one there is only enough for 1 division after the usual drop out rates. I can possibly see 2 divisions happening but not 4. If for no other reason you gotta prove that the season will start and finish with some teams. If it is to be 2 really then a choice would have to be made between singles and teams  or and A &amp; B division of one of those. Still need another admin.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hey there,  I heard about this from Valar and Ill ask my Clan membs if any are interested in participating and just for the record (we always play at 125-150 grav and default airaccel)  Alot of us airhump and dont see any problem with it (low grav has that perq/function).   We play killbox_tower alot (great map for 3 vs 3. But no matter what you all decide (grav settings, map , players whatever.. it sounds like alot of fun and IM sure I can get atleast 3-6 of my membs to play forsure and through out the season.    <br>
<br>
(a good idea also would be to mix any clan membs with a different clans membs to make it unite more existing players together.   Plus it would help with the "finding the right grav setting" problem.  <br>
<br>
Example I have in mind:         <br>
<br>
Your clan plays 400 grav always/mostly (4 membs sign up to play in  league)<br>
                                        <br>
My clan plays at 150 grav  (4 membs sign up to play in league)<br>
<br>
                                     leaving us   4 vs 4<br>
<br>
    <br>
team A = 2 of your membs and 2 of mine    VS.   team B = 2 of your membs and 2 of mine<br>
<br>
(doesnt have to be 2 of mine 2 of yours..<br>
 could be 3 vs 3 (ex:[EYE],six,{max} vs [51/50],{FL},[TKO]......  you get the idea... <br>
 <br>
or  <br>
<br>
just sign up to the league with your team already put together and be willing to play on what ever server at whatever gravity and have some fun.  See if you and your team can make it to the end and win ( would make the winning of this thing much more meaningful and fun)     Well thanks for letting me post this and thanks to all of ya for working on getting this game going again.

Yes, Fearsome a lot of talk is going on doesn't mean this is part of the plan, please consider this everyone is getting a say who is truly interested to play the league yet it doesn't mean that every idea is even being considered. My main concert ATM is the amount of leets trying to get in and make it theirs, which I really like to discourage. The word is getting out if you notice we are seeing more names post who are lowgrav/killbox players and I am hoping to get even more interested, at the same time I do not wish to discourage anyone. I have been spamming anyone I can think off and we shall see a little more, but they won't get in and post if they think this is just another worthless effort, I can say comfortably we have enough attention for this to get serious. <br>
<br>
Remember also to the players also playing regular CAL, these two leagues will be playing most likely at the same time, do you have the time for both? Knowing league players most likely when the time comes you will pick the most important to you, I don't see that being this division, so please do not try to do it all.<br>
<br>
We could do just 1v1 and 2v2 or 3v3, but if Fearsome is set on just one then personally I like to see the clan effort, because that would get MORE people involved in the long run.<br>

fearsome, if i'm just assisting one of the divisions on the stock side this season, feel free to divide my time between stock and kb.  i do play kb/lg from time to time, but know bubkis about the variable gravity/acceleration settings.  still, i'm willing to assist/grow CAL in any capacity i can.  use me and abuse me.  <br>

	<div class="content">It is both lack of admins and lack of proof of concept. I mean anyone can come in and say I am going to do something (managed plenty of rec sports teams to see tons of empty promises) But actually doing it things may be vastly different. The casualties for the 1v1 league are something like greater then 50% of players are kicked or dropped due to inactivity. So you have 13 players up there which is good but if 50% drop you have 7 players, if alot of surprise people join who do not post then thats good but either way you need to see a season completed before you boot up another division for each. Believe it or not it takes alot of time for everyone, and people need to show support on both sides of the fence. If kb players want a league we will deliver one in exchange they need to show up and play it out even if every detail is not exactly has they dreamed. Then if it works out we can talk about B divisions and other variants. We need proof in the form of a completed season that people will in fact play this before we try to run tons of leagues.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Actually, people who have been driving this part and communicating it are killbox players.  And have been actively talking this up in all sorts of forums and servers.

Because there are KB players who dont want to play stock type maps and stock players who dont want to play KB.  <br>

I believe with the popularity of KB in hl2dm, it deserves a chance at its own league with all its own maps, settings and player base.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This league is supposed to be for low grav players. So I do not understand why there are so many high grav people taking part and trying to give there opinion on how are settings will not work. You all have you own leagu already. Let our admins run this one our way.<br>
<br>
I am very interested in this. However Pomp I see you want more people voicing opinions in here that are interested. I have been reading and keeping up with this just not a lot of posting. I personaly do not think 350/375 can even realy be considered low grav. But you gota understand I come from a rare clan that had grav at its lowest and air accel at its highest. O wait your in my clan so you know this LOL <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
Any way. I know I am not at the same level as a lot of these other cal players. But I want to learn and I want to play.<br>
I have not posted anything about signing up. Since I have kinda been waiting to find out exactly whats going on. I do have a full time job. I am usualy home by 4:30 eastern. And while I am very interested I have no plan of takinga day off of work to play a league match. So i am interested in when/where this all takes place. <br>
I do not have knowledge enough to be an admin of the servers. I do have knowledge enough to be a forum moderator.<br>
I am willing to learn the admin stuff. But I figure i will when I start my own server eventualy.<br>
<br>
Any looking forward to see where this goes.<br>
Hoping it goes well and kicks off. Low grav players have never had a league before.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

</div></blockquote>

The short answer is that many people play both regular grav and low grav and have a desire to compete.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>{MaX}Fragganator wrote:</cite>And while I am very interested I have no plan of takinga day off of work to play a league match. So i am interested in when/where this all takes place.</div></blockquote>

No reason to take a day off.  Many of us have fulltime jobs.<br>
<br>
The way it typically works is that your have a set match time.  Before that match time occurs you are required to make contact with your opponent(s) through a system called MatchComm (on the CAL site).  You arrange a time to play the match that works for everyone if the default time isn't good.  You have a week to get your match played before an admin comes in and marks both teams for a forfeit.  In actual practice if you are showing that you are trying to work out the match then most admins let you go for much longer (I have played matches as much as four weeks late).<br>
<br>
Typically there is a 2 week preseason, a 8 week regular season, and a 3 week post season.  I believe you are scored as follows: 3 points for a win, 2 for a loss, 1 for a forfeit win, and 0 for a forfeit loss.  The preseason matches don't count for place.  After the 8 week season the top 8 teams based upon points play in the post season.<br>
<br>
Traditionally in 1v1 each player picks a map.  If after the 2 games you have a tie (both players each won a map) then you play a 3rd game that is on the map the admins picked for that week.  In tdm you play 2 matches on the map the admins picked for that week, total the scores from both games, and the team with the largest score wins.<br>
<br>
Of course all this could be changed for this league, but that is the way it as been done in the past for CAL.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
What is going to happen tho as I mention once the season starts a lot of the reg cal players will spend more time there since it is more intense, BUT FRAG is right, we need more low grav or killbox people to come around and post not lurk or talk to me on IM [you know y'all doing it] Ok so I am taking myself off steam for a couple of days.. I will be around plus is no secret I have health issues and the doc want's me to have complete bed rest so I do not end up in the hospital for a week [I am  that much of a wimp, my trip wiped me out] Plus my finger still sliced pretty bad {way to go pomp!} either way why I mention that is more of a we do need more admins, maybe 2 full time and 1 part time? Just in case, ya never know, someone can't fully be there for a lil bit.<br>

Oh I wanted to mention for those that don't know, if your clan doesn't want to participate, get a a couple of buddies and make up a team!! You can come up with a silly name and sign up, best to have more than 2 buddies back you up tho for the season. I am considering doing this for Team Veracity [shamless plug] so anyone who doesn't have a clan or a team, feel free to talk to me or o-dog, that's what we do! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>

bs there are enough KBers in here for the discussion. most of the posts in this thread from high grav are redundant in fact and belong in the cafeteria. &lt;3<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>BuckyKatt wrote:</cite>
The way it typically works is that your have a set match time. Before that match time occurs you are required to make contact with your opponent(s) through a system called MatchComm (on the CAL site). You arrange a time to play the match that works for everyone if the default time isn't good. You have a week to get your match played before an admin comes in and marks both teams for a forfeit. In actual practice if you are showing that you are trying to work out the match then most admins let you go for much longer (I have played matches as much as four weeks late).<br>
<br>
Typically there is a 2 week preseason, a 8 week regular season, and a 3 week post season. I believe you are scored as follows: 3 points for a win, 2 for a loss, 1 for a forfeit win, and 0 for a forfeit loss. The preseason matches don't count for place. After the 8 week season the top 8 teams based upon points play in the post season.<br>
<br>
Traditionally in 1v1 each player picks a map. If after the 2 games you have a tie (both players each won a map) then you play a 3rd game that is on the map the admins picked for that week. In tdm you play 2 matches on the map the admins picked for that week, total the scores from both games, and the team with the largest score wins.<br>
<br>
Of course all this could be changed for this league, but that is the way it as been done in the past for CAL.</div></blockquote>

This league could obviously have different rules than standard CAL but the answer from standard CAL is a definite "Yes, admins can play."  Indeed I believe every standard CAL admin plays in the league (1v1, 2v2, 4v4) they are representing.  The beauty of the system is that there are people above them to help resolve disputes that involve them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes you can the issue with playing in the league is that people are worried about corruption which is a fair point but I personally believe the best admins are active players and it will be hard to hold someones attention when they are working for free if they are not participating. If you are there in the league you will pay more attention to it. And that is the better way to go from my experience.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sure.  I am more than happy to help.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>L2k wrote:</cite>maplist is looking really good, dont forget you will have to narrow it down to 8 though.</div></blockquote>

Yes... again giving a historical perspective.  You pick 8 maps.  Those maps are played during the regular season.  The two of those 8 that are uncommon or unfamiliar are also played in preseason to give people a chance to become familiar with them before it counts in regular season.  For post season 3 of those 8 maps are chosen.  Often these are the most familiar or the ones that have "defined" the style of play.  A good example of this in stock is dm_lockdown (or its derivatives).  It almost always shows up as the championship map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok.. lessee.. Yes Maplist is basically what people posted and some we discussed, although I could not remember the name of one Steell showed us, we can test, play on it with the settings we are considering and decided on a final maplist.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>

I like to participate even if I admin, I am with Fearsome, if it ever becomes a problem or a questions then that can be addressed at that time, I was thinking of only doing the 3v3 with team veracity. <br>

Best way for KBH to keep the numbers is round up as many people who would like to participate for the clan and have them as back up, Aunt Jemima, that way you always have coverage.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>

Not really.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
For 1v1 you run the match as a dm match.  Each person can pick their model (combine or rebel).<br>
<br>
For 2v2 and up you run the match as a tdm match.  Each team is expected to have a server that is available to run matches on.  The team listed as home gets to play on their server first.  They play as combine and the away team plays as rebel.  For the second game you move to the away teams server.  The away team plays combine and the home team plays as rebels.<br>
<br>
Doing it this way each team plays rebels once and combine once and you get "home court advantage" once.<br>
<br>
In practice a lot of time both matches are played on the same server if everyone's pings are pretty much equal.  Then you just switch models between games.<br>
<br>
All matches are played on sv_pure 2 servers so only the default models are allowed (no bright skins and such).<br>
<br>
You are expected to take screen shots of the status command in console as well as the sv_pure of the server.  You also take screen shots of your opponents.  This serves as proof that everything was set up according to the rules.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think you definitely need to have 1v1, a large percentage of the interest has been for 1v1.<br>
when it comes to anything other than 1v1 be it 2v2 or 3v3 I think just one of those would be fine and you really only need one admin per division to get it going.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You keep making this point.  I suspect what you will find is that if the leet players who bunnyhop decide that they want to play the lg kb league that there will be little you can do to stop them from dominating (whether you make it 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 and irrespective of the gravity you set).  Put simply, and this is key, for most of those players it isn't a mastery of a single style of play (regular grav stock) but rather mastery of the game itself.  Further they have many seasons of league play under their belt so they are already experienced in playing as a cohesive unit.  The real question is whether the standard grav guys are going to be willing to play an entire season of low grav killbox.  My own guess is that the majority of them will not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

it does not answer the problem. in fact, it has little if anything to do with the problem.<br>

	<div class="content">Ok lets get this point straight, NORMAL Gravity is 600 (some say 800).  Therefore LOW gravity is anything less than 600, its just a matter of degree.  350-475 is low gravity, 150 is low gravity (maybe ultra low would be a better term). <br>
<br>
Valar, Fearsome has much the same concern as you and I have to agree.  It is imperitive that the league is designed by members of the KILLBOX community, not people who, although they may play KB from time to time, spend most of their time in stock settings.  So please, stock players, refrain from input.  This is not to say that you have nothing valuable to contribute, but the point is that we want this to appeal to the KB community, we dont want the stock settings community putting their particular spin on it, plain and simple.  That said there are some general rules in CAL that will apply to this league the same as the others.   What you do for maps and server settings (gravity, acceleration, etc) is up to the people designing the league and therein lies your ability to make it appealing to those you wish to attract.<br>
<br>
It might be a concern to see mostly stock players interested in the 1v1 because it may drive the very people we are trying to make this league for away and if that happens it will most likely fail.  However, I dont know how fair it would be to restrict people from participating simply because they play mostly stock settings.  On the other hand, it might serve to unite the game community Valar, simply because some of them will be playing together for the first time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well you could make a whacky rule like anyone playing in any other CAL league cannot compete in the killbox league. Not sure I would agree with that. But realistically what can you do create a protectionism league (nations cup)? Even in CS which has many leagues main, open, invite, premier, ultra super duper, you still have teams that go into the open league and clean up. You can't stop good players from dominating. But what you can do is get enough players and teams to play, there are those nasty matches but there are lots of good ones too. As with all league play there is going to be domination, and some of it will be killbox clans dominating other killbox clans and they wont feel any better about it. The good news is if people are harassing or being unsportsman like they can be suspended. <br>
<br>
From admining CAL for a long time I have seen matches I thought decently close, 2v2s within 20 points and one team still makes a cheat dispute and then leaves the league. So what I am saying is that some people just cant handle losing thats all and nothing you do will change that it is their personality. The way cal scheduling works teams are pitted against each other based on their rank. So better teams should move up and play other better teams and most matches should quickly get good. But in order for that to work a range of skill levels have to show up and play if teams take off on the first loss it will not work. If only 2 kb clans join and stay then you will only get 1 match vs another kb clan. If you come in with an open mind everyone will learn something and become better players and each group may learn to respect the other a little more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sorry if I misunderstood your point.  It seemed to me that your main complaint was on the potential for the standard grav players to come in and dominate.  I feel that some degree of that is inevitable and, baring a rule like fearsome mentioned, largely unstoppable.<br>

	<div class="content">The whole idea of a league is to play to win, in every league there are going to be players and teams that stand out over the others. In the regular hl2dm divisions this is true, yet teams that have hardly won come back usually and try again and they keep playing and they improve, Killbox won't really be any different. If you are a killbox only or a stock only or a person who just likes to play all aspects of hl2dm it does not matter, there will always be those who have devoted more time and effort into becoming a better player and its just the way it is.<br>
<br>
Also I dont really see what all the worry is about regular stock grav players coming into play the killbox, because I can say for sure that if KBH Punisher or Xs Redeyes or Xs MOP (just to name a few KB only guys) come and sign up they will likely dominate the leet stock player as well as the Killbox only players so we should just get away from this whole topic as it is not valid.<br>
<br>
The idea is to have fun, be competitive, learn and improve for the average player, then come back and try to do better.<br>
<br>
One more point I would like to make is that there are some players like me who started out playing only Killbox, moved into standard grav, learned the advanced movement and such, got into competitive play and yet still play killbox on a regular basis. So just because we sometimes play out of the box does not make us any less important in the grand scheme of things, it just means that we enjoy all aspects of hl2dm mp and want to compete in various types of the game, and our opinions and inputs should not be automatically disregarded.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

*1v1 and 2v2<br>
*The settings we were thinking on 350 grav and 50 air_velocity, was a good medium ground.<br>
*A combination of old style Killboxes and some Newer ones to keep it interesting.<br>

	<div class="content">Ok i'll try and clarify this for the last time. This is a simple point and yet it keeps coming across the wrong way here for some reason;<br>
<br>
<br>
NO ONE - including myself and the Dalai Lama is trying to prevent anyone from playing. They can be high grav, low self esteem, mid west or cross-dressing. Period and get over it. Everyone can play the killbox league. So yay.<br>
<br>
Now, we ARE concerned, knowing how far apart killboxers and high grav players are FOR THE MOST PART (And please save the “after a 1v1 I went to pub on KBH and it was w0Ot” lost stories lol. its getting old and we got the idea  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> ) and how in general low grav and many other people playing HL2DM shy CAL - we want to create call it a safe environment, a greenhouse for them to come in to,,,....play a first season. Enjoy. Meet some new people. Mingle,. . . .get the idea?  . ...<br>
<br>
All this thread was intended for was to make a decision about which fricking GRAVITY to use in the Killbox League. Look and see the many pointless and useless posts one has to dig through to get to the point of the whole thread.<br>
Please redirect your amazingly sharp minds and uncontrollable sense of disgust towards your current favorite someone-to-hate over to the cafeteria.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Ok, so this thread if anything already crystallized one thing for sure - sv_gravity 375<br>
Thank god. Next.<br>
We shall have a committee meeting on Sunday where we will try and test out the different air and accelerate settings and see how we can make all this work.<br>
Also we will look at some other maps and we want to come up with a solid map list. Hopefully all by end of next week. That will be sweet.<br>
<br>
KB Admins - Please try to ignore and move away from interferences what and whoever they might be and stick to the subject.<br>
(hint, not giving a toss about who likes you might help. some threads left unanswered sometimes does the job much better in a crowd of haters.)<br>

	<div class="content">This league is not intended to be slightly different from the standard league. It's an entirely different league which is being designed for an entirely different style of play. We are not discouraging anyone from playing, but if you want to play you will have to accept the settings chosen for the league. If you dislike it, then there's another perfectly functional league with settings you may like more.<br>
<br>
Here is what we have waiting to be set in stone after a final test:<br>
sv_gravity 350<br>
sv_airaccellerate 50<br>
Everything else STOCK<br>
<br>
These settings allow moderate movement in the air with the gravity set as low as it is. Some people have been commenting on how low is low gravity. 300 is half of the game's stock gravity of 600, so if any gravity is to be considered low, it would be around there, perhaps in the 300-450 range. Anything higher than that is just lowER gravity. The change would not be distinct enough to warrant its own league and attract the new players which this league was created for.<br>
<br>
To the "leet" cal regulars: you guys already have a league, and as such this league will not be tending to your wishes. 2 cents and opinions are fine, but in the long run we will not be picking settings simply because x many cal regulars want them; they will be chosen for the intended audience of the league. Right now, those settings are the ones listed above.<br>
<br>
There you go Pomp, I said it so you didn't have to. And apologies to those of you who have been arguing this all along.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ty Valar, we will be trying the settings mentioned then on Sunday 8pm est, please this is only open those that are participating in this league.<br>

Any more map suggestions? I was just at TKO server and they have a lot of good maps, trying to lure them in here so go check them out see if any would be good for the league.<br>

For all you mani admins out there... keep in mind that plugins are not allowed in CAL.  Consequently these configs contain a plugin_pause_all command.  After one of these configs is run you will no longer be able to admin via mani (or any other plugin).  Rcon will be your only real option.  I also can not remember if a map change re-enables plugins so it may be smart to add a plugin_unpause_all command to your server.cfg file.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Weeeeee!<br>
<br>
Did you guys check to see what kind of speeds that is going to make possible?<br>
<br>
In just a quick check on kbh 2 I was doing average 725 velocities on the floor and 1500 in the air and that seems kinda fast to me, but if its what the community wants, ok. People not used to those kinds of speeds may have trouble registering shots on players moving that fast. Oh also I don't consider myself a real fast mover either just average so some other people I know will be much faster than that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ok, yes if you are not used to it the movement may seem fast at first, like anything else after you have played it for a bit you will love it. Remember those settings are designed for movement in the air as well, you will have to adjust a little bit for ground movement so you can start gaining air movement. You will need to practice which i strongly recommend anyway, if you think oh hell I will just show up the day of, think again. remember NO PLUGINS mean no spawn protection, so if you never played Cal, you are for a rude awakening as you have to move real fast from your spawn area to be able to stay alive. time will fly by, no chance to "warm up" or get your game on... you need to be fast and furious right off the bat!

	<div class="content">This guy released hl2dm on the orange box as a mod, just installed and ran and it seems it is actually the orange box, can't speed crouch anymore and the crouch jump animation is at least fixed client side (no more screen twitch).You can still bunnyhop but you can't restart it as fast.<br>

I want to see how it plays with other people but so far here's what it's got,<br>
<br>

The fire and particle effects look a lot different.<br>
<br>

Return of the blue orb.<br>
<br>

The orange box orbs look fuckin nuts, and speaking of fuckin nuts yes, I have an AWP, and here's the thing,<br>
<br>
<a href="http://img10.imageshack.us/my.php?image=rllockdown0006.jpg" class="postlink"><img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/1346/rllockdown0006.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
It's deadly accurate at any range no scope unlike CSS<br>
<br>
There's a tau cannon now too it looks crazy but it is alpha stage so idc I guess, and the rpg holds 6 rounds and has a secondary fire feature now, secondary fire turns off the laser and the rocket fires straight like TF2.<br>

If you fire the RPG with the laser off, point the gun in a different direction, then turn the laser on does the rocket go towards the laser dot?<br>

completely agree, I think this mod is a joke tbh, trying to make hl2dm better by adding a hint of other games is stupid, really.. an ak47 and sniper rifle in hl2dm... is not hl2dm.

<br>
Fact is this guy is brand new at programming and probably just needs some balance help, but he managed to port the game by himself to a better engine and I think it has potential unlike hl2dm pro.<br>
<br>
The awp had a bad zoom for me too until I changed some graphics settings now it works.<br>

I imagine it can be tweaked to the way it should be concerning bunnyhop restart and balance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">it will be pretty cool if this modder pays attention to what the community wants, listens and implements things.<br>
So far I feel the game runs much smoother than regular dm, it just needs some tweaks. The pause after bhop would have to be fixed for sure. One thing I notice is that yo-yoing feels much easier and or more fluid IDK if its just animations, netcode or what.<br>
The shot gun reload animation glitch still exists though.<br>
I wouldn't mind the addition of the sniper and tau since its a mod, the AK though seems out of place.<br>
Maybe with the sniper riffle there could be some sort of penalty like slower movement, longer reload or something.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I agree and so do others, this game plays incredibly smooth on the orange box engine in comparison to the original, not to mention crouch animation fixed, speed crouch is fixed, and so far so good I'm crossing my fingers here, not one crash whatsoever (possibly fixed).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ive played a fair amount of pro and even in pro the tau is not abused as much as the rpg is currently in hl2. The other guns I could do without but as a mod its something that would be fine considering its not a replacement game for what we play now. If this guy wanted to do what the pro team did and make a vanilla mode and a modified mode that would be awesome. So far I love hl2dm on the OBE!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Kyle and I had a chance to hang out with the creator and play a 1v1 in the rl_lockdown map last night.  Aside from the bhop issue, it played pretty well for an alpha.  <br>
The player animations are different and kinda weird when you first see them.  It seems like maybe the speed of the leg animations don't match with the speed of side to side movement.  <br>
There were a few times that Kyle heard sounds coming from dead bodies.  I'm not sure if this is a bug or if Kyle has the ability to speak to the dead.  If it's the latter, I've got dibs on a TV show called "Crossing Over HL2DM".<br>
I don't really like the death cam.  When you die you stay in 1st person as you fall to the ground which is cool, but just doesn't feel right for hl2dm.  <br>
Speed crawling and prop jumping seem to be gone.<br>
While shooting alot of orbs at cars on the rl_overcast map the props became "charged", for lack of a better term.  You could shoot them with any weapon and they would fly across the map.  A few shots with a pistol were enough to pop a car up and send it flying out of the map.<br>
One of the downsides is that the creator doesn't seem to be concerned with competitive play.  He has plans for more new weapons (gluon gun being one).

	<div class="content">well cuz i like to tinker with mods and there setting i did happen to find the fix for the first person death its cl_fp something or other and talking with Janek earlier today he did happen to port the pro mod over to OB engine but with the shear amount of issues it has he didn't go any further in building it. since we as a community have such great developers: Keeper, Janek, Raticide, CTF mod makers, and the Cinematic mod maker idk why there can't be a collective force to make a good dm mod free of all the issues that we have now onto the OB engine and i do know that it would be a nightmare to take on that kind of task but if each individual worked on a specific bug seeing what parameters needing altering and how they affected the rest of the game and then comparing the each fix  issue and seeing what conflict they may have with a fix compared to another fix it may possibly resolved and enhanced far enough to promote to steam<br>
in which case we bring back old players and get new 1s but saying this is just 1 thing its such a daunting task and so many conflicting views that, well it will never get done sadly and steams not gonna get it done for us thats apparent right now</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@ svN: honestly i have no idea what you're talking about. your sarcastic reaction to my post made it clear you thought i was attacking you so i explain i wasn't. now your post makes even less sense than the first one.<br>
my point was and still is, if we are evaluating this new alpha we should post our comments on the Steam forum and not only here. YOU and YOUR post had nothing to do with it and i wasn't aiming anything at you. i don't even know you. my mapping thread is irrelevant unless you were just looking for something, anything to throw at me.<br>

	<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Uncle Rico wrote:</cite>Kyle and I had a chance to hang out with the creator and play a 1v1 in the rl_lockdown map last night.  Aside from the bhop issue, it played pretty well for an alpha.  <br>
The player animations are different and kinda weird when you first see them.  It seems like maybe the speed of the leg animations don't match with the speed of side to side movement.  <br>
There were a few times that Kyle heard sounds coming from dead bodies.  I'm not sure if this is a bug or if Kyle has the ability to speak to the dead.  If it's the latter, I've got dibs on a TV show called "Crossing Over HL2DM".<br>
I don't really like the death cam.  When you die you stay in 1st person as you fall to the ground which is cool, but just doesn't feel right for hl2dm.  <br>
Speed crawling and prop jumping seem to be gone.<br>
While shooting alot of orbs at cars on the rl_overcast map the props became "charged", for lack of a better term.  You could shoot them with any weapon and they would fly across the map.  A few shots with a pistol were enough to pop a car up and send it flying out of the map.<br>
One of the downsides is that the creator doesn't seem to be concerned with competitive play.  He has plans for more new weapons (gluon gun being one).  He seemed to be somewhat unconcerned about the bhop issue since he doesn't care too much for it anyway.  He did say that he could fix the shotty animation problem though.  <br>
I actually didn't mind the new weapons too much.  They feel out of place at first, but it was kinda refreshing to see something different.  I could see gameplay being dramatically changed with their addition.  <br>
One of the problems to overcome with the progression of this game is our own stubbornness.  We want to see it evolve and be better, but keep all the things in it that make it uniquely HL2DM.  If HL3DM ever happens, it's likely that most of us will hate it anyway.  Using the OBE is probably our best bet to keep the game as close to the original while fixing its problems.

Not really a good point at all!<br>
Considering since day one I have always used the same finger (pinky) for sprint and crouch (shift=sprint, z=crouch) I have never tried (or needed) to press both at once. I move at around 500 all day long no problems here. Maybe thats why I dont see it as that much different in OBE.<br>
I guess some people are just more dedicated to this one of a kind game than others, and some will be able to adapt some wont. But this sprinting in a crouched position is nothing to complain about, it hardly is needed unless you are speedcrawling.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Understandable, I don't want to argue either and I can respect your opinion. I guess I just can't figure out why pressing crouch and sprint at the same time is even necessary other than speedcrawling.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Bhop is pretty much back to what regular DM feels like and prop jumps work.<br>

Now just needs speedcrawl and such and quicker animations that match up with movement.  <br>
<br>
As for graphics the game looks like it has a new sheen to it.<br>
<br>
Try milieu_final out and turn your video settings to max to see what I mean.<br>
<br>
Flashlight casts shadows now.<br>
<br>
Flames and volumetric fog look more realistic.<br>
<br>
Motion blur works when shaking mouse back in forth.<br>
<br>
More servers and bug fixes and this thing is gonna be a winner.<br>

	<div class="content">I think speedcrawl should be kept if at all possible.  I use it to silently sneak around during 1v1s sometimes and is what HL2DM is about.  I love it for the advanced movement and taking the speedcrawl out won't be a big deal to me but having it in would add a small level of l33tness in my mind.  Rabbit punching, bhop, speedcrawl, grave-nading/cooking, Zoom+Mag sniping, and many other things that make this game stand out as the best multiplayer shooter are what makes this game worth playing still.  Although I'm probably the most newb at this :/<br>

I hadn't tried it on an updated version until today.  Unless I'm just doing it wrong, the speed is nowhere near what the speedcrawl speed used to be.  I could live with that.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Vendetta7_7_7 wrote:</cite>Whats air humping?  Is that the Jesus?</div></blockquote>
Nah, air humping is mostly seen in killbox low g servers.  Spamming crouch while in the air and the animation looks retarded and people use it to try to avoid being hit.  I think there's a few scripts out there for it too.  I don't play killboxes too much, but when I do it's not that air humping makes me miss, it just annoys me and makes me target the person doing it just to make them ragequit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I didn't take a screen shot or anything and I didn't think about the numbers until right-now, figures may be off, but OB 2's crawling is good as is. Prop Jumping is, in-fact, gone - not even Nutri-Grain could do his barrel jumping on his own listen server. <br>

40+ tests and I have yet to crash or have a RPG go unguided on me. This stuff is promising. <br>

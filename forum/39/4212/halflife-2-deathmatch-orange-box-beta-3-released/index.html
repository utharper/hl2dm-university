To be honest i think it would be kool if u could only jump x/ml, would actually make it an actual timing skill, but im not really concerned about it.<br>
And theres still macros, my mouse has macros, i didnt even know for ages till i saw the option in there one day,  i even bought a keyboard that doesnt have macros, so, if i have the ability to make macros, without even meaning to, im sure anyone who wants to use multiple action keys, will do so.<br>

Technically its not a macro, that makes it sound like its a script.  Its a keybind folks, you are just keybinding jump to mwheel, which is a key like all the others that just happens to spin.<br>
<br>
Its not really an advantage, its just a technique people learn to make bhop even easier to perform.   Its not some magical script that people hack the game code to do.   Everyone can do it.   If people learn it, its not an advantage, which I think is what Tiggy's point was.  <br>

Most of us have learned to drive, does that give us any special powers over the people that dont?  Not really because most of them will learn in eventually and in some places like New York City, knowing how to drive gets you nothing because of mass transit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I wanted to test the result of your work sub-zero. Cuz well I have already DLed the C++ code of HL2 provided with the SDK to try to mod and when I have seen the number of bugs that was remaining in this non clean code and given that I didnt have the free time I needed I have canceled what I was planing to xD So with the Orange box code added I imagine it cant have been easy.<br>
<br>
So well played, the OB engine looks like to be well implemented. The way the maps are redenring looks better too. And quite funny to see the scoreboard in the OB style, like in TF2.<br>
<br>
So thx to you for this release. It's what should have provided valve for months.<br>
<br>
<br>
To come back of what have been said ( yep I'm late x) ) I agree with most of the things.<br>
- Indeed the zap of the combine stick is a prob.<br>
- Indeed a way to know quicker if you are rebel or combine is better.<br>
- Indeed the scroll jump is not a cheat given that its fully "manual"<br>
- And indeed the combine sound is a big disadvantage.<br>
<br>
But to set the rebel sound for both team is not the solution. Cuz you cant preshoot anymore !! I mean if you are rebel and hear a combine sound behind a wall you know its an enemy and you can jump behind the wall and preshoot him whithout seeing him yet. If both teams have the same sound you have 1 chance among 2 to team-kill one of your friend. Without that help of the sounds you lost precious informations :/ So the solution is not a rebel sound for the combine : its to record a new sound, as smooth as the rebel one, not noisy like the combine, but different from the rebel one. But I know its not easy to record that kind of sound ^^<br>

Thats a good idea. HL has a lot to learn about Quake (like unique nick and account in QL, the ready system to start matches, etc...) but I have lost everyhope to see that since sv_pure 2 has come and since most of the leagues are running matches with sv_pure 2. Its a good point for some reasons but in another hand 3 years ago we were playing with brights skins in HL2 and then (at least in Europe I dont know for US people) in CU for instance a unique guy has decided that matches will be with sv_pure 2 cuz bright skins were a cheat and we were not able anymore to play with them (when In quake its allowed for almost 10 years and when its a console command to turn it on x) )<br>
<br>
So a force_enemy_model doesnt go in the way of sv_pure 2 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Man if you set them the same then you cant ditinguish by the sound if behind you or behind the wall it's a rebel or a combine. So you have to play with what you see only and no more with what you hear. Good players always play with the sound.<br>

Would using new sounds they will revert back to defaults from the gcf when sv_pure is used, if tyou used code to apply rebel footsteps all round then sv_pure 2 will work yes becasue they come straight from the gcf?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is exactly my point.  Rebel footsteps are very difficult to hear at times whereas the jingle, jangle, clang, jingity jang of the combine sounds can be heard by a deaf man without a sound card.    No one likes playing combine and any player above the level of noob never ever uses a combine model in a FFA or 1v1 match simply because the sound gives the other side a huge advantage.  Its just not a fair fight unless you make them both equal in terms of loudness/ablity to be heard.   Otherwise, the combine side might as well paint themselves orange and stand in the middle of a map saying "Shoot me I am over here!"  <br>
<br>
Here is a thought:  It would level the playing field so to speak and might actually make everyone have to use a bit more strategy if the sounds from both models could both be heard equally.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Pretty sure that is what he did, just not with the exact same sound. I don't think the sounds should be identical either. They should be equal in dbs though and should also be equal in terms of how often they are played. For example, rebels basically just have a footstep sound whereas combines have footsteps AND a jingle.

Exactly what I had in mind <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> Same "quantity" of noise, same dB, but different <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
<br>
And keefy I dont see why you speak of sv_pure 2. Sv_pure 2 forbide custom stuff (custon sounds in this case) The ones you add yourself as a player. As a client. Whereas we speak to add them in the code of the game no ?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I recently found some information regarding games being moved to the OB engine.  An update was released for Gmod yesterday which moved it to the OB enigine.  Since I haven't heard anything about other games being moved yet it would seem that Gmod is the ginny (lol spelling) pig.  Hopefully hl2dm is soon to follow, I'm interested to see what it will change/improve if anything at all.<br>
Article here:    <a href="http://www.steamfriends.com/steam/p2_articleid/1155" class="postlink">http://www.steamfriends.com/steam/p2_articleid/1155</a><br>
<br>
This move to a new engine seems pretty important so I thought I'd let people know they moved the first game.  At least to my knowledge.<br>
<br>
Anyone know anymore about this?  Any other games been moved?  Possible effects of the move?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">lol I posted this in the other thread but ill ask it here as well. <br>
<br>
I wonder what will happen with all of our custom maps when DM gets moved to the new engine?  Will they still work?  May be a stupid question but its beyond me what if any effect there might be.  If there are problems its gona make a huge mess and we could lose a lot of really good maps....<br>
<br>
<br>
The other problem I see is that they update OB engine now like every 2-3 days.  Sometimes twice a day if they really bork something.  Its constantly messing with my TF2 pub mani/metamod Source config.  Have to reload the gamefile.txt every damn time and restart the server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">my personal thoughts...<br>
 it is likely that all valves original textures and models will be already updated (converted) for OB however any custom models, textures will need to be re-done on our side. This is just an assumption however likely it seems to me it may be different on the day.<br>
also cubemaps as well as bumps and specular layers may have issuesbut thats like saying the same thing twice: all materials needs to be updated to OB whether it be us or valves side. In a test I made Ive extracted some ep2 and portal textures and tried running them in (ep1) current DM engine  they all looked screwy and specular was totally off. I think old (even pre ep1) DM maps will be able to run on OB but (as we know) not vise versa. <br>
<br>
As for the scepticism regarding whether DM will be updated to OB or not read <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=770" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... .php?t=770</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What!? is right!  Is Valve actually planning on making a hl3dm, or is that just speculation?  If it is true that'll be the best news in online gaming I've heard since it was realeased that Blizzard were making Starcraft 2!  Oh please gaming gods let it be true!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Valve:<br>
<br>
"	Yes, the TF (Orange Box) engine is not compatible with the one that is<br>
presently used for CSS, DoDS, and HL2MP. That is why we are segregating<br>
it into the the 'orangebox' directory under the root. In the coming<br>
months the other games will be moved to the Orange Box engine and their<br>
binaries will move under the 'orangebox' directory once this move is<br>
done. The content does not need to move to the 'orangebox' when the<br>
binaries for the games move and we hope that this represents some value<br>
for server admins since you will not need to download redundant content<br>
files into two different directory structures in order to support two<br>
different engine versions.<br>
<br>
Our hope is that this new directory structure will help avoid<br>
disruptions to existing dedicated servers for other mods and products<br>
when we make significant changes to the Source engine like the ones<br>
needed for TF and the other Orange Box games. We also hope that it makes<br>
updating your servers more convenient and less bandwidth intensive as we<br>
update our games for newer engine versions.<br>
<br>
I hope this has made it more clear, but if not please let me know."<br>
<br>
"	The most significant fact here is that there have been interface changes<br>
so it is probable that many server plug-ins that work with CSS, DoD, and<br>
HL2MP will not work with the Orange Box engine. Once the beta is out the<br>
door and the initial fires are put out I will make the specific<br>
interface changes available on <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com" class="postlink">http://developer.valvesoftware.com</a> so<br>
that when the new SDK comes out the mod/plugin community can quickly<br>
make Orange Box-compatible server plugins."<br>
<br>
"The issue here is the location of the game binaries in relation to the<br>
/bin directory that contains the *correct* engine binaries. Previous to<br>
this new directory structure the assumption was that only one version of<br>
the engine could exist under a single installation. So the location of<br>
the engine binaries for all games was /bin. If you installed TF at /tf<br>
on a server that also hosts Counter-Strike Source at /cstrike then<br>
cstrike would no longer run due to the fact that the /bin directory<br>
would now have Orange Box engine binaries.<br>
<br>
So the 'orangebox' directory acts as a new root directory that has its<br>
own location for the new engine binaries and the new games that use<br>
those binaries. Meanwhile any games installed in the parent directory<br>
can still run against the old engine.<br>
<br>
For those of you that don't have more than one game installed on your<br>
dedicated server this isn't as valuable, but our goal was to make it<br>
possible to support servers that host multiple Source games that utilize<br>
multiple versions of the engine."<br>
<br>
"Right now the only game that will use the Orange Box engine is TF2. For<br>
now the other games will stay in their usual locations, but they will be<br>
moved to the new engine in the coming weeks and at that point their<br>
binaries will reside under the 'orangebox' directory.<br>
<br>
Plugins that work for the current engine version probably won't work for<br>
the new engine version but I will be sharing the new interfaces with the<br>
mod community ASAP so that they can develop new ones. The interfaces are<br>
different, but we have not eliminated functionality so rewriting the<br>
plug-ins should not be a monuental task."<br>
<br>
The Steambans plugins will not work on TF2 at this time. Until Valve releases the updated SDK, there is nothing I can do about this.<br>

There are 2 engine's structures, HL2 and HL2MP, HL2DM is just a Deathmatch mod based on HL2MP, HL2CTF is a Capture The Flag mod based on HL2MP; etc.<br>
<br>
You see? <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
Well, I wish HL2DM gets updated so we can run it at 64bits with Multi-Core support plus Hi-Res textures (if there is an option to add them -hope so-)<br>
<br>
Also, this would fix many things, but surely bring a whole new list of things to fix heh :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

eh...not seen anything new till now..<br>
so, right now we have two versions of SDK. one is ep2 and one is ep1. i'm assuming that one the above mentioned update kicks in we should be able to use both engines in one version of SDK?<br>

There is a way, you can actualy bhop faster then in half-life 2 single player, you just need to bhop backwords and you can reach speeds of over 3000 ups, same goes with portals, I love doing puzles without portals using backwords bhop hehe,<br>

Basically the orbs have a kind of black casing around them.<br>

I really hope Hl2dm doesn't go to the orange box, this game will suck so bad without bunny hopping, who knows maybe valve will do it to try to bring new players to the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well, you can get 4000 speed bhops in just ...5 hops I think. Which is even way faster than quake games speed D:<br>

To answer the other question, I have taken the HL2MP orange box sdk and compiled it to see what it feels/looks like.  There are lots of bugs in the SDK and other things that make no sense.  I have a feeling they are going way past the sdk for the actual game.<br>

I pray they aren't going to upgrade all the games at once.  Their snafus with TF2 should show them to release the games in a controlled manner.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">I TOLD YOU SO</span></strong><br>
<br>
but please continue to doubt me and cry about the orange box.<br>
<br>
<br>
on another note<br>
we can expect this<br>
- added Steamworks features, including achievements and player avatars<br>
- added Nemesis and Revenge<br>
- added Freeze Cam<br>
<br>
maybe a custom map added to stock valve map list<br>
<br>
Also some Fixes that the community bitches about see ex here<br>
- changed the algorithm for bullet spread to be more like the original Day of Defeat<br>
- reduced Garand recoil<br>
<br>
Both have been issues in the dods community since day one which i got dods on day 14<br>
<br>
told you so part (putting it in writing this time)<br>
But don't think it will happen within a year, think summer/fall  '09<br>
next they will go back to TF2 then css will get a similar update &lt;- might be in reverse but i doubt it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

They said that the orange box update would add<br>
- added Steamworks features, including achievements and player avatars<br>
- added Nemesis and Revenge<br>
- added Freeze Cam<br>
 to css/dods/hl2dm and bug fixes<br>

They said this few weeks after tf2 came out.  They never said anything about completely changing the game like some think<br>
They did change plains and set themselves back on these ob updates by coming up with the new weapons in tf2 which will likely get work on in between these betas for dods/css/hl2dm</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

From my conversations with a few people at valve, it seems that the transformation for HL2DM is more complicated than those for the other two.<br>

I am not saying that they want to deliberatly change it from what it is....but what if the new engine just hampers it just on its own, unintentionally because it wasnt meant for DM, it was meant for TF2 that runs on 800 grav.  MAYBE they are trying to tweek it so that the movement stays in DM and doesnt get messed up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yes that's more like it.<br>
basically in a compatibility update this is exactly what you do. it takes about two seconds to lay the game algorithms on the new engine code then forever to make the two work as a one comprehensive (and as much as pos - bug free) for the end user = gamer.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

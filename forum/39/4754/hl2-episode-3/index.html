I know they introduced it at E3 last year and there was reportedly some concept art around somewhere, but I havent seen anything else about it in the gaming mags I read.  Find it odd that in the time that Valve were supposidly working on Ep 3, they put out L4D and L4D2.   So ????</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So much for episodic releases being faster.  Wonder if its even worth their time at this point or if anyone will care anymore when they do get around to releasing it.

it won't make a difference anyways i guess, unlike 3d realms, valve is actually making money on other titles and pretty much has the pc digital content distribution market cornered with steam.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, as far as I'm concerned, that's bad news. I won't buy any new rigs just because of them...<br>
<br>
<br>
But there's one thing I agreed with Gabe Newell when I saw some video of him where he said "We will take the time needed to provide the players with something worthy, instead of rushing some ideas to feed their hunger faster".<br>
He used some diferent words but he ment just that. I honestly prefer to wait for the games for as long as it takes for them to make them as worthwhile as all the previous ones were.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> HL title is one that deserves cherish and love to be made.

<br>
The new characters do nothing for me --&gt; Coach is just meaningless, Rochelle is a stupid whore, Ellis is a dumbfounded bogan and Nick (although he is the best out of the lot) doesn't have that much character. In fact every one of the characters you cannot relate to at all: and have no distinguished personalities. <br>
<br>
The gameplay isn't much better either. I hate the idea of a 'defibulator'. If they are dead they are dead, like c'mon (but getting stuck in cupboards didn't make much sense either). <br>
<br>
The only thing better in L4D2 is the gore of the meele weapons incapitating the zomgies and throwing boomer bile at tanks and witches.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, Half Life 2 has been updated (maybe not to orange box, but still has diferent gamplay now). After playing a bit, my suspicions were confirmed and the bhop allowance is now gone from the single player version. I have yet to notice other changes.<br>
There's no big issue about it in my opinion, although it can take the fun from some people who like bhop even in the single player games, but it's taken as a bad sign in my personal undertanding. Watching how valve has been making all of their multiplayer games with no possibilies for bunny hopping, and now the single player version of hl2dm is restricted in the same way, I'd say 2 + 2 = 4. I mean, if they touch HL2dm it will be ruined...<br>
<br>
Now, some of you may say they won't touch this game no matter what. I honestly don't know. But since every other game is being ported into OB, I don't see why they would leave this one out.<br>
<br>
Now, <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline">just in case they do it, and in case they brake the gameplay as we know it and love it</span></strong>, I'm asking for your help. I want to be ready with this if it's needed. I hope it will not be needed, but...<br>
<br>
I want to gather all possible links to everything that shows how HL2dm has been played along the years, be it tutorials, frag movies, mods like HL2dm:OB or AG2, whatever you may think that shows it, I want to gather it. My goal is to make a huge list of evidence to show valve what they are taking away from the community, and to show them how they are breaking the extreme competitive potential of this game. Plus, they will be ruining years and years of work from community members that dedicated countless hours of their lives to create everything we know, from dm maps to jump maps, from training movement techniques and strategies to creating this website with guides and helpful thoughts, and dedicating many hours to helping other people, teaching them, etc etc etc. This list will be posted in every forums I know and possibly every website/blog I can reach with it. It hopefully will work as a big shout that will hopefully be noticed.<br>
<br>
If anyone has other or better ideas of actions to take, discuss them or go for it. I will keep my plan going anyway, even if anyone say it's useless. Everything is useless when you don't try it, and the more useless things you try at once, the more they all become noticed and useful. So I'm on it, no matter what.<br>
<br>
I will update this thread to include all links I know and that you guys may help me gather.<br>
Thanks everyone that helps.<br>

	<div class="content">Edited my 1st post to reflect what Valar told. It is not OB.<br>
<br>
Why morbid? I'm just being precautious to my own feelings. I'm worried about this ever since I started playing this and noticed how Valve was approaching all their multiplayer games and I thought it was some luck that they have abandoned this one. Now I'm thinking that if they touch it, it will be hl2dm's end, at least for me. I think I'm being realistic at most.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Depends dewd, probably not if the guy (whats his face) whose idea it was to create (and headed the project) has anything to do with it.<br>
Also the fact that they left it wen they did the fios update (and even made the movement different in feel) means they could allready accept it as is.<br>
Im not saying that it couldnt hapen, and considering the trend it is possible that they could fuck it but i think its more likely that dm comes out with little affect to movement.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

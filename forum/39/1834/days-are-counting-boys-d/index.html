<br>
Yeah, I don't like DoDS (/me is old DoD 1.x player) but I must admit that they did a great job with this Source2007 thing. <br>
<br>
Score is the same as TF2. You have Achievements and physics/textures/effects updates.<br>
<br>
Plus, that zoom camera when you got kill is awesome (can't wait to see it in HL2DM/CSS).<br>

That would be cool, but also a damper in competitive play (yeah, it'd be disabled in such play, but until I can go 12 hours without farting.......such things are irrelevant in my book).<br>

There are cvars to remove it in tf2 so I would assume it could be removed in dm if they were to add it. I doubt hl2dm will ever make it to the OB. If you look at the dm code, it's a real mess. Hell, there isnt even code for team collisions lol. They would have to recode so much that Im betting they will figure it not to be worth the hassle.

There is way to much already done to the code to port it over and redoing the whole thing from scratch will take a very long time to do and our coder, who is working for free, isnt about to take on that task. As much as I would like it to be on the latest sdk, it's not going to happen. Even our old coder wasnt about to attempt porting the 1.7 code to a newer sdk. It was quicker to start from scratch, which took him over 6 months to get 1.8 toware it was when he left. We have taken a lot of steps to get this version up to snuff so you arent going to notice to many downfalls from it still being on the older sdk.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The hitboxes were bugged, they are fixed now. FOV is also locked in dm and Im sure it is for more reasons then 1. Our main issue is that it screws up the weapon models/muzzleflash. Walljump will continue to take away aux, but there will be something added so players can still walljump all they want.

11:21 PM - [≈$W≈] LukeGT421: what im talking about is how the smoke tracks from the smg nade to you wherever you are<br>
11:21 PM - [≈$W≈] LukeGT421: makes it really hard to dodge them haha<br>
11:21 PM - {EE} The New Guy™: all I have seen is a extra animation for the smoke, and it makes morons like Nervous think the curve of the nade is different<br>

11:23 PM - [≈$W≈] LukeGT421: the smoke pivots on the smg nade<br>
11:23 PM - {EE} The New Guy™: the particle crap stuff, I assume<br>
11:24 PM - [≈$W≈] LukeGT421: and it looks like it is always coming for you or leaving from you<br>

11:25 PM - {EE} The New Guy™: as I said, "you would"<br>
11:25 PM - {EE} The New Guy™: I am pretty sure I found it pretty, the moving animations, but if you are looking to see where it will land I guess its annoying<br>

Yo!<br>
<br>
Any Linux server had that issue back in the day. It was because Linux servers thought they were Source 2009, but the mod is Source 2007. That can be fixed. Deetz on <a href="http://molesterland.net/guides/hl2mpob_on_gameservers/" class="postlink">http://molesterland.net/guides/hl2mpob_on_gameservers/</a>.<br>
<br>
Also, there's a Steam Community group for anyone interested in obtaining/troubleshooting/discussing the mod. Right hurr: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hl2dmob" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hl2dmob</a>. The mod is NOT hard to install, you do NOT have to redownload (or copy) all your maps to use it and it is so goddam smooth. Recommend.<br>
<br>
A few fine folks including myself frequently play on Molester Land (8.2.121.172). The password is usually "jessica".<br>

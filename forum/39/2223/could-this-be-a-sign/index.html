CS-online is made by an asian company with valve's approval, CSO has the same graphics and gameplay as cs:cz, the only things that are different are that you don't need steam for it and everything is in Chinese,Japanese ,etc..<br>
<br>
And imo this isn't a sign, Valve's too busy with updating cs:s.<br>
You also have cspromod, wich was the biggest fail i've ever seen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Incorrect, the support of Pro mod is great, every time one of the S-UK guys has reported a bug there's been a fix for it.<br>

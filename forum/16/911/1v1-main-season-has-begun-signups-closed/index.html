	<div class="content">The 1v1 main season has kicked off. The default match time this season is each Tuesday at 9:00 PM EST, with playoffs running twice weekly on Tuesday and Saturday. Check the schedules or your match sidebar for week-1 match listings.<br>
<br>
All players who had either a forfeit loss or an unreported match during the preseason have been set to inactive status. PM the 1v1 division manager listed on the CAL-HL2DM admin sidebar if you were purged and wish to be reactivated; however, note that this priviledge is only available once, and players who are purged a second time due to inactivity will not be readmitted to the division until the season is over.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

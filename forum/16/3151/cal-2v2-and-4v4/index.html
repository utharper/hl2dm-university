Just as a reminder/suggestion to teams.  Its a good idea to cross reference the people you are playing with their team roster to make sure there are no ringers or that they dont have a suspended player playing.<br>
<br>
For example this team: <br>
<a href="http://www.caleague.com/?page=teams&amp;teamid=195105" class="postlink">http://www.caleague.com/?page=teams&amp;teamid=195105</a><br>
<br>
I had to schedule them because they have enough people without the suspended player.  I have warned them that if he attempts to play, both he and the team will be suspended.  Being in a server with the team they are scheduled against will be assumed as an attempt to play.  If he does, take a screen shot of the console with everyone's steam IDs and send it to me please.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

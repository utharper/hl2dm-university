	<div class="content">If 2 players have a match and one wins the first map then ties the second. Then the match is over and that player wins. We get a couple of these every season and some people seem to be spreading info that it goes to a tie breaker but how can that be since if it went to a tie breaker it could result in a new tie? <br>
<br>
Also when different maps are played for rounds you cannot do any sort of summed scores to determine tie breakers. Because some maps are smaller everyone would just focus on winning them. Say LukeGT421 beats me 40 -20 on tigcrick and I win zeta 18-0 he would end up winning simply because he chose to work with the map which is smaller and nets more frags. This give unfair weight to smaller maps where frags can be obtained quicker and leads can be advanced easier.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I for one never liked this rule at all, although<br>
I completely understand the point about not summing the frags in the case of a tie.<br>
<br>
I have seen a few players get (screwed IMO) by this rule in the following scenario, first round match goes 8-7 or some very close score, second round match goes 10-10. Now in my eyes a clear cut winner has not been shown as winning by 1 point in most cases can be a matter of luck or the result of some glitch or bug (we all know it happens ie; getting stuck in a wall or ceiling ect and having to suicide or w/e hmm drift comes to mind).<br>
<br>
Being that rounds are only 15 mins I see no harm in playing a 3rd round and even a 4th round if necessary to get beyond a tie so that a player can actually show that he can win 2 rounds, not win one and tie another, that just seems cheesy to me.<br>
The chances of having a tie 3 rounds in a row is gonna be slim to none and would really show someone can win more than just one round.<br>
<br>
I vote to change this rule and discard ties completely and play until a player has won 2 rounds. <br>
<br>
Does anyone else who is playing in CAL 1v1 think this would be more fair? I have been told in the past that if the majority of players asked for something it would be considered.<br>

Onti, there are cases where in CAL's rules a winner is decided after only two rounds, and thats my point it is not fair that way.<br>
So in actuality it is a best of two at that point and a player has actually only WON one round and tied another.<br>
<br>
I already know the only reason someone would object to discarding a tie and continuing until a player wins two rounds is that there would be a possibility of playing for up to 1 hr in extreme cases. My response to that in advance is who says you have to play all the rounds in one sitting? If both players agreed you could always come back later or the next day and continue if need be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Also, to clarify: The 3rd round is only to be used if the players round wins are tied after 2 rounds (1:1, or 0:0 in the very unusual case of double ties).<br>

Considering it almost came down to this last season, yeah, and it's not lame at all. in fact, it happened in season2. I don't really see a problem with the rule. A victory is a victory, no matter if it was 8-7 or 20-7, for cal anyway. <br>
<br>
Yes the 8-7 can be decided by luck but that's the risk you take by playing such a slow strategy, and how are more maps going to solve the problem? If it nearly happened twice in a row (with the 8-7 example) then more than likely you're already so equal it's going to come down to luck in the later rounds anyway (unless someone actually starts playing fast and turns a low-frag match into a medium to high frag match, lessening the effect of bad spawns and stuff)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thats easy to say when your on the winning end of it, however I highly doubt you would feel the same if you were on the losing end of that deal.<br>
 If you were on the losing end of it, like most players you would be feeling like you were robbed. See a tie by definition is just that a *tie* neither player was better than the other they were equal, so why just hand it off to one player?<br>
<br>
If this game were perfect and glitches and bugs were not part of the equation then it wouldn't be so bad. When you consider that someone can train all season and then lose like this it just doesn't seem right as it could have been caused by a glitch or bug. Winning just one round doesn't mean much if you can back it up.<br>
<br>
If anyone is wondering I have never been in this situation, but I have seen quite a few who were and I just think it's wrong.<br>
<br>
So for the people who have commented against it, what is your valid reason? So far I haven't heard one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

"If you were on the losing end of it, like most players you would be feeling like you were robbed. See a tie by definition is just that a *tie* neither player was better than the other they were equal, so why just hand it off to one player?"<br>
<br>
well the previous round someone lost and someone won, someone had to have won, generally this means they're better. luck happens, it's your job to make sure it doesn't affect you as much (I changed my entire gamestyle in-between seasons to counter this for instance, but I doubt anyone even noticed/cares considering I rarely 1v1 at all)<br>
<br>
"If this game were perfect and glitches and bugs were not part of the equation then it wouldn't be so bad.

<br>
if someone is really training the entire season then they should have learned (or at least soon will, if they run into the type of event you describe) how to make luck have less of an effect on the match overall. then again bad things can happen but you just have to take a break and go back at it some other time</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Keep reading Punk,  <br>
<br>
Now tell me how in the hell is it not fair for the person that scored more points then the other to win?<br>
<br>
I thought of this post while waiting to spawn on aim_arena while i was winning with 7 seconds left. And only winning by one point.  I spawned close but was able to keep moving and stay alive.  This happen in our match it was 8-7 and you looked at the other spawn point as i spawned 2 feet to your right. I slowly moved behind you grabbed the shotgun and waited as long as i could (about 5 seconds left) then engaged with the shotty.<br>
<br>
<br>
"(we all know it happens ie; getting stuck in a wall or ceiling ect and having to suicide or w/e hmm drift comes to mind)."  <br>
<br>
Luck? no I am pretty sure that if you practiced you would know about this and if it happens to you, then yes you deserve to die.  What about on avalon you could jusr get a lot of fall damage and suicide?  But same thing you should know each fall can cost 10 hp so don't do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact is,  The Tie doesn't give an advantage to either player so then it goes to the other round Which if one player won then that gives them the advantage.   That just makes sense.  As i said in my first post, this also happen in 2v2 which is total frags.  So basicly after the first round it was tied 56-56 going into the second round,  It was winner takes all.  And OMG it was caverns_r1 you could get stuck in the sewer mouth omg no!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Your just a barrel of LOL's now <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>
<br>
Per the CAL rules as of today this is how it reads:<br>
<br>
    3.60 Calling the Match<br>
<br>
    Regulation matches consist of a total of 3 rounds, with the winner being the player with the most round wins at the end of the match. If there is a tie after three rounds the match will be counted as a tie. Under no circumstances should a player leave the server before all rounds have been completed. If a player does leave before match completion, the leaving player will be deemed to forfeit.<br>
<br>
Ok,<br>
So even though the admins are calling this something other than what it says, my point as it has been since the beginning is that how can you rightly say there is a winner if only two rounds have been played? The rules as they have always stated say and I quote " Regulation matches consist of a total of 3 rounds"<br>
<br>
This does not mean two rounds it means three, so I guess were going back to STA days where admins can make the rules out to be something other than what they clearly say. So for 3 seasons now players who were declared losers after only getting to play two rounds were getting screwed as they still had a chance to make a tie by winning in the third round. This is not my opinion it is what the rules say exactly, I'd love to see anyone prove it means something otherwise. I quote again " If there is a tie after three rounds the match will be counted as a tie."<br>
<br>
It is my belief that this rule was written for a reason, and that is simple; in order for a player to show he is better he must be able to beat another player more than once. Think of the NBA they play a series of games to determine a champion, why do you think that is how it is? The reason is because Basketball games can go either way very easy much in the same way this game of hl2dm can, many times games end by one basket (or in our case one frag). So they play a series of games to determine who is better. Games cannot be decided by a tie in basketball and they should not here or in any competitive sport for that matter, as a tie does not show superiority it shows equality.<br>
<br>
For one it's ridiculous that CAL is allowing the rules to say one thing while something else is being enforced.<br>
Secondly if you want CAL to be modeled after other professional sports you take ties out of the scenario especially when you are playing a series of rounds to determine who is stronger.<br>
<br>
One round win does NOT show superiority.<br>
One round win and one tie still does not show superiority, not here and not in any other professional sport that uses a series format.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>1v1 League Match Format <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">The HL2DM 1v1 League will be using a best-of-3 rounds format, as follows</span>:<br>
<br>
First round, the away player chooses a map from the list. The round is played on the home player's server, with total frags determining the round winner. Second round, play switches to the away player's server and the home player selects their map of choice; again, total frags decide the round winner.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Should each player win a round</span>, a tiebreaking 3rd round using the same format as rounds 1 and 2 will be played on the home player's server, using the predetermined weekly league map.<br>
<br>
The player that wins 2 rounds, or has the most round wins after 3 rounds are completed, wins the match. Note that frag totals are only used to determine round winners and have no effect on the overall match score. To clarify, if a player wins the 1st round 50:0, then loses the 2nd round 9:10, the match total is 1:1 and a 3rd round must be played.<br>
<br>
The timelimit for each round is 15 minutes, with the option of a 5 minute break between rounds.<br>
<br>
The default match time/day in the 1v1 division is Tuesday at 9:00 PM EST.<br>
<br>
A full rules listing for the League is available in the CAL main site HL2DM 1v1 section. </div></blockquote>

<br>
So as Fearsome stated:  If one player wins one round and the next ties a third round could cause yet another tie.  You are only supposed to go to a 3rd round if the two first rounds end up in a 1:1.   If one player wins one round and the second is tied then its a 1:0.  Two rounds were played, one round was won so by default the winner of the one round wins.   If the tied round is thrown out, and the third round goes to a overall tie (1:1), then a fourth must be played which would cause a rather lengthy match.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Paradox thanks for repeating that, except I already know this. I have been talking about this for 3 seasons now and right or wrong if thats how fearsome wants to run it, what would be so hard about updating the official rules to reflect that?<br>
Saying it in IRC or posting it on any forum is not Official rules and is the reason people get confused, because they go to look at the CAL rules when they want to know what the rule is.<br>
<br>
I did some research and for the record other money tournaments are not done in this manner, they are done by sudden death when a tie occurs. Given a choice I would prefer another round and not sudden death but apparently having a choice is not a option.<br>
<br>
Currently quakecon 2008 is having a 12,500 tournament and the rules for that are yet to be posted, will be interesting to see what they do this year since last year it was sudden death. Thank god someone running a tournament somewhere has the brains to see that a tie isn't worth anything.<br>
<br>
 I furthermore do not understand why anyone would object to playing another round as most of the players are sitting at there pc for hours on end anyway and we are talking about no more than one hour here, not two not three but one hour.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

    * Player's scores will be tallied by calculating frags minus suicides, where the remaining value is the player's official score.<br>
    * In the case of a tied score at the end of the regular fifteen (15) minute time period an overtime period of two (2) minutes will be added to the clock for Quake 2-4 round and three (3) minutes for QuakeWorld rounds.<br>
          o In the case of a tied score after a single overtime period, additional overtime periods will be added to the clock in two (2) or three (3) minute intervals as required until a winner is determined<br>
    * For each Group play round, the higher scoring player of the game is the winner, and will be awarded 1 point.<br>
    * For best of 3 matches, the match winner will be the player who wins 2 individual rounds.<br>
          o The winner is decided by the player with the higher score at the end of the round.<br>
          o If after the two rounds, the result is a tie, a tiebreaker game &amp; map will be played. The tie breaker game &amp; map will be determined by the SLANT randomizer from the 2 remaining games.<br>

Seagull, I appreciate your input into this thread but your making hypothetical situations which in general do not occur (ie; 90:10 and then a tie) from what I have seen the cases that this applies to have been very close in score and therefore true superiority has not been shown. The purpose of CAL is for players to find out who is the better player and have fun doing so. Losing matches and or championships over a rule which is not considered the <em class="text-italics">standard format</em> in 1v1 FPS leagues and tournaments is defeating the original purpose because its basing the winner off of one insignificant win, and taking all the fun out of it for the player who is feeling screwed over by some lame rule which is not used anywhere that I can find.<br>
<br>
I only brought this up again because I am the type of person who likes to see things be totally fair to all involved and I also believe that things like rules should be enforced as written.<br>
<br>
I have to disagree with you on the fact that quake is any different than hl2dm, both games have fast movement and both games have spawn kills and weapons that are one shot kills, which makes them pretty similar.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah these are good examples and far from a blow out or total domination's like you described, esp considering they are rocket control maps on the ones where the winning player won by less than 10 points. These examples just bring another fault with the current system to light. On small rocket control maps you can get repeatedly spawn raped by rpgs and that can be very hard to overcome.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

???<br>
<br>
First link: 28-22. map = tigcrik a win by 6 frags<br>
Second link: 17-9. map = biohazard a win by 8 frags<br>
Third link: 23:15. map = tigcrik. a win by 8 frags<br>
<br>
they aren't a total blow out or dominated but they are rarely determined by luck when the gap is that far apart. the only one that's a rocket control map is biohazard, and that's generally somewhat fast paced (at least in that specific match it seems it was, decent number of frags there for bio) and for tigcrik those are both decently sized leads that can hardly be determined by luck (tig is a very item-control based map more than others when you can control the *entire* map heh). sure small rocket control maps you can be owned by rpg with bad spawns, but then again that's just bad luck and will happen under any system. then again you can always just suicide ggun nade on the guy for breaking his control (most of the time) unless you're getting really really bad bad spawns. like spawning next to the guy in an open area vs spawning next to him in an area where you can at least attempt to dodge and get a nade off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Everyone that plays this game has that one map that they really like to play and showcases their talents the best. For me last season, this map was aim_arena.

IN FACT, adding a third match only increases the randomness that you are trying to avoid. Becasue what if its aim_arena again.

How is that fair? <br>
It's fair because you beat him twice and with out a doubt you were the better player in that match.<br>
If it wasn't fair every single league like twl, tgl, ogl, cevo, sta, quakeconn ect would not be doing it that way.<br>
<br>
It is the players responsibility to make sure he can play every map on this list to the best of his ability and not just rely on one map to guarantee at least one win.<br>

I found no 1v1 leagues on any of these sites (I could have missed something though because I didn't check every single game).

Playing a 3rd match has a serious potential to unfairly handicap the person who is ahead 1:0. The most reasonable solution seems to be to prevent the ties from happening in the first place. Sudden death wouldn't work because it would depend too much on random spawns. Overtime sounds good though. Keep adding time in increments of 3 minutes untill someone comes out on top. The looser can't complian, and it makes it a true best 2 out of 3. Idk if this is even possible though...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It would take about two mins to write a overtime.cfg and if a regulation round ends in a tie the overtime.cfg could be exec'd to have overtime rounds of 3-5 minutes (whatever is deemed most fair by the community) on the same map that was tied on.<br>

This would solve all the problems, the ill feelings, and once and for all show a truly superior player at the end of the match.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
dods, css, hl2dm has always been like that.  If it's total frags or matches one tie and one loss doesn't equal a tie<br>
<br>
Unless there is real tie overtime isn't needed. It's not 2 of 3.  It's total rounds after 2 matches.  Quake/doom has Sudden death where everything is a fresh spawn and it's 1st kill.  But once 0.00 comes up on the clock a round restart isn't possible, and playing for the first kill would be the best option but not worth it imo.  But we can't use quake maps why should we use quake rules?<br>
<br>
Only true ties are when You win a round and I win a round.  Or if both rounds are tied. 1:1 or 0:0.  1:0 someone proved they are better.  It's about not wasting time. People don't wanna be sitting around forever when someone proved that they are better.  Thats the reason 4v4 and 2v2 are back to total frags.  Not reason for that overtime round when the score was 148 to 100 1st round and then 135 to 136.  The first team is better on that day.  30 minutes for 1v1 matches and 40 minutes for 2v2,4v4 is plenty of time.  If the match is close the randomness is taken out as a factory by time each person is bound to have a bad spawn or two and it always evens out in 15 minutes.<br>

It is the way the league does it and is the correct interpretation as the league just revised the rules to show this.  <br>

I understand its a technicality based on the wording "best of three" but since a draw is worth something points wise in the grand scheme of things (seeding for playoffs) it just seems that players should get the opportunity to play 3 rounds and at least get that chance to have a draw.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Ok L2K I see your point, I always have but there ideal and real and we need to live in real. Currently valve has no good problem free way to doing a sudden death or extended Tie breaker and with the technical difficulties that we already seem to have it seems unlikely we could get most of these players to do a more complicated system of starting a new match or trying to extend time just before the match ends. I have always had a goal of keeping matches under 1 hour so that we dont have players needing to go away in the middle of matches. 1v1 pulls this off in a max of 3 15 minute rounds. If we were talking a major even like the stanly cup then yes we would probably do a best of 7 matches on 7 different maps but here we need to deal with reality people who are not paid to play and have lives outside of the game and probably cannot hang around for the extra time. I now see the rules are not explicit what we practice in 1v1 is a Best of 3. And I guess in my entire life it seemed obvious that you don't really have to play all 3 matches if you win 2 it is over and if you win 1 and tie the next it is over. Why would I do the more dangerous solution of taking something where we had a Tie broken and introduce the chance to tie it back up and then have to go back and create a 2nd tie breaking system. I also agree with seagull that a short tie breaker round is much more luck based then the current system. In every match this season against a decent opponent I started in the hole with a bad start and in many I was able to take it back or on my way to winning most of the time it was bad spawns the other guy spawned in zeta or near a better weapon and then took the early lead and in 3 or 5 minutes I would have lost just on luck. I also think you should go explain this to some admins of other leagues and see what they say cause I think that they would not force a team to play extra rounds if the winner seemed to be already figured out. All of their rules may be just as bad as ours. <br>
<br>
If you can come up with a better system that can keep the match under an hour and not result in extra ties then let us know. Also the only way I see really getting over your problem is to introduce some sort of system where you have to win by a certain percentage or by a number of points like tennis or something. But once again we are just introducing the chance that matches could never get out of a tie or drag out for hours. Yes luck happens but if you stay around from season to season the mass average of you skill will show and the best player always make it with in 2 positions of the spot they should be in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Concerning the rule about ties. When we wrote that we intended for it to address regular season play in which say in 4v4 2 teams perfectly tied like 56-89 and 89- 56 scores in that case we just left it as a tie. And the same for 1v1 if I win round 1, your win round 2 and we tie round 3 then it is just a tie. However what we do in the playoffs I dont even know if that is spelled out and it needs to be as well. But my thinking was never meant to allow a clear win to be thrown back into the situation of a clear tie. IE I win round 1 you and I tie round 2 then we play round 3 and you win. <br>
<br>
In fact I am sure alot of this is even ambiguous. but the thing is we have to draw the line somewhere there's always luck the only way to overcome it is to just crush your opponent so hard that even if he is the luckiest man on earth he cannot over come it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Your opinion, I have no problem getting more than one kill per minute esp on small maps.<br>

<em class="text-italics">Winning</em>by one point was never the issue at hand here as long as the player had won two rounds. What was the issue was that it was supposed to be a best of 3 and in some case a best of 2 was being used. This did not conform to the offical rules as they were written. If anything good has come of this thread at least that is fixed now.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Paradox wrote:</cite>This is HL2DM.  Its not Quake or any other game.  We do not have to conform to other tournament rules.</div></blockquote>

I never said you had to conform to be like other games. Ko-Tao said that CAL was doing it just like those games in respect to allowing a tie to decide a win. I just proved that wrong, and said that the generally accepted method was to make a player win two games.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Paradox wrote:</cite>The league can not be run by opinion because like assholes everyone has one and there would never be agreement on anything.  We do the best we can and we can't make everyone happy.</div></blockquote>

Sure some of what I have argued is based on my opinion, but it is only because the current system is flawed and as I stated I believe the league should be fair for all and not just benefit a select few. This is the major flaw and some people just are too inept to see it or even care but it exists none the less. I can use give you a real life example based on something that has happened this season.<br>
Herb lost a match by 6 points on a tiny little map that is highly prone to spawn kills (tig) then he ties on another tiny map (aim) now due to this rule and the fact that he was not given the opportunity to play a third round which he <em class="text-italics">could</em> have possibly won, he walked away with only 2 points for the loss. If he had played the third round and won he could have walked away with 3 points for the draw.<br>
 At the end of the regular season when all the points were tallied to see who makes the playoffs, having one less point if you were about 8th in the standings could prevent you from making the playoffs, now is that fair when it is supposed to be a best of three format and not a best of two? This system could also mean the difference between playing the top seed or the second or third in the first round of playoffs. While its true we have something called RPI, that would only come into play if the points were tied. So you see it may be my opinion that this system is flawed, but it is a opinion which is based on facts and again in my opinion is a stronger argument than saying if a OT round was done, it would likely be decided by spawn kills.<br>

The point of any league is to hold a competition out of which there are winners and losers. That is our ultimate goal. What you are calling for is a league where more ties is better and you think that that is better or less flawed then the current system? I would like you to logically think through every step of the process and decide who is the better player and deserves the win. I think unless you just have some odd bias or personal bad experience you will come to the decision that what we have now is the fairest option available. I personally have worked through them all and I find no problem with the current solution. I find it is most the most fair we can come up with besides adding a sudden death or short addition to the tied round both of which create new problems and layers of complication and are not supported by the games current code. Which quite frankly is not what we want to do when teams still can't seem to set up Source TVs and servers right yet. <br>
<br>
The part that disturbs me is the comment about the current system benefiting a select few. Who are the select few and how does it benefit them? Is there some way that the current rules favors someone like me? Please explain that. <br>
<br>
In my match Confused lost on his own map and tied on mine. He recieved the better spawn in zeta and controlled the rocket first, he lost the position and tried to run and hide, he lost the lead and it came down to a tie because he did not bother to rush electing instead to stay outside cause someone misinterpreted his explanation and said it would goto a tie breaker. I think it is perfectly fair that he was beat hands down in that situation. In herbs situation I do not know who's map was who's but I know he was unable to win in his home map in either case and therefore deserved the loss. Going on to the third map will cause a possible tie when we did not have one why you think this is better still baffles me. But lets say you feel luck was the reason for the first maps win. IMO going to the third map will introduce more luck. After all what if that map is the other players home map, what if it is the first players home map? Will that not give an unfair advantage to one player or other other? What if the map just has a particular style advantage such as long range or short range which caters to 1 player over the other? My point is simple, in close games it is always going to come down to luck adding the third map to a 1-0 situation possibly making it 1-1 just does not seem to make any logical sense to me. If you cannot win on your own map then why do you deserve to goto another round?<br>
<br>
There are currently only 2 rare ways to end up with a tie in the current CAL. <br>
1 player wins a round, the other wins the second and they tie the third. Rare but likely<br>
Both players Tie all 3 round. About as likely as winning the lottery.<br>
<br>
Anyhow I really think this argument has gone off base or is just spinning out of control. But just to see what the opinions of players are I want to hold a vote I can understand how things like map selection could be heavily opinionated but this one should not be. It should just be a logical decision. The only possible way I could see it as being corrupt is if I was wavering from one side to the other and admins were changing the rules depending on who would or would not win. But that has not happened as said my stand has always been the same since the start.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hmm that is kind of a tricky one. Looks to me that a rules update would clear it up (sorry if this has already been done and I'm just beating a dead horse). It seems like the logical thing to do to make it easiest to understand is that a player must win 2 rounds. In the event that a 2nd round ends up in a tie, you add a designated amount of overtime (lets say 5 mins). If the winner of the first round comes out ahead after the 5 mins, grats, he/she deserved to win. If the player who lost the first round wins the 2nd, he/she has earned that final 3rd round. I realize that the argument could be made the loser of the first had his/her chance in the 2nd round, but it does not prove the winner could get it done as well. <br>
<br>
That being said, with the current rules in place, I cannot see allowing a 3rd round to be played in the event of a 1st round win and a 2nd round tie.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What you are calling for is a league where more ties is better and you think that that is better or less flawed then the current system? I would like you to logically think through every step of the process and decide who is the better player and deserves the win. I think unless you just have some odd bias or personal bad experience you will come to the decision that what we have now is the fairest option available. I personally have worked through them all and I find no problem with the current solution. I find it is most the most fair we can come up with besides adding a sudden death or short addition to the tied round both of which create new problems and layers of complication and are not supported by the games current code. Which quite frankly is not what we want to do when teams still can't seem to set up Source TVs and servers right yet.</div></blockquote>

<br>
1. I don't think more ties are better, but given that it's supposed to be a best of three and there are points to be gained by getting a tie, then yes I think you need to give that opportunity and if a tie occurs during regular season then so be it, playoffs should go until there is a winner. When this thread first started the rules were still really poorly written and it really could be interpreted the wrong way even though you had made intentions clear in other venues. <br>
<br>
2. We are talking about a very small percentage of matches that this will effect, and albeit a small percentage I think fair is fair and it should be considered because there is also a small percentage of players who will be negatively affected by it, as it is now.<br>
<br>
3. I really don't think having a overtime.cfg would be that difficult for people to grasp, if they can upload and exec the cal1v1.cfg they could do this as well if 3 mins is too short make it 5, alot can happen in 5 mins.<br>
<br>
4. I have never lost a match this way, but when I see what happened to Herb, I can understand how I would be extremely frustrated at losing that match and not having a real shot at overcoming some BS that may have occurred. His opponent's home map was tig, and there are places you can stand on tig and easily rack up 6 spawn kills in a row, sometimes more and there really isnt anything you can do about it. I have played plenty of tig with Ace, PB, Ninjins and Divinty and a host of other players to know thats true. Maybe Seagull has some special trick to get out of that, but most players don't. So in a nutshell when your looking at that particular match and you take into consideration it could have been won on a streak of spawn kills do you honestly think that would show who was better or just that who got luckier with a streak of spawn kills? Does a player really deserve to win a match based on more spawn kills, does that showcase skill?<br>
Like I said in one of the first posts with a game like this where you have the potential for bugs, glitches, and spawn kill streaks I really think you have to give ample opportunities to overcome that to both players, and 2 rounds just doesn't IMO.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Fearsome* wrote:</cite>The part that disturbs me is the comment about the current system benefiting a select few. Who are the select few and how does it benefit them? Is there some way that the current rules favors someone like me? Please explain that.</div></blockquote>

<br>
This may be hard for me to explain the way I see it but it seems like some very top tier players would benefit by only having to win one round and not be totally tested or totally prove themselves against another top tier player. As Seagull stated it is very taxing to play more rounds and perhaps that is his and others weakness. You have guys who are putting in enormous hours <em class="text-italics">conditioning</em> themselves for that big match and when you consider that a lot of top players won't give a 1v1 outside of CAL, I think CAL owes it to these players to play more rounds if a tie within two were to occur. Again it all comes down to negating all the BS that can happen and showing you got what it takes to WIN twice, be it twice over 3 or twice over 3 and OT.<br>

I never said CAL was corrupt or meant to imply that, even though I have complained about this rule in the past and the way the rules were worded, that has just now been fixed and no one should get that impression now. I think the CAL admins are doing a great job and I know it is a lot of work and takes time out of your life to do. The only thing that could make hl2dm in CAL any better is if you listened to the players more, and let them be part of the decision making process to some extent when it comes to maps and rules ect.<br>
<br>
I think I'm pretty much done with this thread now, I've said all I have to say and its starting to get repetitive but I felt like I had to answer your questions. If anyone else wants to state their opinions after taking everything into consideration that would be great. I find it funny that more than a few people have complained to me about this over the last few seasons knowing I was previously a CAL admin, but have yet to post anything about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The opponent is not a variable you can change only the score. As in my 1:0 match vs dallas brought my rpi up and his down.  Bahlk dropped my rpi down a lot for going to overtime with what is now a bye.  But again not something that is in my hands.<br>

Reading news on local wrestlers at nationals this past weekend a local wrestler won Nationals on a tie.  In Freestyle/Greco it is round based 2 of 3,  If one of the first 2 rounds are tied they add 30 seconds (1/4th of the total round time).  If it's a Tie in the 3rd round which the final match was, The win goes to the person to scored the last point. The national finals match scores were 7-4, 0-2, 1-1.  Although as with most leagues 1:0 isn't possible, unless it's total frags which rounds don't count anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think the more you look at different sports and games that are played with a best of 3, the more you will see that do something like this.<br>

This example sounds fair and would mean we should add 4 mins if we followed it, as 3.75 would  be 1/4 of the round time for us.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Big cheese as you say how are you going to add time? Extending the map assumes you can enter the command to extend the time just 1 second before the time runs out or it needs the system implemented by valve. If the time is close and you enter the command then a kill happens who knows. This goes back to my point about reality. If there was an easy valve implemented solution we would use it and make sure ties did not happen. (well maybe people can still do alot to make them happen). But if not why worry we already have the tie broken? Right now maybe you guys can email valve asking for a tie breaking function to be added to all rounds would be useful i think.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm just brainstorming here. This would only work if it was fully automated. If someone actually had to enter stuff into console during the match there's no way in hell it would work. I have no knowledge of how configs work or what their capable of, but there's plenty of people here that are and I'd like to get some input from them.

Thanks Rev for that input, more or less that is how we have it in CAL right now with the exception of the 5 minute overtime in the event of a tie in the third round (which only makes sense to me)<br>
<br>
How does CU handle a situation like this?<br>
Player one wins round 1 with a score of  lets say 10-8<br>
Player one and player two tie on round 2 with a score of lets say 10-10<br>
Is a third round and or a fourth round then played (if needed) in CU to make a player actually win 2 times to be declared a winner of the match, or is one round win and a tie considered good enough to declare a winner after only 2 rounds?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

or when you didn't want to include lockdown at all in the rotation, and yeah wanna tell me how many other times we have seen a finals map not named lockdown if i recall, swamplight was the finals map in the last season of sta: another ninojman special <img src="http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/3281/iconrolleyesvz7.gif" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
i remember it had to be voted in a poll over whatever shit map it was you put in instead, fortunately the community isn't retarded</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">I like it as it is. 3 round is just way too long. We all know shit can happen in hl2 and the gameplay should be adapted to all this randomness. I don't think it's riht to force the winner to play another round. on the other hand, one can be clearly better than the other guy and BARELY WIN because a bunch of stupid stuff hapened. Just gotta be careful etc. And it's not like there's money if you win.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The Draft will be 4 versus 4 (or 3 v 3, depending on participation) and will be run entirely from Steam.<br>
There are 8 different Draft Team Group pages created for the teams.<br>
Team Captains will be picked (or coerced) during the week and will see after their teams that night.<br>
<br>
Here is how it will work:<br>
-All Draft members can check for any schedule changes and general information here.<br>
Draft members will get event updates.<br>
<br>
-On Draft night, event messages will go out to join this group chat. <br>
<br>
-Join Chat on this page. This is the Draft Lobby. You can only be picked if you are in the Draft Chat Lobby. <br>
-All Team assigns and Order of Draft will be decided randomly by The Hat.<br>
-Team Captains will pick and while they are picking, each Team Captain (1 - 8 ) will assigned their own Draft Team group page. <br>
-As the picks go down, players will be invited to their group. <br>
-You will get an invite. At that point, if you have been drafted, go to your Team Group and leave the Draft Lobby. During the Draft, the players will see their Captain there and after, get server info and gameplans.<br>
<br>
-Everything will done in Steam. The Teams will be the only folks invited to their group (excepting permanent Draft admin).<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>

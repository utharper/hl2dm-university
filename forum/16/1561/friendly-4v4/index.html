like modal said a few days ago "everyones always out to get you when your at the top", which is somewhat true but then again i wanna see who would end up on "top" if we play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That's an ignorent question. He's played several season's in CAL, and quite a few side tourneys and leagues. UG even signed up for Warzone, when you guys were busy dissing it.<br>

Actually, this is a statement incorrectly punctuated.<br>
It should read: "You do not understand the point of a league."<br>
As a question: "Do you not understand the point of a league?"<br>

This doesn't really seem right at all. Not to engage in $W love or anything, but as an observer, it seems $W have spent much effort and time promoting CAL, admin'ing, even promoting with films and such. They seem to have been on hand and fielded a team for every CAL commitment that has come along. Last night, they ACTUALLY played another team to win the 4 v 4 final. So, what's the real beef?<br>
UG dropped out. They DIDN"T play (guess i have made more enemies).<br>

If someone wanted a friendly- i mean friendly- match, why make an ungracious fuss here about it?<br>

this makes no sense<br>
<br>
so basically, telling people to join cal if they want to play is unfair because "maybe they don't want to compete competitively?" the whole point of playing scrims is to play competitively, if you want to play non-competitively go join a decent pub like khaos' and play through the mapcycle.<br>

I think they all kind of have something called Real Life catching up to them.  In case you havent noticed none of them play all that much anymore.  Kind of makes you wonder how long $W will be around as it is.  The day they or any team leaves DM for good will be a sad day for the game and this community. <br>
<br>
As Impala stated, they had players in all 3 divisions of the DM league they played their matches and got as aggravated as anyone else when they had to FW someone.  UG "lost" one of their best players because he did something stupid and the whole team payed the price for it, but instead of finishing the season anyway, they dropped out.  I dont see why anyone should accomodate a "friendly" match just because you want to prove something.  Truely makes me sad to see this conversation occurring at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I find that kind of funny luke, not to start anything, but all of you so called "top" players always have stupid excuses for not playing some people who might actually stand a chance and by repeatedly rejecting their matches wouldn't be helping very much. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
(saying that because I've heard a few stupid ones.) <br>
I also think that you shouldn't rely on every 1v1/clan match to be your matches, it just doesn't seem right... it seems that you're basically, in some way, that shouldn't really work on people, forcing them to join some league even though maybe they don't want to compete competitively, and I think you should understand that. :\<br>
teto</div></blockquote>

this makes no sense<br>
<br>
so basically, telling people to join cal if they want to play is unfair because "maybe they don't want to compete competitively?" the whole point of playing scrims is to play competitively, if you want to play non-competitively go join a decent pub like khaos' and play through the mapcycle.<br>
<br>
and to the first part of your post: simply lol<br>

<br>
so you made this in order to create drama because you knew you would've gotten a refusal? rgr!</div></blockquote>nah i thought it would have given me a better chance then a pm. <br>

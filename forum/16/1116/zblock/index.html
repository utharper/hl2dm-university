zBlock was first developed as an addition to the "CSP" server plugin, at this time VALVe had accidentally let a convariable slip that would allow players to "wallhack".<br>
"CSP" (CAL Server Plugin) was a server plugin that enforced certain convariables that could either be exploited or created an unbalanced/unfair playing field.<br>
Another feature of zBlock was to make CSP more difficult to bypass, however not too long after the original release, we determined that we could much more efficiently incoorporate CSP's functionality into zBlock- than to protect CSP's features from the outside. After which zBlock became the stand alone plugin we know today.<br>
<br>
zBlock is now one of the most used CS Source server plugins all around the world, enforced in leagues like EnemyDown, ESL, Clanbase, OGL, CAL and CEVO.<br>
<br>
It is avaiable for hl2dm. And works well. Only thing is that the cal.cfgs cant have the pause_plugins_all since zblock is a plugin.  And provides valuable info, server and client side<br>
<br>
It also provides or will hopefully provide for hl2dm client authorization. Meaning that when you enter a server running zBlock it will tell you what cal division the person is enrolled in and what team they play for.<br>
<br>
zBlock can be disabled.<br>
<br>
They are also working on it so that when you auth it will say if you are logged into ACS.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If sv_pure to provided full coverage when it comes to consistency then why would every League require that it be used for source games. From CEVO-p to CAL-I, zBlock must be used in conjunction with ACS and sv_pure 2. I have already had people not be able to get in my server because of the restrictions it has in place. Hl2:Dm needs this and it is fully functional with hl2dm. I have even created the cfg to making it as user friendly as possible.<br>

After you install the cfgs all you need to do is type in console rcon calteam or rcon cal1v1 and the cfg will load.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes it will, but HL2:Dm has to be loaded on the auth host for that to happen. As of now its just CS:S. So when i join my server it says the cal-o team i am on for css.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its not gonna have any adverse effects. my server is still keeping it up, i just wont use it for cal. I dont understand what the problem would be of all the other source games require it for EVERY league, I dont know why we weren t using this from the start.<br>

	<div class="content">This is a response i received from one of the zblock staff...<br>
<br>
so...<br>
you request that zblock sets mp_weaponstay to 0 after a lo3 ?<br>
This would be no problem... It does already a similar for Counterstrike Source. (mp_startmoney set to a different value after an lo3)<br>
<br>
<br>
Problems with the cal cfg:<br>
sv_pure_kick_clients 0, but zblock forces 1<br>
sv_client_cmdrate_difference 40, but zblock forces 30<br>
sv_client_interpolate -1, but zblock forces 1<br>
sv_client_max_interp_ratio 2, but zblock forces 1<br>
sv_client_predict -1, but zblock forces 1<br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with zblock, expect this missing feature.<br>
CAL should rather consider to adjust their config files if they want to use zblock for hl2dm aswell.<br>
<br>
But there is one important change in zBlocks Netsettings.<br>
It forces the client to use interpolate 1, with your current config file, you are able to choose between 0 and 1, this won't be changed!<br>
<br>
In General:<br>
Nothing will be changed, but adding neccessary features is no problem in general Smile<br>
<br>
Also Cal should change their sv_minupdaterate from 20 to 30 Wink<br>
20 leads to a laggy gameplay.<br>
<br>
there are no other commands it changes.<br>
it just changes netsettings, the physics and everything else stay the same way<br>
<br>
cvars being forced serversided:<br>
sv_pure_kick_clients 1<br>
sv_allow_wait_command 0<br>
av_allow_collor_correction 0<br>
sv_client_max_interp_ratio 1<br>
sv_client_min_interp_ratio 1<br>
sv_client_interpolate 1<br>
sv_client_cmdrate_difference 30<br>
sv_client_predict 1<br>
sv_consistency 1<br>
sv_pure 0 not possible. sv_pure defaults to 2<br>
<br>
client-sided:<br>
only allows mat_dxlevel 80/81/90/95<br>
only certain values allowed for bumpmap/specular</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I thought the server logs was a given, but about the SourceTV - we're not going to use sourceTV or even allow spectators during matches. There is a spectate bug that allows invisible spectators. The easiest and safest way to prevent this is to disable spectate altogether.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If all goes well I would like to participate in this league.<br>
<br>
I don't mind the whole Holy as dictator thing seeing as if you screw up the league will die and it'll be no big loss to anybody anyway.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2.7	Any registered league player may start a vote on the EverythingFPS forums to force an administrator vote, veto an administrator action, or remove an administrator. In order for a vote to pass, two-thirds of all registered league players must vote in the affirmative within one week.</div></blockquote>

No way 2/3 of people will show up to your forums to vote, let alone vote the same way. Lots of people register and then lose interest or simply don't care what happens.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2.6.  All accusations of cheating must be investigated. Such investigations must remain private until a decision has been reached.<br>
3.7	If a player suspects another player of cheating or violating another league rule, that player should contact an administrator privately. A player who publicly accuses another player of cheating may receive a penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct.</div></blockquote>

Ok, as someone who has played dm for a while but never been in "that circle of players that know what everybody is up to and consider it highly privileged and secret information", I'm gonna say that this is a detrimental rule. First of all ,you're not protecting anybody. Its not like a person is going to get blacklisted because somebody got butthurt and yelled hacks. Give people the accusation and the demos, and let them decide for themselves.  Even if I disagree with the leagues decision, I'll still respect it. Second of all, from what I've seen, a community of people is way better at pinning proof on a guy then a league of admins. How many hackers did CAL convict while they were secretly reviewing demos? I can't think of any. Not to mention half the community would call bullshit admins and not believe it anyway. <br>

	<div class="content">First some responses to cheese... Holy is not a dictator, he is an equal vote on the board and equal in many regards *EXCEPT* for perm tenure on the admin board and the ability to appoint admins he sees fit. Considering Holy is probably the least biased guy I've met in a long time I dont foresee this being a problem along with the community admin removal option.<br>
<br>
Second response, what do suggest in regards to the 2/3 admin removal vote cheese? I mean if we lower it too much we will be risking ourselves to rotating admins far too often, and structural chaos would ensue. We are open to options and want to hear what you would suggest in that regards.<br>
<br>
Third response, the hacking accusations once we see fit will be completely disclosed when the matter has resolved itself. If the community feels that we made a misjudgement all the material we judged off will be provided and the community may override our decision.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I got nothing against Holy, I just mean because it was his idea, his website, he's drafting the rules, and he's the head admin. Either directly or indirectly he can do whatever he pleases. As long as he stays smart and doesn't fuck up, good things will come. <br>
<br>
As for the admin removal thing I say just let Holy do whatever he wants. If he feels like he needs more help then ok. If he doesn't like one of your decisions, let him change it. Its just common sense with things like making all of the admins from the same clan or being open minded to what your admins are doing. Common sense. Like with blur. He was hacking, so you banned him. Good example of how easy things are when you don't over complicate. <br>

<br>
<br>
You're missing the bigger picture. If you involve the entire community in the accusation process the particular person is permanently stained whether he did hack or not. It's not that I dont think the community cant handle it, its the risk you take like past occurances like Seagull's witch hunt where he got half of the community to believe Invx and Nutri Grain were hackers that its not wise to release a possible false accusation against someone who may be innocent. <br>
<br>
The next four months all I heard was, you play with a hacker? (referring to InvX, or Nutri). Innocent until proven guilty, and then if we fucked up we lay our decision process on the line for everyone to see and you get to reverse if we messed up.<br>
<br>
Also your other comments are disturbing, no form of governance should be a dictatorship, ever, whether we're governing  10 nerds or governing the most powerful country on earth, dictatorship is a not an option and I will never support. Mechanisms are in place so that Holy is not a dictator. The other admins and the community can override him at will.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Disagreed. I will not be participating in revealing any and every cheating accusation. If we allow that we'll start having *FOR EXAMPLE* someone in TPA accusing Constipator of hacking just cause' and then the community is gonna be like oooooooooh ahhhhhhhhh Constipator might be hackingz?!?!

	<div class="content">@ Cheese - It's just 2/3 of the players registered to actually play in that current season. Theoretically, people signing up to play for that season will hear about the vote and go vote if its something they care about. As for the rules regarding cheating accusations, I think that stopping witch hunts will vastly improve the overall spirit and mood of league play. Don't you? I'm really glad you've decided to play, by the way.<br>

The above also wont work if the servers are controlled by players, for obvious reasons. League-controlled match servers would go a long way toward blocking most forms of cheating, assuming those with sufficient coding ability mod/plug them accordingly.<br>
<br>
As for cal, we didnt have access to its backend code, and in any case much of it was buggy or didnt function at all. The scheduler in particular was so broken that from early season one onward i just scheduled everyone manually based on rank/rpi.

If the exploit exists, remove all room for it's use and eliminate sourcetv until it can be resolved.  Doesn't matter who the team is, it will never be an issue if it's not a possibility.  The only time anyone bothers watching matches is during finals anyway.  <br>
The same holds true for the league servers.  With all the exploits and vulnerabilities that are available now, it's better to only use servers in which officials can monitor every aspect of the game.<br>
You want a legitimate league, you need to be firm with the standards and don't skimp.  You have an opportunity to start a league from the ground up and eliminate the mistakes of those leagues before it - don't fuck it up by compromising.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If you build a flexible web site you can add games at will but lets be reasonable here. Bugs are going to be popping up for months, trying to attack games with established leagues is kinda over zealous. I know from experience and watching others fail the most common way an organization screws up is trying to grow too fast. How about the first season you be realistic and start with 1 game HL2DM. Then maybe you add a second game by the time season two rolls around. And as I stated before this 2 week start up time is ridiculous run at least one more season at CU while you build the website and get a beta out that people can look at and then people will not be rushing you.  At first focus on smaller games which do not have leagues supporting them. Giving you time and flexibility because smaller games have no choice they will not be as picky about what your site is capable of.  As you improve your website maybe eventually you will have something worth attacking bigger games with. But why would people in CSS join some brand new league unless lots of money is involved or they hack or are mediocre and just want some less competitive place to play at. Is the back end whipped together in the claimed 2 weeks going to be as good as leagues like CEVO and GGL which have had years to develop? <br>
<br>
As for source TV like I said the number 1 way people hack is they just strait up install a multi hack loaded with everything they need, undetectable by VAC, any plugin, or any anticheat why would someone bother with some lame spec hack and even if they did they would be much easier to catch. I agree all hacks should be stopped that is unless it makes the game much worse for the people playing it legitimately. Lots of people have always asked me to spec my matches, I am pretty sure someone would spec in at least 50% of matches for top 4 teams. I view it just like DRM in music or movies its a good thing until it starts making less people buy your music. I don't think it is good to punish every good player in the community by not allowing them to spectate matches just for the remote chance 1 idiot will use a spec hack which probably wouldn't even allow him to win a match he would have lost.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have largely been quiet in all of this because I am spending every waking moment that I am not at my job writing code for the site.  But I think it is probably time to reset a few expectations.<br>
<br>
When Holy approached me about starting a site that would host maps/skins/etc I had already been toying with the notion of writing a site that would allow for league management so I suggested that as well as a few other things (forums, news/articles).  This was really the birth of the idea for eFPS.  At the time Valiums was still preparing for the second season of CU which I viewed as perfect.  My original estimate for the league portion (the most difficult part to develop) was 3-4 months which meant that I could have it done just about when the second season of CU was wrapping up.  Then Valiums had to give up on CU.<br>

I agree 100% with this.  You have to learn to walk before you can run.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Fearsome* wrote:</cite>And as I stated before this 2 week start up time is ridiculous run at least one more season at CU while you build the website and get a beta out that people can look at and then people will not be rushing you.</div></blockquote>

I know this isn't what Holy wants to hear but I think that Fearsome is correct here as well.  I am committed to delivering eFPS but reading all these messages about adding this game or that game and taking on CEVO and what not is putting the cart before the horse.  I had originally hoped to have a first iteration out in 2-4 weeks.  I suspect that I wasn't clear to Holy that the first iteration wouldn't be a production ready site hence Holy's original announcement.  My mistake, I am used to dealing with developers who know iterative development.  The first iteration is more like a glimpse into the future and a chance for stake holders (Holy and myself) and subject matter experts (Fearsome, Ko-Tao, etc.) to take a look and provide feedback on the general direction the site is taking.  So yes... a second season of CU is advisable if for no other reason than to give me time to actually do this right instead of trying to rush it and end up with something that either doesn't work or that no one wants to use.<br>
<br>
Again, I am committed to delivering eFPS, but I do believe that everyone needs to reset their expectations a bit on where we are going and how quickly we will get there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Wall hacks, been around since this game started, thousands of people have used them and never been caught by vac, any plugin, or any anticheat hundreds of people and many companies have tried everything they can think of to stop them and guess what, it has not worked. If you care so much you make people go to a LAN. <br>
<br>
DOS attacks have been around since before this game, 100 billion market cap companies cannot stop them, google can't stop them, 10 years of this and millions of dollars from the top companies and minds in the world cannot solve DOS attacks and valliums is going to solve it? <br>
<br>
It is alot easier just to take a demo and use a jury to bust people then it is to make a system stop it. This even tonight only showed that you will never stop it a couple days and they already beat your anticheat. So don't bother trying to pretend you will. Maybe you should also look at targeting the person doing it. Hacking or DOS attacks break the TOS of almost every ISP prove it then contact his ISP to get his internet shut off. On top of that in most countries they lead to indirect criminal charges. <br>
<br>
Let whomever wants to run a league at CU or where ever if eFPS gets up and running people can decide if they want to move to it. In the mean time nothing has changed it will not be the first or last time I have been hacked in a video game especially not this one, I have played anyway and most other have as well.

Listen, guys. Here's my two cents. I'm speaking not as an administrator but rather as a normal player. <br>
<br>
If you hack in this game, you're not cheating us. You're cheating yourself. You're wasting your time - you're not getting any better, you're not getting full enjoyment out of the game, you're going to be on edge every time you submit a demo or see someone spectating. Even if you find something our servers can't stop, you're going to be cheating yourself out of the entire point of the game - to get better, to compete against legitimately good players, to enjoy camaraderie, and to feel accomplished when you defeat a worthy opponent. <br>
<br>
If you think you can hack in this game without getting caught, you're wrong. Look at Zeik, banned from everything in this game worth being a part of. Look at Blur, de-friending everyone, getting kicked out his clan, and not being able to compete with the good players he got better with. This is a videogame, but its something you invest your time in, and so it matters. Don't choose to not hack because you're scared of getting caught. Choose to not hack because you value what you're invested in.<br>

Maybe you're not understanding (you are a semi-retarded, so I'll give you some slack) this isnt about allegations and is about a script that can compromise servers if the person uses it correctly. How many times do I need to say this shit? Hey if you guys really want to play in a league without LSS script protection, be my guest, I'll resign, it'll be an exploiters paradise this season and I sure as shit will not play in a league where someone can compromise my server, and even change my own config if he knows how to script it correctly..<br>
<br>
EDIT; Oh and Zeik's been PM'ing people the script/hack combination personally since he's been banned from here, I know of 6 aliased different people who have been trying out the hack + script in public servers. I would seriously take a step back and ask yourself whether you would want to start now without the protection since Zeik's been mass spamming people with the link for the script + hack and the forums where people code the script.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't have to turn it upside down, I'm already smiling remembering how badly I raped you the last time I played you. Terrible player, terrible logic. Let's say we start RIGHT now, I have the knowledge and power to do all of the following.<br>
<br>
1. LSS scripting takes advantage of a major source engine hole in security. I can hide every single hack or script I want to.<br>
2. I can change your server config at will and can bypass sv_cheats 1. In demo reviews I would have it on a toggle function to look unsuspicious, toggle sv_cheats 1 on and off at will.<br>
3. I can make any script I want to undetectable by Zblock/KAK/Keepers<br>
4. Give me another week understanding LSS scripting and I will be able to manually change your config, I can change your rates to make it look like your rate cycling and get you banned from the league.<br>
5. I'm not the only one who knows how to take advantage of the source engine loophole and LSS scripting, for one Voz does, and I'm not surprised he wants to start the league early <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">. <br>
<br>
I am ready to resign though and let an admin replace me that is of the position to start it now. Perhaps I'll stay in the league and hack it up just for fun to prove how stupid it is to start early, but I have never tried a hack in my life, I only have the knowledge how to now and will never hack even though I do now, I dont need to.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Once again Holy just makes sense while I continue to look for knifefights, I think on purpose. The whole arguement is pretty vain as the website won't even be operational for awhile yet, by the time its finished we will have a working LUA/LSS script blocker up anyway. I'm no dictator and people may resume CU league, all you have to do is talk to Nix on CU about a managerial appointment and continue the league, simple as that. CU has made itself clear on its cheating and anticheat policies, policies that are woeful and lacking, and thus another reason I chose not to continue it. I see alot of people here crying about resuming CU, well GODDAMNIT do it then good sir! Become an administrator and do it then, dont cry to me about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">XPL is OK at some things, but not at others. For one, the website design is atrocious. It looks like something out of the 90's. More importantly, however, XPL doesn't support TF2 or hl2dm. And they won't. Why would they? It doesn't make sense for a league that's looking for sponsors and trying to give out cash to winning teams. IMO, when a league starts being driven by the desire to gain more sponsorship and award bigger amounts of money, that's when the love of the game takes a backseat to revenue charts. <br>
<br>
On a fundamental level, though, what XPL is aiming for is something much different than what we envision eFPS becoming. XPL wants to just be a league. We envision eFPS as an all-in-one gaming community, where users can go to grab maps and skins, read the latest news on their games, talk to other people in forums, and play competitively in leagues. That's a one-site solution to what is really a four site process now (steam for news, fpsbanana for maps and skins, hl2dm-u for forums, and CU for leagues).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It requires access to the Windows API, be it directly or indirectly.  That being said, I don't know that LUA scripts being executed by the source engine have the ability to overwrite files.  Making the config files read-only may not help.  The scripts may simply be affecting the variables in memory and never actually cause your config files to be overwritten.<br>
<br>
I was simply offering up advice or an idea to look into for whoever is developing the plug-in to combat LUA scripts.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, my feeling is that the LUA scripts are affecting memory, and the read-only attribute on your configuration files won't help.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yes, but the thing about a free league (not saying it's bad or anything like that, I like playing in them still) is that for games like hl2dm where the community is very small, you won't get any new players, you'll just have the same couple of teams playing every season. I understand that hl2dm is an old game etc.etc. but I think we need a new or new-ish league that is trying to get sponsors etc. for hl2dm, especially if we have the extra chance of already knowing some people that are going to run the league because yes it's nice to have a league,  but I'm pretty sure people are getting or eventually will get bored of playing the same 5 teams over and over again a couple of seasons in.

l4d2 didn't get in xpl.  for a game this size a community run is going to be a better bet.  The players in hl2dm could donate a couple bucks for prizes but it is not going to be enough for new teams to join.  While it takes time new teams do happen.  Look at the CAL's last season til CU, almost completel different teams.  The game has always had good numbers just a high turn around rate.  Almost no one is still around from the STA days and I know only 3 people are still around that even know what AAT means.<br>
<br>
Community based is going to mean faster desisions and less forfeits.  It is either play the same 5 teams or play 3 of the 5 teams with 2 forfeits.  Look at CU once you get some seasons in the new teams that are srs will come.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We've already had a litmus test of an organization, a huge one at that let us exist under their larger organization, that was CAL. We've seen the results of the integration, a ton of new clans with CSS hotheads who thought they could learn the game in a week and assumed they had better skills automatically. They got annihiliated because of the skill gap and never came back, we ended up just wasting our time against these new clans and players completely. Not only that but we saw how upper admins interfered with the running of the HL2DM division who knew nothing about the game. I.E. the nutri grain demo review by a guy who was rumored to not even had the game downloaded at the time.<br>
<br>
IMO Holy is planning an adequate organization as it is already that is similar to your concept, let it cook awhile longer. For COD for example we'd probably have diferent admins like Da11aS for example.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
It seems like Tim (if this is really him and not panic or someone/thing trolling) is interested in a competitive resurgence of hl2dm; one can infer he wants to defend is utterly useless and barely admirable "title." <br>
Why the fuck else would he be directing his self-proclaimed "invaluable attention" to this thread?  <br>
<br>
Sure. Yah. Mindless trolling; with billy? No. <br>
His is not the over-zealous type like myself. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>
<br>
I see some admins are deleting his posts; my advice is to leave them, so long as they are not off the fucking charts when it comes to how offensive they are. Looking back on when I used spam-bots and shit on these forums, it was actually a blessing that my mindless bullshit was deleted as it erased any record of me being a total jackass. No more evidence now. Just hearsay. <br>
I for one don't give a small dick about hl2dm's league scene. The game is still a joke from a competitive standpoint, as Micahwave said all those years ago. Shitty physics + unbalanced weapons = bullshit game. Only thing worth playing it for is the movement system which is still a little too slow for a REAL fps and it happened by accident. <br>
<br>
Yah. Accident. Prolly why that's the aspect of the game that turned out 'O.K.' <br>
<br>
That's why I have not posted in this thread or one's like it 'casue I really don't care. <br>
But Timmy - if that is really you - why the fuck do YOU care? <br>
Just randomly post in the sc2-related threads, much like I have with Metroid-related shit on this site. <br>
That way you don't look so desperate/queer/gay/etc. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, and speaking from considerable experience, I can honestly say you're a fucking faggot.  <br>
Not for trolling, but for caring about hl2dm and "ur title." lawl.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

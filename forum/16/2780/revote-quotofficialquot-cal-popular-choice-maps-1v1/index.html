lockdown_r4 and joyride_r1 arent finished either, but they made the nominations list nevertheless and are up for voting.<br>
<br>
Im pretty sure when future revisions of existing maps are nominated or suggested for inclusion in the league, its on the assumption that theyll be completed in time for the main season- which isnt a problem for either of the nominated maps im revising, and i should hope wont be a problem for ldr4 either.<br>
<br>
Whether or not ldr4 is superior or inferior to a bugfixed original ld isnt the discussion here; thats what the votings for, though its obviously hard to make a choice if one of the maps isnt on the list.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Rackir, dm_Joyride was not nominated as a 1v1 map.  If you wanted it you should have nominated it.<br>
<br>
The map nominations and polls were done because people constantly bitched about the maps so we decided to let people nominate potential maps then vote on what they wanted from that list so that people could have input into their league.<br>
<br>
Some of us are so sick and tired of the damned if you do damned if you don't situation of being a CAL admin.   We are not going to redo the damn poll again.  I am not going to spend another week fucking around with this.  You had plently of opportunity to get your input in.  You will probably get another chance next season if this hasn't turned out to be more of a hassle than its worth.  Next time we can just stick with the same damn maps end of story.<br>

start over from scratch, with a detailed paragraph on what makes a map acceptable.  <br>
<br>
fearsome wrote this:<br>
there was no point of spelling out what makes a good map, obviously just making a good high quality map will not make it popular.<br>
<br>
so the guy who nominates maps based on what he likes has a good chance they will not make the poll because he does not know the guidelines for map nomination.  <br>
<br>
Now. Where The Hell Is DM_JOYRIDE<br>
<br>
this whole map topic stuff makes me not like CAL.  It was handle like a dirty diaper by lazy parents.  <br>
<br>
kill the poll (seriously)and kill the admins(not seriously).  Vote for Hillary and Tipper in 2012.</div></blockquote>

My comment had nothing to do with the events of last season, as unfortunate and frustrating as it was for many of us. <br>
 <br>
The polls were an attempt to give players (YOU GUYS) a chance to have some input into CAL, which is what we have heard that was wanted.  It just seems like no matter what we try, someone complains.  It makes me wonder if we should even try cause people are gona complain no matter what we do and I for one could use my time more constructively if thats the case.   For the record,  I didnt even vote in the polls myself.<br>

Heh ya, wasnt lulz for me though as i was down a frag or two at the time and needed to catch up... was almost impossible to see him stuck inside one of those rock models as he was. As said though, avalon has a load of bugs and some sick hiding spots, and the mapper refuses to fix it or let us do so, so its better off gone.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

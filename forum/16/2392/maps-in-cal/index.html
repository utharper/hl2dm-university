	<div class="content">Please post and list maps you think would be good or you would like to see for CAL.  You can list ones that are already in CAL if you like those.  Please categorize them according to division: ie<br>
<br>
1v1 Lostarena, biohazard, Aim arena<br>
2v2 ......<br>
4v4 ......<br>
<br>
or<br>
2v/4v if you think a map can be multidivision<br>
<br>
Just looking for feedback here, no promises that a nominated map will become a CAL map.<br>

	<div class="content">here's my input for what it's worth:<br>
<br>
keep all the current CAL maps and maybe add two or three also.<br>
<br>
I had suggested in IRC a while back that dm_7hour and dm_island17 be added to 2v2 and 4v4, but those maps were apparently used in previous CAL/STA seasons and had issues (out-of-map glitches, etc.).<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/16997" class="postlink">dm_apcbunkers</a> would be a good addition to 2v2 and 4v4 in my opinion - its author does say that team matches were what the map was designed for.  I've pubbed on it pretty extensively and it flows very well and is bug-free as far as I can tell.  theres a definite element of strategy to it (RPG on top, orbs underneath).<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.fpsbanana.com/maps/17085" class="postlink">dm_please</a> might be good also although alot of people may find it to be too king-of-the-hill-y there's a definite element of strategy and weapon/location control to it (the top and the weapons cache in the graveyard)<br>
<br>
those maps in my opinion are both worth trying out for a season at least.<br>
<br>
just my two cents.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you want a killbox league, get behind it and get an admin to run it.  The admins do reserve the right to reject any suggestions here based on play type and whether the map would actually make a decent competative map.  dm_please is a king of the hill map as stated and I doubt it would be considered as well.  Any suggestions will be reviewed.  <br>

No matter how much u know about good maps its basically luck if the majority like your map. Like warlock it has a version for tdm but just cuz its made for that doesnt mean everyone is gonna like it. And also what do u think this thread is for? to find new maps it doesnt mean they have to be just released to be new but do u really think icepick is played nearly as much as any cal map..no so then i would consider it new</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here is my opinion. Yes, it is completely biased, the only criteria I used was what I have actually played in these formats, and enjoyed doing so. <br>
<br>
I am admittedly short on the 4v4 maps, but I am also an advocate of bringing the 4v4 down to 3v3 so that it is easier to schedule, less laggy in game, and can accommodate some more of the 2v2 maps.<br>
<br>
Notes indicate what I feel needs to happen for the map to be up to competitive standards.<br>

Another issue which is a big one is who gets what for tie breaker? Server? Model (who wants combine?) 2 maps was picked because it was the most fair way to determine a winner. When you get to 3 it becomes more an issue of who ends up screwed with combine for close matches. This was tried 2 seasons ago. I do not know if the proponents ever changed their minds though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm not sure that faster scoring is <em class="text-italics">that </em>much of an issue since both teams have the chance to score fast. What matters would be a map where you can rack up a huge <em class="text-italics">difference</em> in frags - usually a high control index type map like overwatch. <br>

<br>
Agreed, a new map just isn't there.... you have to pick over what's been done and hope it's going to stick. Maps like Caverns are an oddity in their awesomeness. That being said, here's my input<br>
<br>
2v2 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_7th_hour </strong>(or however it's spelled... remove 1 rpg... don't care you pick which one... maybe the one on the grassy knowl...knole... nole? can stay)<br>
1v1, 2v2 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_lostarena </strong>(RPG FREE THANKS!!!... people swear against it but I like the idea, working lifts?... they work ok for me <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> )<br>
2v2, 4v4 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_caverns_r1</strong><br>
2v2, 4v4 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_powerhouse </strong>(I hear the SLAMS were the issue in the past)<br>
2v2 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_joyride </strong>(can this be less laggy...can you say fps drop... valar help!!)<br>
1v1 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_armaggedon </strong>(spelling again sigh...a 911 map I believe... with the crazy speed ramps. different fun stuff)<br>
1v1 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_fuedal </strong><br>
2v2 - <strong class="text-strong">dm_octagon</strong> (barred because it originated from another game? was that the verdict?)<br>

They work if you are running onto them, but they dont activate if you jump down onto one, and then it activates if you run off. This behaviour is counter-intuitive. Example of what I have seen happen and has happened to me on occasion: player ends up standing on a lift they were trying to use to jump up, because they dropped onto it from above and it did not activate. Then upon realizing and running off it thinking its not going to activate, they double back to finally do their jump only to find its now activated after they left.<br>

Agreed. For that matter, Biohazard is a HLDM remake, and Drift was originally made for AG2, yet they both play very well in HL2DM. Im sure most would say the same for Lostvillage, also a HLDM remake.<br>
<br>
Originality is great- Tigcrik, Zeta, Lostarena etc are all fine HL2DM specific maps- but when the desire for originality starts locking strong maps out of the league (especially considering the glaring lack of solid new HL2DM maps) we have a problem.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

On death count on both maps to determine the winner well it true you can rack up allot of kills on certian maps compared to others but both teams have equal chance of racking up those kills on both maps but the overall frag count is determined on how well one plays those maps such as tactics, teamplay and control on focus points. Having a third round to determine the winner is not a good method because u allways end up with the argument who will be combine which is a disavantage.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

what about when you drop down from inside the room, you make the elevator go up and block someone from following you.  Always found that to be a helpful feature.  Besides this only happens when you drop down which i never understood why you wanna go back where you came that split second.  If it's like Bio hazard you will not be able to drop down in the room.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well on the outside lifts its not that you want to go back where you came from, its being able to jump into the lift and use it as a spring board. <br>
<br>
You can use it to block your opponent from above, but if the lifts go up after you run off it, it also cuts off that route as a path of escape should you need to double back. If you forget it works that way, you may end up stuck under the lift as it resets.<br>
<br>
In a design sense its just that lifts represent a visual cue and you expect consistent behavior from them. Kind of like at a Quiznos sandwich place by my old work. They have doors that look like they swing inwards, but they only swing outwards, inconsistent with every other store in the area. We would sit there eating lunch and watch person after person slam into the door trying to get in, or tugging on it for a few seconds trying to get out before finally figuring out it goes the other way. Even when we <em class="text-italics">knew</em> which way it went, every so often we would mess up using them because it was so counter intuitive. Point is, you shouldn't need to be conscious of it, nor learn special tricks for it to work properly.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

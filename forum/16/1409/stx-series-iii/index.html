I have hosted 2 successful Severian Half Life tournies and I am now planning to host STX SERIES III. The catch is, I am new to HL2 and I dont have links to very many HL2 clans. If you have links to other HL2 clans, please post them here. If you are in a clan that would be interested in participating in this tourney, please visit <a href="http://www.timetokill.org" class="postlink">http://www.timetokill.org</a> and post your clan's name here<br>

STX SERIES III will be a HL2/Shellshock Mod 4v4 Tourney.  I have a team trying to locate other HL2 clans so that we can invite as many teams as possible. I figure it will take a month of advertising the event to get maximum participation. 1 sponsor, usually provides HLTV and a free server to the winning clan. I have to talk with the other sponsor to see what they will offer. Also, I am looking for other sponsors for t-shirts, peripherals, and stuff like that.  After that it is on to Phase 2.<br>
We will hold a map vote to see which maps will be played each week. I kinda push the point that we want the biggest maps with alot of open room for long range sniping and close 4v4 battles where team tactics must be considered.<br>
Here are the rules from STX SERIES II.  I will be amending these to fit HL2/Shellshock <br>
STX SERIES GENERAL INFO: STX stands for Shotgun Trumps Xbow. This tourney was started in 2006 with the desire to try something alittle different. We wanted to take a break from the standard 4v4 "run and gun" tournement being played on the same original 8 valve maps over and over. In this tourney, you will still see the 4v4 setup, but you will see those 4 players in each team armed to the teeth. You will see the battles being played out on the biggest maps available in the game. We hoped that this would make teams re-think their stratagies..There will be no holding the box room with shotguns during STX Series!!! For people that have played Sevs &amp; AG, you will like the fact that the weapons reload fast as hell. The pace will be furious.  All things considered, our 2 previous tourney were a huge success and we hope that this one will be even bigger and better than the last one.<br>
<br>
RULES<br>
1. Scoring - 1 point for the winning team and zero for the losing team.<br>
2. Fraglimit 0 - Timelimit 20 minutes<br>
3. Spawn camping/ spawn mining - Any team who gets 2 kills by placing mines or satchels at spawn points will cause his/her team to lose by default. Spawn camping will be defined as any player or TEAM who engages/kills 2 or more opponents who have just spawned, without engaging any other targets. Situation will dictate and at that point, it will be left up to STX Admins to decide if a player/players are, in fact, spawn camping. On big maps, this should be pretty difficult, but if you get 3 "spawn kills" in a row without engaging other targets, your demo will be reviewed.<br>
4. All matches will take place in the <a href="http://www.TIMETOKILL.org" class="postlink">http://www.TIMETOKILL.org</a> server unless otherwise noted/scheduled. <br>
5. Teams will be counted as present so long as they have 3 players. Teams will have 10 minutes after the designated match time to have their players present. Players will not be allowed to join once the match has started.<br>
6. Disrespecting other clans will not be tolerated prior to, during, or after the match. There should be no talking at the start of the match except by teams captains. <br>
7. Disrespecting other players/clans in the forum will not be tolerated. Players who fail to heed this warning will be banned from the forum. Injured players/clans may appeal to the STX Admins to determine if the offensive remark should result in banning the player from the tourney. STX Admin will base there their findings on the following guideline, "Does the remark disrupt the good order and discipline of the STX Series?"<br>
8. Additions may be made to rosters, but the added player/players will not be eligible to play for 1 week (to the day of addition). No player/players may be added to the roster 2 weeks before playoffs.<br>
9. Players must participate in atleast 2 regular season matches to be eligible for playoffs.<br>
10. Each team will assign an AMBASSADOR TO THE MASSACRE who must provide an active email address, steam friends ID, clan forum info for contact purposes.<br>
11. Lagging Out - You can replace a player who is lagging out, but each team is responsible for having a back up player ready to go and giving the back up player the server password. <br>
If the lag out occurs within the first 5 minutes of play, the admin may restart the match or the teams may agree to reschedule. After 5 minutes, you can replace the high pinger at your own risk, but the match will not be stopped, paused, or resheduled.<br>
<br>
<br>
Server configs:  The only thing I have have to do is speed up the xbow reload and maybe hold a vote to see if the majority of the peeps want additonal weapons. Otherwise, the best way to get a feel for it is to jump in the server, not read about it!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You dont have to be familiar with valve or sevs, or bubblemod..That is our background. Where we come from....<br>
This tourney, STX SERIES III, is a HL2 tourney. If you are in a clan, have your clan register so I can get a head count. If you are not in a clan, find 4 or 5 people to form your own team.<br>
It will be a 4v4 set up. We will keep the screenshots, demos, make predictions, have fun, and depending on how many teams join, 8-10 teams could wind up in the playoffs, from that 1 team will emerge as the STX SERIES III Champions, and the winners will get prizes, a trophy to take back to their website, and some serious bragging rights.<br>
The gameplay will be faster than the HL2DM that you are used too. Shellshock Mod does not leave you jumping around trying to save yourself while you wait on a slow ass reload. This will be guns blazing for 20 minutes per match, roughly 12-15 matches (1 per week) and when the smoke clears one team will stand victorious. <br>
Feel Free to stop by <a href="http://www.timetokill.org" class="postlink">http://www.timetokill.org</a> to talk about it more. This will be the biggest HL2 tourney of the year. <br>
This is a work in progress..but by the time we kick it off, every angle will be covered in great detail.  I have an AWESOME group of people to help make sure that happens.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

so if your bhopen along and you see someone spawn you can kill them, you just dont want us to camp by a spawn and get 2 kills that way, but we can spawnkill all we want just no camping right?

Spawn kill rules are problematic for so many reasons in competitive play. Trying to camp a spawn point for 20 minutes wont work, it will just get you killed.

	<div class="content">Agreed....  Most of you should understand that we are talking about a different mod then regular hl2dm<br>
Info on the mod: <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/6921/shellshock" class="postlink">http://www.moddb.com/mods/6921/shellshock</a><br>
<br>
We have been playing for 7+ years at least I have.  Many tourneys and most of the rules have been because someone always tests there limits.   No spawn camping is meant more for the person that camps with a xbow zoomed in at the spawn point waiting for a person to spawn(in old hl you held 5 rounds and could shoot them off really fast in sevs).  If you are up and moving around it is unavoidable to nail someone in this mod as they spawn.    <br>
<br>
Anyway hope to see some people join up this is just a very fast pace mod with alot of deaths.  The Shotgun is insane, faster shooting and usually one shot kills.  And conflict if your teammates are as good as you then I think we might be worried.. GG's to you over the weekend.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You get the first kill by skill. Then if someone spawns nearby, he just had to stay alive or  spawn somewhere else :]<br>
<br>
IMO.<br>
<br>
Depends on the map rotation, some maps (like industrial or magnumxbowyard i think) are ridiculously easy to spawncamp. In most CAL maps it's most likely not going to happen that someone spawns 8 times in a row (i was pubbing on shelchock and killed someguy 9 times in a row, he spawned in the same spot 9 times in a row. Ridiculous)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If your new to the game you should just play for a bit and get a feel for the game before you make a rule about no spawn killing but pick a mod that encourages it buy making almost all weapons 1 hit kill. That and the fact there are pretty much no clans that do any sort of league play who play shell shock which is probably why you are asking for some. Shell shock lags a servers to all get out another thing that is terrible for league play. It discourages aggressive play and rewards people for camping due to the noob friendly weapon damage.

Not sure what you mean there.  But anyway...<br>
<br>
Most people don't like the mod cause you can't control it like you can regular.  You know get all the good weapons load up on hev and health and then bounce around the map not letting the other guys get anything.   Winning by 50-5 or something like that.   This mod is just fair.  You don't have to learn every weapon, you don't have to run around and load up on everything, and when you start at spawn you at least have a chance against the player that has all the powerfull weapons.  Same with spawn camping.  Heck you have just as much chance at shooting the guy that is waiting for you at spawn as he does you.<br>
<br>
We aren't posting this league invitation to switch everyone to this professional league or anything.  We merely want about 10 or more clans to come join up for just a fun, shoot the shit kind of league.  <br>
<br>
I have seen the most leet of players have a hard time playing this mod.  Mostly because they like to play games where there is a way to gain an advantage over others.  <br>
<br>
Anyway don't knock the mod we are looking for people that would be interested in playing not people that want to put down the mod.   I have been in two shell shock servers completely full and no lag.. LOL at why a mod running the same game engine would lag a server.  TTK has hosted I think 2 tourneys in sevs(hl1) = shell shock(hl2).  SSA my old clan hosted 2 tourneys as well in sevs(hl1) = shellshock(hl2).  Yes there needed to be a rule for spawn camping.  A few clans were doing it and said it wasn't in the rules.  Trust me there is no such rule needed in regular hl2.  But in the shell shock there does, more for just in case not cause everyone does it.  I mean you will spawn kill there is no way around it but if you blaintly stand there waiting and doing nothing else but waiting for a spawn then yea that wouldn't be fair.  This only happend I think in one tourney but that was the reason for the rule.  So we kept it.<br>
<br>
Anyway HolyWar please edit it and take the rule out so we can stop talking about the stupid spawn rule.  I want some matches and good old fun.  We need to go thru some maps as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Shellshock is not aggressive? Shellshock is faster and more powerful than regular HLDM, so how can that be interpreted as not being aggressive or competitive. <br>
Ok, so your clan don't play shellshock. If you know anything about the halflife community, then you know that in the spirit of competition, a versatile clan will play in other mods. <br>
Ex. Your Clan v .::TTK::. (Shellshock)<br>
and when a HLDM tourney comes around..<br>
Your Clan v .::TTK::. (HL2 or whatever mod you want) <br>

I thought this was a good place to find gamers/ clans who like to compete for the win. We could disagree all day with the HL2DM is better than Shellshock crap. So put away your protest and come out and play. <br>

It may or may not be, HL2DM was fading pretty badly at inception and we are working hard to generate interest in vanilla HL2DM. Getting people to try something different could perhaps be a struggle, but I can't say for sure.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Honestly these are the first real discussions that we have had with seasoned HL2 players concerning the way HL2 is played.  .::TTK::. has been an HL1 severians clan for quite a long time probably longer than HL1's shelf life was intended.  .::TTK::. has taken a large step matriculating into the HL2 community and I personally am finding that .::TTK::.'s thoughts, as well as the HL1 Community's thoughts on how HL2 is viewed &amp; played, is completely different than we could've imagined.  We might as well be inviting clans in the HL2 community to join a COD tourney.  We are obviously are not comparing notes written in the same language.  But hey - learning about new gaming cultures, communities &amp; playing styles may not be for everyone.  That being said though, where would you be if people didn't venture out of the box?  My guess is you'd probably all be playing stagnant-ass HL2DM, bored to death - instead of doing something productive like finding a way to pay for a nice pair of braces for your fucked-up Limey grillz.... pwnt <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"> <br>

	<div class="content">Shell Shock is not new unless you mean it is just not as old as HL2DM. It has been around for a very long time, years. The mod just basically changes the weapon damages, what that does is changes the usefulness of the weapons and so changes what people use in practice. The real cool weapons in HL2DM become less useful and the basic weapons you can find in any game become over powerful. The end effect is it plays real boring like basically instagib in UT or something. But new players kinda like it cause they don't have to learn anything new to play it successfully. But more or less it's not even worth playing you could play any DM game and get the same effect. If you wanna play HL2DM stock is the way to go. Otherwise you might as well just play any game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Can we say Old AG Mod player or what.  LOL..    Well then we should change the advertisement too.  IF you have been playin hl2dm for a while now and still can't beat those leet players and getting tired of it.. Come play some shell shock were as long as you can aim good and really fast and strafe fast you can have alot of fun.<br>
<br>
There can you stop knocking the mod now.. JESUS....I have never thru this whole thread said that HL2DM sucked or any other game.  Heck give me some time I am going to learn HL2DM.  I know I will play it.  But right now we are comfortable playing a mod that feels the same as the old HL.  Plus I had to do some tweaks cause my fps dropped alot lol..  Shoot funny when HL1 died Sevs mod(for hl1) was the most popular mod for like the last 3 years.  There was like close to 6 tournaments.  Sevs mod started out just like shell shock nobody played it but in time people started to like it.<br>
<br>
If anything the mod will definitely improve your accuracy and quickness in aiming for sure.  Cause all the weapons are available accept for the physcannon some have it and some don't.  <br>
<br>
Players spawn with a loaded shotgun, pistol, &amp; crowbar<br>
Shotgun power is increased (way more damage)<br>
Shotgun reload time reduced (reloads quicker)<br>
Shotgun firing rate increased (shoots faster)<br>
Shotgun clip size increased (to 8 bullets, this is customizable)<br>
Crossbow bolt speed dramatically increased (almost instant, like HL1!)<br>
Crossbow bolt damage increased (almost insta-gib)<br>
Frag grenades can be launched via right-click and detonate on impact<br>
Players may spawn with any weapon combination (shotgun/melee/pistol recommended)<br>
Respawn time reduced to 0.5 seconds so players can rejoin the fray more quickly<br>
<br>
Only three weapons change.  Xbow, Shotgun, and grenade.<br>
<br>
Shotgun isn't a insta-gib shot.  You have to shoot at the head and use the secondary fire to get one shot kill.  It does shoot pretty fast.  By holdingit down but good players won't hold it down it will waste shots and miss.  <br>
<br>
Xbow is insta-gib pretty much get shot anywhere you die.  But heck other than the leet players we can all say that it is hard to nail someone with the xbow while there moving.  The speed is suppose to be faster but I can't tell hardly.  Loads little faster.<br>
<br>
Grenade is the same no weapon damage increase or anything.  You can now throw one with the sencondary that will blow up on contact.<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides the physcannon, xbow, machine gun, and shotgun what primary weapons are the most popular in hl2dm...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

IMO, it just felt dumb... you run really fast all the time, and you get killed from mid-far distance with 1 shotgun.... most used weapon was shotgun, shotgun, shotgun.<br>
I personally prefer to stick to hl2dm. As already mentioned ...if you are good at hl2dm, you will surely do fine at ss mod, but will die a lot more.<br>
It a less skilled way to play the game .... again IMO.<br>
I hope nobody gets offended by what I think... anyone can try the mod and even stick to it if they like it...in the meanwhile, I'll stick to my beloved hl2dm <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well you are posting this on a HL2DM site, and everyone here has worked together to help bring the scene back from the brink of non-existence. It was really starting to slide 2 years out from release, at least here in the US.<br>

We posted an advertisment for a tournement for a mod and then everyone started bashing it.   We posted here thinking that as many people are members to this place and since our mod is an hl2dm mod we might post it here.   Why wouldn't we defend the mod we want to play in.  I mean no where did we say hey come try this mod and like it or else.   We never came in here with any intent of converting nor trying to rustle up arguments all week.  But the people that hated it wanted to let it be known the reasons they didn't like it so we defended it.<br>
<br>
Also we never wanted to have a tournament and have it anywhere as big or as popular as CAL.  It was just for fun with rules from our old tournaments.  Possibly a way to get people that liked this mod together.<br>
<br>
And we can all agree that if you all played us in our mod we would have the upperhand and probably win.  We can all say that if anyone of us comes plays HL2DM we will probably get owned as well.  So lets not try to say anyone of us is better than anyone else.. Lets say right now..<br>

	<div class="content">I just played Shell Shock for the second time. I couldn't believe it the first time. The second time i was all like ..."hmm, this isn't at all like DM i must adapt to this new thing. Great movement...out.  Great Mag whoring...out. SUPER SHOTTY!!! And i mean crazy stupid super shotty. Hmmm. Whoever moves into position, spots someone first and gets the shot off usually wins."  Well, the bow is fast also.<br>
<br>
After gettin it used to it a little, i decided to have fun using anything BUT the shotty and camped the AR2 and Bow in Resistance! YEOOOW! Big fun there. You can always find someone cringing in a corner not moving...thunk.<br>
<br>
Most fun was Feudal, hopping and jumping the pad, blasting folks everywhere.<br>
THEN, some admin got stupid and started repeatedly spawn killing me. That is how they achieved a 58 and 12 score, with spawn kills~!<br>
lame.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, interesting for a little while. Of course most everything i love about Dm is gone and skill is sorta out the window and if you hate gettin spawn killed... well maybe not for you.<br>
<br>
Ill play it again though, for fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, i like it a bit, except for admin constantly killing me. <br>
Maps play completely different, since cover is less effective and speed is less effective. due to the spread and sheer damage of the shotty.<br>
The large maps are not as fun and one map that was a tight office floor was the best, as ninja creeping and strafing into rooms unannounced was effective.<br>
One thing i did notice, is that a kept trying to grab my beloved GGun and there isnt one.<br>
So, i wouldnt play too much as it would screw my reg game up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We are hearing from other clans out there that they are interested &amp; yes some want Gravity Gun, some want Low G, ect. The Tourney is what it is. We are just looking for people to register a team and come play with us to find out who is the best shellshock team in HL2.<br>
So registering your team is cool, we will have some fun.<br>
Wanna protest STX III or shellshock, not cool. Long live the invitation that turned into a lame debate.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Quickly touching on the ace issue, nothing up for debate, just my opinion that will help support my inquiry.<br>
<br>
When someone is banned or suspended and a large amount of the community takes interest in the matter, I believe we deserve to know. I don't give a shit about why, or how ace was banned, thats not what upsets me, what does upset me is that i should've been given the option to know. <br>
<br>
The admins of CAL thought it appropriate to withhold the true reason for him being suspended. WT had stated that he thought it was best kept private, and that if he were in ace's position he'd want it kept private. In a real life situation, you get a DUI, possession charges, pretty much anything breaking the law other than speeding and parking tickets, your name and the reason for your ticket / arrest is provided to the public like it or not.<br>
<br>
Now this brings me to the discussion i had with nino last week, before any of this ace shit was an issue or there were accusations of people i play with cheating.<br>
<br>
What do we as a community know of CAL's ACS?<br>
<br>
Why haven't we seen screenshots of what admins see?<br>
<br>
Is there anywhere we can get a description of what exactly it does to prevent and/or log cheaters?<br>
<br>
How reliable is it?<br>
<br>
What are it's faults?<br>
<br>
I myself am mainly interested in what exactly it provides to the admin, i'd like to see a log of a match, or a screenshot of something for the same reasons i think the bible and god are nonsense: it's hard for me and several other people to have faith in something we haven't seen no matter how highly some crazed person praises it.<br>
<br>
if some description of the ACS is on the cal website, i was unable to double check before i posted this since the website is down, again. Even if there is, please provide us with something better, because a 2 paragraph defintion of ACS, is not what im looking for.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I was simply debating the point sis, I am not certain I agree or disagree with such matters being kept private, I haven't really given it much thought until now. I probably would reach the conclusion that most things could be made transparent to the community.<br>
<br>
ACS on the other hand needs to remain private in order for hackers and hack makers not to be able to work/write around it. Anti-virus developers, firewalls, IDS systems all attempt to do the same thing. The police probably don't want criminals knowing the inner workings of their crime-fighting technology either.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
i just realized my demo's were unsuccessful.  i named a demo the same thing w/o ACS running and it recorded fine.<br>
<br>
along that same line, is there a master log from console?  something that i can go back to look at and see what happened?  i swear, console said it was recording.  even stopped, and recorded again for the second round.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It puts a text file in your hl2mp directory called condump###.txt  Each time it increments the file number by one.  Last time I checked I had over 128 in there.  I need to do some cleanup.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It seems Fearsome likes his own threads about himself. So I will answer his question from the v0z banned thread that was locked, no other posts from ted or voz should be allowed since they do not pertain to this topic. I feel this is important for eFPS users and the thread should remain here.<br>
<br>
begin Fearsome; "So if I go into a server and I accidentally hit a bind that tries to set r_drawotherviewmodels 2 will I be banned?" end Fearsome.<br>
<br>
That is not true, you must execute a LUA script in the first place, then this LUA script will typically enable cheats in the middle of a match, then will automatically execute the drawothermodels command to get a rudimentary wallhack working. If you type r_drawotherviewmodels 2 into console without enabling a LUA script you will not be banned in a KAC server.<br>
<br>
I tried this out many times, same applies for impulse 101 or buddha or other rudimentary cheat commands, KAC only bans it if you execute a LUA script that interferes and manually changes server settings.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">To my knowledge KAC is just an anti cheat plugin, they recently added LSS support because of numerous complaints about server crashing/exploiting. The main thing we are using KAC is to detect luas being executed. Though there is ways to get around this, you can flag certain commands that help the plugin detect popular scripts. For instance the server administrator can flag r_drawothermodels 2 which is the most popular command used for LUA wall hacks. Though r_drawothermodels 2 is a sv_cheat command LUA bypasses sv_cheats letting you run this command with it off. Only way to bypass the sv_cheats command is by using a LUA script which is executed by a client side LSS plugin. KAC detects this and either bans you, kicks you, or i guess puts you in a log? w.e the server admin wants. Going to the same server and typing r_drawothermodels 2 in console without any help from 3rd party plugins won't do anything because you are not bypassing any set server command. Hope it helps, btw the new version of LSS is out however KAC is updating their shit august 1st, the update is probably only for css because of the update but idk yet..<br>

I'm not saying he's going to be let in right away. He has consequences to pay but I think my original permanent ban is something I'm rethinking as long as he's actually doing good things for the community now.

What exactly are you suggesting? Are you actually defending v0z? He even gave up arguing after we posted the full log file on defending himself.<br>
<br>
 Another question is how exactly do you think we should log the events "securely and remotely", only about 2 people have ftp access to our eFPS server logs.

Have the logs immediately sent to a secure third party server at the time of the logging of that incedent. this is what all decent anticheat systems do. I believe Kigen has such servers which host a list of banned people.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Keep telling yourself that why did the senior admin rule in our favor?  Because you sent the wrong message to us.  Not our fault you were so in raged because you were over ruled for using random demo without proof of who it was,  the admin was familiar with cal rules across the board.  Something you lack, which is obvious here in regards to txt documents.  Cal does not accept IRC logs for anything because they can be easily tampered.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Who said you have a perm ban? All cheaters deserve a second chance IMO, plus I don't see you helping us develop an anticheat that's going to be twice as strong as our last one. zeik will pay his dues and be suspended for a good while, but its no longer a perm ban. If you're going to go to the dark side, do it Darth Vader style. Do some good things with your new knowledge that can overthrow the reign of the dark side. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Side note; any Star Wars nerd who knows anything beyond the movies VIA the comics knows Vader had joined the darkside because he knew the emperor was too powerful for anyone to destroy at the time, but as he grew older he knew he could be the only one to finally destroy him at a later time and hand over his empire to his son to make it a good empire. Which did end up happening BTW, just not the way Vader had anticipated. <br>

It does alot more then that, I'd rather not get into what it all checks for.... zeik is the one actually helping us develop a block for speedhacking as we speak. Yeah you speedhacked, you deserve to get punished for it, and no I don't see a reason to register since you won't be playing for at least a year, maybe shorter if on good behavior.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Zeik didn't discover these "new" cheats. In fact many of the LUA's were old and used by players before him. Zeik is receiving is still receiving a ban like any other player, just no longer a permanent ban. Also he helped us discover about 10 different new cheats, that's 10 less players can't use now. Zeik also doesnt know how "everything works". The eFPS anticheat client will be held private for the foreseeable future or only distributed to the most trustable people.<br>

It's good you dont care about who Mike is, he's the person responsible for how well the anticheat runs now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No actually he was degrading the plan of having a hacker helps us code an updated anticheat. It worked with bluR, he helped us discover the original KAC was inadequate to handle most of the current LUA's and helped us recode it.<br>

Because Valiums did not consult me before changing the terms of Zeik's ban, his position on Zeik's ban is just his opinion on the subject and isn't a decision that we've made. I've talked to Valiums about it.<br>
<br>
There is a KAC update coming that should fix some issues and provide a better protection against LUA/LSS in addition to some other issues. Whatever Zeik is doing, I don't think we'll end up needing his help. The KAC update should take care of any remaining issues. <br>

Do you mean bluR? I like him too. He's a straightshooting kid who didnt dance around about helping us nor receiving a solid assraping when it was time to ban him, he accepted it like a man. There's not much to talk about in regards to him since he admitted to hacking in srs scrims outside of testing purposes when confronted about it, our general policy is a year ban min for any and all hackers, hasn't changed.

I never made any statements that NICE GUY entered into it, so don't ppull that baloney.<br>
I have never known anyone to say Blur is a NICE guy.<br>
I said i like him but that doesn't really have much to do with it.<br>
The circumstances around his ban is just weird.<br>
Maybe i don't have all the facts in hand.<br>
<br>
This person was helping YOU develop a fix for hax.<br>
He has never been known to cheat before.<br>
He does not have a VAC ban.<br>
He has never cheated in a league, that we know.<br>
<br>
Something just isn't right.<br>
But i could be wrong.<br>

Seriously though people need to get punished, blur has an opportunity to bring himself to a vote next season to be unbanned if he wants. Great thing about eFPS in cases where the strict one year ban is perhaps thought as wrong by the community, they can overturn it. Me and holy won't judge who deserves to be exception to the one year rule, if you hack you get banned for one year, simple is as simple does.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Kinda screwy, this guy who wasn't suspected of being a cheater, DL'd lua Scripts to help YOU, you KNEW he had them and then he is banned as a cheater.<br>

Lesson is: Do not help anyone develop plugins to fight cheating.<br>
Seems like a setup to me.<br>

You're not understanding how it went. BluR started to go to the forums zeik posted online in these forums before ninoj started to delete his posts and started to dabble in the LUA's before he helped us. Eventually his conscious got to him and decided to start helping us out. He said he wanted to help us and had no intention of using them in matches and scrims. Guess what happ0n? blur started using the LUA walls in scrims, essentially breaking his promise to us. Scrim or not he was playing seriously, and he broke his promise not to use them out of the testing.<br>
<br>
The important thing to understand is blur was dabbling in the LUA world before he went to us, he pretty much offered to help us without much asking, there was no "setup".</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

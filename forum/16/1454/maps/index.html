<br>
i kinda feel dm_avalon_r1, dm_swamplight_final, dm_vault have run there course as far as maps in competition go.  I wouldn't mind not seeing them again. Dm_bio_harzard  odd i still have yet to paly a real 4v4 on this map.... so can't say anything.  It's great 2v2, 3v3 thats all i know.<br>
<br>
New maps i'd like to see are:  for 2v2 dm_lostarena I think it's perfect size for 2v2 and different from most other maps<br>
dm_warlock is kinda like the new LV in my mind althou not everyone plays it yet, but if it makes a league i think it will be very popular.  dm_caverns_r1 is a great map for 2v2.  dm_dirft_revised, i didn't like this map at first, but it's grown on me, althou i think everyone that plays know has grown out of this map.<br>
<br>
New maps for 4v4:  dm_caverns_r1 should make the 4v4 list, it's big enough and seems perfect for 4v4 play. dm_warlock, like bio i haven't played to much 4v4 on it, but from what i have seen it seems very fun and fast paced.  dm_lostvillage_two is a fun map, Althou i still have issues with maps made by clans because of DGC, but i think it's safe to say this is a good map for 4v4 play.<br>
<br>
A lot of people don't like dm_aftermath,  althou i really like the flow of the middle of the map, it's just that invisible wall that messes everyone up i think....althou it's made by valar maybe he wouldn't mind tweaking it a bit,  I like the 2 rockets,  It seems like a better version of dm_7hour (only other map with 2 rocket areas)  which can even out the gameplay.  IMO maybe rework that outside area somehow, and make that wall a bit more see thru....Althou i think people just need to let the map grow on them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

* there are two versions of warlock mind you - dm_which is a pub version and tdm_warlock which is optimized and tweaked for competitional matches.<br>

Bio_hazard too big for 4v4 IMHO<br>
<br>
Would like to see what the new aftermath is like.  I agree that the long narrow hallways are not the best for comp play.  I too felt the dam area was kind of big and open with not enough weapons to counter the RPG in there.  Dont get me wrong its a nice looking area, but I would think in a match it would probably be avoided as its so open you wouldnt want to go out there and just get RPG spammed.  It would be very very hard to overcome an RPG team in there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Island17 would be good for 2v2 because there isnt enough weaps and health for 4v4.  It is big enough for 4v4, but IMO it would need to have the shotty next to the xbow moved somewhere else, a second xbow, a few more nades scattered around and one more orb somewhere (I could only find one).  Also I have seen a version of that map where there was a ladder in the red shed on the beach that I think should be replaced as it allows you do come up from the beach under cover.  I couple more health packs in the buildings and some suit pickups and I think it would be good as a 4v4.  I think though that it would play very much like Avalon and I dont know if we want another map that plays so similar to that one.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Most are either killbox type or make great pub maps that dont really work all that well for match maps.  Icepick was a newer map that was taken out of the rotation because I lot of people complained about it.  It also seems that there are some people that wont play unless some of those tired, overdone maps are in there.

You want to talk about a map that SUCKS, Steamlab SUCKS no rhyme or reason to it.  Runoff is a crappy map too and the damn bomb feature would be just LAME in a match.

And it didnt have 5849392002 mines. The spawns would be backwards too. Power house is a control map but it's not nearly as well balanced as something like Zeta where you can attack from every angle and the surplus of supplies are not so easily guarded. The map is also fairly demanding on FPS but it has no excuse to be really, it is an indoor map with not that much going on. Power house like most of the stock maps would not get a second glance if it did not come with the game and get distributed to everyone, and hence run in FIOS and other leagues. That switch would definitely help though but why bother when we have alot of maps developing here and just plain many better choices.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

BTW, weren't a few of the stock maps winners of early mapping competitions or something? i'm pretty sure DM came out with, or followed by, only OW and LD...while the rest added only later. i may be wrong tho.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, I seem to remember that dm_resistance won. God knows it wasn't due to the amazing weapons placement... And I think dm_underpass was in there too. That one has it's flaws too, but nowhere near as bad as resistance if you ask me.<br>

Both are awesome looking maps, mind you...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yes resistance, powerhouse and underpass were the winners of the map contest and all of them while decent looking were poor playing maps. The sad thing is other maps that were sent in for the contest included swamplight, avalon, and zeta. So it's not like they did not have good maps to pick from they just decided against them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

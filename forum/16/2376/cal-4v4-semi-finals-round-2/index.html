Well, upon further review, it turns out you filed the FW and not them. I'm not one to bitch and moan about something as stupid as HL2DM playoffs, especially considering that my team was nothing but a bunch of randoms playing for fun, but it would be nice if we could say that we made it to semi-finals AS a bunch of randoms playing for fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

special thanks to sw for making us all wait around for your alligations to be resolved only to have you forfeit, after teams were nice enough to play make up matches against you during the last week of the season so you could get into the playoffs.  class act all the way.  misfits may suck but atleast we show up to every match and play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i dont understand either.  if grain is supposedly the person in question(the reason for the cal playoff hold up) then why is 2v2 still on hold and 4v4 is going?  he plays in both.  the community has got no diffenitive answer on what happened, now teams are forfeiting playoff games???  teams that didnt make the playoffs are now in after the first round was played?  i think a lot of us would atleast be satisfied with some sort of statement from cal admins as to wtf is actually going on here</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Wow you guys...you've had over a week to administer final decisions and shore up your problems, you know I like you Ko and I don't think you have anything to do with this long delay but action needs to happen and maybe a head needs to roll for next CAL season. I'm crossing my fingers that the extra long delay has nothing to do with LukeGT supposedly being out on a family vacation until soon....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
fairly sure i would've been told things like this, but then again I could be wrong, just like I would've been expected to be told that playoffs were starting via talk in IRC or a post on DMU and I wasn't and as such we weren't able to field a team at all. i'll wait for another official CAL post on the site to see what's really going on though.<br>
<br>
edit: then again I can play the rumour-mill game too and say that I hope ninoj is just catering to the players too much and making a mistake and not wanting to restart the playoffs before a final decision is made on grain out of fear that he may get banned!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

...If nino did anything it most likely wasn't for grain, he has lots of people bitchen at him like me because our team is already short on players and most likely will not be able to play in playoffs just like FLaS...<br>

This is the story here guys.  No playoffs should be played at this time.  Therefore any results or forfeits will not stand.  The team standings are the same as they were before the postponement of the playoffs unless a team leaves.<br>
<br>
The time delay resulted from the difficulty that Grain had in uploading his demos to the CAL site.  I offered my fast DL as an alternative then it took time to get them to the people who should have them.  It takes time to watch and analyze 16 demos, its not something that can be done in a day due to the fact that that type of work can be tiresome.  Then Memorial day weekend happened and some of us were out of town.  I agree this is taking longer than it should, but it is just circumstance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

it was a comment made out of jest, attacking a CAL admin who has no history of any corruption at all and is easily the best head admin HL2DM has ever seen with random rumours is stupid<br>

"Oh, and keep praying that I'll be banned Seagull, that way you won't have to lose again. You have no proof, you have people turning against you, you're starting to realize that this isn't going to end in your favour, and you're still trying to prove that I hack. Just give it up."<br>

When I was in elementary school there was a kid named Andy Morgan who got his face rubbed in the dirt by a girl named Rebecca Samuels.  He went around for 2 weeks after that trying to convince everyone that she smelled like ham.  He finally gave up the ham ploy since she didn't really smell like ham.  Not many people remember the ham ploy, but they do remember him crying and spitting dirt and his dad coming to pick him up from school after he pissed his pants right after that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Once the windows are broke and the "super laggy window break bug" is overcome by breaking all the windows with one explosive, what is the problem?  Old windows were gay and made dumb noise and impeded certain shots.  The new ones, break them, and its smooth sailing the rest of the way.  It's like an infomercial, SET IT AND FORGET IT!!!<br>

	<div class="content">If theres anything about r3 that has to be fixed, it's the dam vent. I get stuck every single time I go in there and I don't even speed crawl.<br>
No matter how careful I am to not touch the walls of the vent, I will get sucked into it everytime. To make matters even worse you can even get sucked in to the vent and become stuck just by crouching at the vent entrance if your ass rubs up against it. <br>
Now I can honestly say I have lost a match because of this, and I wasn't even trying to go in the vent and that blows. Also Ive never seen the lag caused by breaking the windows, but obviously some have. I think the window break/lag bug could be server related since I can't reproduce it on my server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sorry again this rule is silly.  You don't see Css not using cs 1.6 maps in fact they love them.<br>
Dods uses almost all dod 1.3 re-make maps in the finals the first season it was available.  Most all of Q4 maps are from Q3.<br>
Forcing Cal to use hl2dm only maps isn't going to force the mapper to make new maps, and the league isn't going to get new players based on the fact that the only maps in hl2dm are hl2dm only.  In fact if some Q4 maps were used you might get some more q4 players.  So what is the point?  As long as some things are changed and works in hl2dm we should use it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Its not really a rule but has sort of become a policy and I have to say that I agree with Nino in that I think its silly.  IMO If its a good map, its a good map.  Who gives a rats ass whether it was a remake from Q4 or whatever.   With mappers moving away from making HL2DM maps, not the other way around (VALAR We love you!!), and many inexperienced new mappers recently making maps that are either too small, not well balanced or just plain crap, we cant afford to turn our nose up at a well balanced, fun to play, good (sometimes great) map just because the actual architecture of the map is based on a Q4 map.  The weapons and weapons placement are still different enough that I dont see where it can possibly give any player or team an advantage.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Maps like Octagon, Feudal and so forth that can't be in cal due to being remakes.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I think CAL should have the policy that if there is a choice between two strong maps, they will take the original and not the remake, but remakes should not be excluded.<br>
<br>
It's not really fair to have the policy and then make exceptions for bio and lv anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Main point is that many players want to see one unified NA league, and right now CAL is the most active and established league out there.<br>

This is a public forum and our philosophy is generally not to censor, unless the thread looks like it is going to turn into an all out flame war.

The whole point of this league as I understand it, is for clan's that CAN handle more than 1 match per week. Most active clan's play several scrim's every week to keep in practice, and usually are getting on steam freind's asking for scrim's. How is this taking anything away from CAL?  <br>
<br>
If your clan wants to play scrim's on a regular basis, give it a chance.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">idk why having two leagues is such a big deal. I dont know arm to defend him against any of these accusations but to say that having 2 leagues is bad for HL2DM is retarded, and i don't care who i offend by saying that.<br>
<br>
If anything I hope the competition between the two strives both to become better, CAL needs several improvements, this warzone thing is far from perfect, especially since some of the teams i see registered on it don't appear to be playing on CAL which requires an AC. Kind of throws out the opinion posted earlier that CAL just didnt have enough to offer to teams that scrim every day, when you're participating souly in any even smaller league with the potential to have even less activity. Doesn't do much to smooth over my suspicious of this unnamed team.<br>
<br>
Dallas has always been a pretty cool guy to me, never had a problem wth him, and hes always been very straight forward and fair to my knowledge, and i trust he'll make the right calls to keep this league fair and clean. <br>
<br>
i wish the best for both leagues.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

BUT everytime I come on here its nothing but bitching, whining, and putting each other and their ideas down.  So what if somebody is trying to start a 3v3 league? CAL doesn't have one and im sure the ppl that started it did it with the best intensions.  If we are community we should encourage league creation and play.  Seems like the people that started that league have got nothing but shit for it.  doesn't make any sense to me.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused">  :evil:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Having said that, each of us as players is entitled to an opinion. Unfortunately there will be a certain amount of bitching on these forums because a. it's the nature of gamers and b. we don't censor or moderate as heavy handedly as other forums.<br>
<br>
The only real concern here is division in the community. ie. people dont like CAL or whatever the leading league is, they form their own, taking all the teams that agree with them along and creating more division in HL2DM.<br>

I am not saying that is what this new league is intendingor doing, I am just saying it is a concern for any new league that comes along.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Joyride was in 1v1 for a season, though it was a bit large and didnt see much play. It should actually play quite well 2v2; decent flow, clean brushwork / movement and good pickup / prop amounts.<br>
<br>
Warlock is far too random and cramped, and the many sawblades + long narrow passages isnt a good combo. It plays better as a pub. There are also a number of clipping issues that need fixing before its solid for league play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I still stand by dm_lostarena as it has been requested in many 2v2 scrims i have done over the off-season.  I went through my ss's and i have about 14 scrims on it (that i ss'd anyway).  I thought it would be a shoe-in for 2v2 but it has been shot down.  Even did a 4v4 just to see what that was like, although i don't recommend that for league play at all.  I think 2v2, it plays well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It has plenty of pickups, just a different proportion of things.  It will offer a different type of play that won't be the RPG, SMG nade whore fest that most of the other maps have.  I suspect the main opposition is the fact that it has no RPG.  For those of us that aren't  enamoured with the damn RPG, it might be nice to have a  map or two where the RPG is not the backbreaker of the other team and you have to race to get control of it first or the match is basically lost.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

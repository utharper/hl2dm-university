Thats 13 teams that made it through the season.  I'd just like to say to each player,  THANK YOU.  And i really hope that everyone had fun this season.  I also hope that everyone Returns next season As I have been Already asking and advertising for the upcoming season.  I have 4 new 4v4 teams that have said they would join, and 2 more that are thinking about it.  So teams that didn't make playoffs if you wanna pm me.  I can get you some scrims with some of these new teams to get ready for next season.<br>
<br>
Once again Thanks to all that played in Season 4.  You have until Sunday 12:59 pst to finish make-ups.<br>

	<div class="content">I wish someone could explain something. MFYA never even played Team V. They forfeit lost.<br>
So how is it that they have played all their games or had two FORFEIT WINS?<br>
<br>
I thought replacement matches were for Forfeit WINNERS?~?~<br>
<br>
Why should a team be allowed to Forfeit lose so they can just pick another opponent, waste folks time, not show up or communicate, and then turn it all into a real win.<br>
Seems FUCT to me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Impala needs some medication,  i was out of town for a long time after my 2v2 team had 2 forfiets.  I thouhgt the team went inactive, i apoligize nate went mia on me.  But this pieces of work starts attacking me on steam friends.  Now that i've seen alot of his posts i have come to the conclusion that at his age he should not be acting like an angst ridden teenager.  So back to the first statement maybe some zoloft could help.  <br>
<br>
Sorry i know i don't speak up to much in the community but i've been around alot longer then alot of people.  Some of these people attitudes are realy startin to piss me off.<br>

Step away from the computer gramps and start acting your age.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Cal rates are shit...<br>
<br>
I have seen a few cal matches recently, and wat i have noticed is that their configs allow for gay rate changing which seems to account for gay hit reg in matches. I also downloaded their configs, and imo, they are farked. Take note, cause i am not bias, i never have an prolly never will play in a cal match, i would also like someone to test my rates on their server <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
If everybody is sending the same amount of packets to the server then the lag compensation will all be calculated the same and hit reg would be fine, or atleast everything will be stable. As it is i think  its possible ppl are both intentionally and unintentionally causing shit hit registration.<br>
<br>
If its 33 tick, enforce something like the following.<br>
sv_mincmdrate 		"33"<br>
sv_maxcmdrate 		"33"<br>
sv_minupdaterate 		"33"<br>
sv_maxupdaterate 		"33"<br>
sv_minrate 		"20000"<br>
sv_maxrate 		"20000"<br>
sv_unlag 			"1"<br>
sv_maxunlag 		"1"<br>
sv_client_cmdrate_difference 	"0"<br>
sv_client_interpolate 		"1"<br>
sv_client_max_interp_ratio 	"2"<br>
sv_client_min_interp_ratio 	"2"<br>
sv_client_predict 		"1"<br>
<br>
Or u could go 30/20 if it causes choke, but its pure crap to let ppl use rates higher then the servers tick rate, wat good on gods gay earth could that do?<br>
Cal league configs allow anywhere up to 100, that aint right, its way off.<br>
Seriously, if hit reg is off, in a competition.....GAY! <br>
<br>
I have tested rates on lan (not quite the same i know) and i find that enforcing the same rates on everyone works best, and settings ur rates to 100, on lan, on anyhting = fucked, it should not be allowed, 66 MAX!<br>
<br>
The IDEAL situation would be a 66 tick server where u could enforce 66/66, but obviously thats never going to hapen, so i think something like the following would do much better, though not perfect, LANS PWN!<br>
sv_mincmdrate 	                     "30"<br>
sv_maxcmdrate 		"66"<br>
sv_minupdaterate 		"20"<br>
sv_maxupdaterate 		"66"<br>
sv_minrate 		"20000"<br>
sv_maxrate 		"30000"<br>
sv_unlag 			"1"<br>
sv_maxunlag 		"1"<br>
sv_client_cmdrate_difference 	"0"<br>
sv_client_interpolate 		"1"<br>
sv_client_max_interp_ratio 	"2"<br>
sv_client_min_interp_ratio 	"2"<br>
sv_client_predict 		"1"<br>
<br>
Now i think that having updaterate at 66 specifically could still cause problems, but hopefully moreso for the person stupid enough to run higher rates then his connection can handle =\ Same goes for cmdrate but generally that can be higher with most connections.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

when u run the cal config its changes the rates, so yes.<br>

i havent had a problem with them, infact we run the district with the cal config 24/7 (our server.cfg however is not running sv_pure 2 until the calconfig is loaded so people can still spray), but to make sure your server runs 100% awesome: fatpipeserver.com</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Interesting if these settings could have a real impact on hit reg. Will test a little and see what ppl playing says. I thought the main reason for bad hit reg was irregular ping since the server calculates what the player does based on the assumption that his ping is the same now as it was the last instant.<br>
<br>
I'm running a tick 66 server which has always felt smooth for movement, but at times hit reg has seemed off. I think my current settings are copied from the CAL server config:<br>
<br>
sv_mincmdrate 30<br>
sv_maxcmdrate 66<br>
sv_minupdaterate 20<br>
sv_maxupdaterate 66<br>
sv_minrate 5000<br>
sv_maxrate 25000<br>
sv_unlag 1<br>
sv_maxunlag 1<br>
sv_client_cmdrate_difference 40<br>

Almost no server I know of runs at 33 tick, especially those used for CAL. The vast majority are 66 tick. <br>
<br>
CAL rates don't allow you to rate hack so I don't see what the problem is letting people set their own within that range. Locking people at set rates would just make it good for some players and horrible for others which is hardly fair.<br>

	<div class="content">Cal configs allow for over 66, = stupidity, thats prolly the main thing, though, i would rather see everyones rates set to default, no advantage, no disadvantage....<br>
I know wat ppl say about rates and i ve heard and read that tecnical bullshit, but that bullshit fails miserably, how ur computer sends data to the server is wat effects hit reg the most, hence why ppl with packet loss (alot of it) warp an shit, and even though u may not be jittery on ur screen ur packet loss or choke may not register on net graph, from my experience, higher then tickrate = fucked up hitbox's.<br>
<br>
And kingpin, my rates are default, its gay wireless ffs, though, i dont recall being hit very often and surviving, i remember like 2 times in one game, then again it may not look like im getting hit on my screen cause of the time difference and all. Ive had ppl shoot stuff, it goes past me on my screen and they are like, wtf etc, an im like, no, not on my screen ^_^, but on the flipside, i often die from stuff that is missing me on my screen and b4 they shoot the physics on my screen ie i die, then the objects gets shot at me ...its weird.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

so what's that 66 tick?<br>

also sorry if this is slightly off topic but I'm rate confused... <br>

I use:<br>

Update Rate  66<br>

good or bad? could I improve them?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

also, what do you recommend for 100 tick? I know this game wasn't meant to be played at that tick rate but some people on CU seem to prefer it, therefore I have to life with it  :roll:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

A 66 tick server will be limited to a high of 66 cl_updaterate (but some 66 tick servers set their max sv_updaterate to 60).

One interesting thing actually, i remember having a short conversation with janek about hit registration and netcode, he said that in theory, the netcode should be good, but it fails, especially wen u crank up player movement speed like in hl2dm pro.<br>
I think, wat should hapen, is the player sends packets to the server, and then the servers smooths them out if necesary..then sends players co-ordinates to the rest of players on server, though, im no programmer so maybe that could cause problems <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> I cant even pretend to know why they do things the way they do, but one thing is for sure, they dropped the ball on this one, even older games have better hit rego then hl2..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This meant, if you shot something straight on it was a hit, which you then told the server "hey server, I hit".

<br>
That is when you realize that even low ping causes lag and what you see is not necessarily what you get. Everything seems to run smooth, you think you are under cover, then realize you play the servers packets. The server is like "No you don't".<br>
Seems there would have to be some breakthrough in general netcode to fix HL2DM.<br>

	<div class="content">Yes, wat im saying though, as the server side shit isnt doing its job correctly, ie, if i have major packet loss and or high ping, hitbox's will be off, i will warp, etc etc, But if the server WAS actually handling things right that wouldnt hapen, especially the warping part, though, i guess to do it properly, the person with lag really gest the shit end of the stick as i have noticed in games that are made well for low ping online gaming.<br>
I think the problem is a combination of or just seperatly ....hitbox's and player positioning ie how the server passes on player co-ordinates......<br>
I have noticed that in TF2, the hit reg is much better, but if u lag enough still, u will get some bad hit reg, and sometimes its bad, but not as often as in hl2dm. Obviously they have inproved it, but not perfected it, and u still see the ocasional player warping around in tf2, but it takes more lag to warp u in that game, which i think is a clue as to how they inproved on it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Now days and since 1108 in HL1 the lines of who does what have been heavily blurred. The big difference has been the addition of lag compensation. The server receives a message of your shot and angles and then calculates where the player was at the time you took the shot. Client side prediction has also gone way up in use. I can move around quite a bit without getting a packet to the server. When the server finally receives my packets it moves me around like a speed hack. I think the combination of all these things just has not been worked out well in valves case and may even be to complicated to work out well. In the end cheating is possible and works well in all games so maybe we should just go back to all clientside.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I have to disagree with this. I have my 66 tick server set to allow a max update rate of 100 as well as a max cmdrate of 100, when I set my client to 100/100 netgraph still shows 67/67. I also don't believe you can correct the problems with 100 tick by settings. I used to have a 100 tick at one time and I tried everything I could think of, nothing would prevent the lifts in aim arena from killing you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Someone wanted to know about sv_interp_ratio or something like what the -1 meant.  It means that the client can change there interp ratio but if set to 1 they can't.<br>
<br>
Ticrate and fps ultimately controls your cmdrate/updaterates.  Sure you can set them client side or force them server side.  But lets say everyone was forced to 100 on both and client side they had it all set too 100..<br>
<br>
pull down console and type net_graph 3.  Look at the area that shows in/out the IN is updates coming from the server and OUT is client updates being sent to the server.  All the way too the right you will see two numbers fluctuating anywhere from 0-101.something never will go higher than 101.something O.k there might be a slim chance it will go to 102..<br>
<br>
Anyway those numbers at the right are how many updates you truley are recieving that second and the amount of updates you are truly sending that second.  <br>
<br>
The number all the way to the right on the IN line should be close to these numbers below..<br>
100 ticserver - 101.something is what you should get from the server if not then the server isn't running good or you are choking.<br>
66 ticserver - 67.something is what you should get from the server if not then the server isn't running good or you are choking.<br>
33 ticserver - 34.something is what you should get from the server if not then the server is running on dialup lol hahahahhahaha...<br>
***note that default setting for sv_maxupdaterate is 60.. so some of you running 66tic servers will only get 66 on the right<br>
unless you change it to sv_maxupdaterate 66 for 66 tic or 100 for 100tic..<br>
<br>
The number all the way to the right on the OUT line should be this<br>
FPS controlls this along with ticrate.  <br>
100 ticserver - you should get 101.something as long as your fps is not going below 100fps if it drops so will your updates you send.<br>
66 ticserver - you should get 67.something as long as your fps is not going below 67fps if it drops so will your updates you send.<br>
33 ticserver - you should get 33.something as long as your fps is not going below 33fps if it drops so will your updates you send.<br>
<br>
Pinging over 90 can cause less updates as well sometimes.<br>
<br>
You can't send or recieve more than the ticrate of the server.  You can't send anymore updates then frames rendered.  Hence why FPS is more important then most people think.<br>
<br>
Rate setting is merely a cap of the amount of bytes per second you allow the server to send you.  Why this can't be higher than 30000, 25000, 20000 is beyond me.  I know in CS:S my clan I was in ran a 100tick server always complaining cause people had choke etc.. Was always told to lower cl_updaterate to 66 or something But I told them that was stupid why have a 100tic server if you can't run it at cl_updaterate.  So I looked into it.. And pulled the 20000 rate cap off the server forced everyone to a really high rate(rate 70000) now nobody in the server complains about choke anymore.  this isn't a problem in 66tic servers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line to make it easier.  I would put these settings in the server<br>
sv_maxupdaterate 100<br>
sv_minupdaterate 33<br>
sv_maxcmdrate 100<br>
sv_mincmdrate 30<br>
sv_maxrate 70000<br>
sv_minrate 20000<br>
**The ticrate will automatically force 66 updates for a 66tic server so the settings won't hurt nothing...<br>
<br>
Clientside<br>
Rate 100000<br>
cl_updaterate 100<br>
cl_cmdrate 100<br>
**The ticrate and FPS again will controll what you really send and recieve and rate setting is almost always forced in the server.<br>
<br>
<br>
**Oh and aslong as you have a 256k up and down connection.. you won't lag or not get updates that is plenty of bandwith.<br>
<br>
Heck goto a bit calulator and convert 40000bytes into kbits and see for your self.. It would be rare if anything you played in hl2 would go over 40000bytes..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">as long as your server can hit 300fps or more you can run a ticrate of 100 no problem(of course commons since tells you that you need high bandwidth as well duh).  How to tell what you server is running type stats in console or rcon stats..  Everyone in CS:S said that it runs buggy.  But I run a CS:S server for Rat clan and they hit awesome how I set it up.  They didn't at first cause they of clients having choke but I fixed that.   O.K let me explain in more detail.  In hl1 average size of update was 200 or less.  So lets say you are receiving 100 updates 100*200 = 20000 byte  which means you were never receiving more than 20000 bytes per second. So in HL1 setting rate 20000 was fine you would probably never choke if you had good Internet connection.  Now how big are the updates in HL2 will you can tell if you want. Look at the net_graph below<br>
<img src="http://www.ratclan.org/explained/NetGraph_files/image001.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
Section 3 shows the exact size of the update at that time.  So it moves all the time.  You take the highest number you've seen multiply it by the ticrate of the server and that is what you should set your rate setting at or about 10000 more in my book.   I can say that I have seen that go up to 700 and higher in CS:S but haven't watched it in hl2 very close but I will.   Lets say the server is sending 100 updates/s(100tic) if you do the math 100*700 = 70000.. So that is 70000bytes the server is going to try to send you.  If you have your rate set to rate 20000 then the server is going to stop sending you updates cause it would have reached the 20000 byte cap you set.  Causing choke.  Now that would be for a 100tic server lets do a 66 ticserver 66*700 = 46200 you would still choke if you set it to rate 20000 but alot less then a 100tic server.   Bottom line the only bug for a 100tic server is that people set there rate setting too low and servers force the sv_maxrate to low.  Which when you force a low rate setting you make the clients have to lower cl_updaterate to get rid of there choke.  Which makes hit reg go down.<br>

bandwidth as per say like 5mb down and up doesn't make a difference per say or lan..<br>
<br>
But if you set your rate low it will cap you to low you have to understand this.  If you still have the rate capped at 30000 then even on a lan you will have problems..<br>
<br>
Here not all this is right but the graph shows what bandwidth you cap your self if you don't set the rate and sv_maxrate setting right.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.ratclan.org/explained/rate.html" class="postlink">http://www.ratclan.org/explained/rate.html</a><br>

  So yea bandwidth does make a tad difference but if you never change the rate setting nor the sv_maxrate setting higher then you will have problems.. Same goes if the client never changes his rate higher...<br>
<br>
ON our ratclan server I had to force people so that they woudl stop complaining.<br>
<br>
forced them to rate 70000<br>
cl_updaterate 100<br>
cl_cmdrate 100<br>
on a 100 tic server <br>
<br>
and they don't choke they may lag but due to loss not choke.  Also the hit registry is perfect.<br>
<br>
anyway uping your bandwidth won't due crap.. cause you are using your rate setting to cap you bandwidth anyway.<br>
<br>
I am not saying I know everything but at least test this completely before assuming it is wrong.  Cuase I have tested it and I am about to test it in hl2dm as soon as I talk our clan into uping it to 100tic<br>

make sure there server is setup right and client is setup right on all players and hit reg should be good and choke should be none.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

ONe of the reasons you choke in a 66tic server is that you can't set your rate higher than a certain number.<br>
<br>
When you go into a server that you get choke pull down console and type rate and hit enter.<br>
<br>
If you set your rate higher then what the server is blocking.  You will get something like this:  Your rate is set at 50000 but the server is forcing you to 20000.  IF the server forces you to a low rate there is no way for it to work.  SO to fix choke you have to lower cl_updaterate if the server forces you low.   I doubt you read a rate guide saying what I say.   Most of the rate guides took what they knew in cs 1.6 and copied it over.  But I will show you a demo it will have to be CS:S because I don't have access to a 100tic server for hl2dm..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Just remember although you might beable to pull down console and type rate 100000 it won't show you that your are forced lower unless you type rate with nothing after it and hit enter.  But it won't show you that it is forced lower unless you change your setting higher than what it forces you to.  For example if your rate is set to 30000 and the server forces you to 30000 then when you type rate and hit enter it won't say anything.  But type rate 100000 and then type rate and hit enter then it will show you that it is forced.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I picked a 20 player server running overwatch yesterday night, thinking it would show high numbers. And for sure, I saw it hitting 1600+ on occasion. When you have close to 10 players in view and lots of props and grenades flying it surely bogged down the max rates allowed by the server. I tested a regular killbox server too, 10 ppl showed 1000+ occasionally.<br>
So, on a 66 tick this means anything from 70,000 - 110,000 rate is needed with that many players. If you, like me, run an ordinary European match server you'll never see more than 6 ppl actually playing at the same time and I'm guessing you'd be fine with 50,000 then. I'm currently testing to force it to 50 and allow 100 and wait to see what ppl say.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

keep doing the math.. you can go higher.  I haven't tested this setting cause it seems to be alot different then old HL.  and setting it to cl_interp_ratio 1 seems to be fine for me and probably 50% or more force this to that setting anyway.  I think cal forces this setting as well.  I think if it is anywhere close to being alittle like old HL that this should be adjustable cause it should have something to do with a persons lag.  But also if you receive loss go ahead and try to set this setting higher should help.<br>
<br>
Interpolation means to go back in time that many seconds to calculate a guess on whats happening in the game if you don't recieve an update.<br>
Extrapolation is about the same accept it just guesses without useing updates to calculate.  If you don't interpolate then you extrapolate.<br>
<br>
If you take cl_interp_ratio 1.0 cl_updaterate 100 interpolation = 0.010 - with updaterate set at 100/s then you recieve an update every .01 seconds.  so with interpolation = .01 seconds you would be going back to the very last update.  In old HL we liked higher interps maybe because we thought if it had more updates to calculate with it would be better.<br>
<br>
WOW just had a theory in my head...  I will post it later after I research it.  See if anyone will help me test it..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Do remember tho you can set your rate to 100000 remember server do force this sometimes to 30000 or less so you will still have to lower cl_updaterate in those servers to clear up the choke.

	<div class="content">Doesn't Cal force cl_interp_ratio 1 which = 1/cl_updaterate or ticrate(still need to test this)<br>
<br>
<br>
Basically the formula is this cl_interp_ratio divided by cl_updaterate or ticrate which ever is lower = cl_interp  I will know if this is 100% correct by saturday.  I know the formula is correct.  just don't know if ticrate plays a part.<br>
<br>
Old Skool HL players that used to play with cl_updaterate 100 and ex_interp .05 if you want to use those settings you would have to set cl_interp_ratio to 5  that would change your cl_interp to .05<br>
<br>
Find a server to play on that doesn't force cl_interp_ratio and play with it.  type cl_interp_ratio 5 or whatever then type cl_interp and hit enter to see what it sets it at.<br>
<br>
But remember the interp you remember in hl1 is different in hl2.   Like if you set ex_interp .01 in hl1 people would start skipping and it would look laggy cause you would be hardly interpolating.   Now the typical default setting for hl2 is cl_interp .01 and you don't skip at all it is smooth.<br>
<br>
I quick definition of interp = the amount of time in seconds in the past to interpolate(which means to calculate a educated guess on what is going on in case you don't receive and update).   Most everyone thought this had something to do with aiming in the past<br>
<br>
So if cl_interp is set to .01 and  you are recieving 100 updates a second then you are receiving an update ever .01 seconds.  So if an update doesn't come then you interp the update by going back .01 seconds in the past to make a good caluclation on what that update should have been.  Its valves way to make online play smooth and not laggy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ok, good to know.  If you did turn it off, does cl_interp continue to do anything?   I remember reading something a long time ago on a CSS forum about a sort of rate hack where you set cl_interpolate to 0, and then used cl_interp to essentially let you go back in time.  The way it was described was you could camp and focus on a doorway.  When someone ran by, you could shoot after they had already passed and hit them.  That's why I was wondering if you do turn off interpolation, does it matter what your cl_interp settings are.  May be a moot point if most servers don't allow you to turn it off.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No what cl_interpolate does is turn on and off interp.  SO setting it to 0 turns it off that means every thing you see should be realtime.  So if you see someone in a door way they would probably not be there for real cause you would be behind cause of lag(ping). Well maybe not the server has lag compensation too.  I haven't really tested it going by theory.  But supposidly if you don't interpolate(interp) then you extrapolate which is a compensation but it doesn't calculate a guess it just guesses.  So it is better to interpolate then extrapolate.  I don't know if they took extrapolate out in hl2 or not since I haven't seen a setting.<br>
<br>
Anyway in theory turning off cl_interpolate will not let you hit someone after they left.  That can happen even with interp on.  Cause of lag.  Most high pingers get that to happen alot.  Anyway I don't have any solid proof that could say that is true or not.  But in my mind it isn't possible.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I took at look into interp and interp ratio.  I found no real way to prove any setting to be better.  Based on opinion and what felt good when playing.  That cl_interp_ratio 1 or 2 felt good and 0 was the worse.  When we had our hl2dm server open so you could set interp even higher that from cl_interp_ratio 3 to 10 I felt hardly any difference.  Since I don't have anything that lets me know if it is working better or worse other than what I feel my shots are on or off.  My conclusion is that it would be up to the player to determine if one setting is better for him or another.  But I also know that 90% of the servers out there won't let you set it to anything but 1 or 2.  So that is really your only choices.  So the effects of interp isn't as important as your rate setting and getting rid of choke and loss.  I also was too lazy to make demos.  I will post my rate guide although probably doesn't look as pretty as the others but if you follow what I say you can test it and not need a demo from me.  I will try to list servers that stay kind of full and have no cap on rate so you can do your own tests.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

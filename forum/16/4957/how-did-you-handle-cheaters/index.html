	<div class="content">hello. i would like to know how the former admins of cal and idml and warzone and other leagues i forgot handled cheating matters.<br>
what was proof enough for you to ban someone from your league?<br>
(vac ban, hlstats ban, screenshots, chatwindows, demos, see someone posting in cheating forums, xray account, using skins on pure server, admitting with voice communications...)<br>
i am very interested in your opinions and experiences</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well how CAL was ran they used ACS, CEVO uses CMN3, and i forgot what ESEA uses but from about 3 years of playing competatively these programs never caught/detected anyone who didnt want to get caught. Of course they caught the obvious people who didnt try and hide it, but if the programs couldnt catch those people why even use it. I saw that on the CU forums you guys are going to start using x-ray, some anti cheat system i guess? I dont really think its going to make a difference if someone wants to cheat there going to do it and if they dont want to get caught there not going to get caught. Theres always ways around all anti cheat systems to not get detected, The only logical way i've seen that cheaters get banned faster is by experienced players, who know what there doing and take factors into consideration when viewing demos of the player ex. vent call outs, and just plain randomness. Also if someone comes out of nowhere and rapes everyone and has a 9 digit id, hes obviously an aliaser or cheating, considering the amount of people that still play this game and the amount of attention this game draws out to proffessional players, there wont really be new up and coming stars but then again someone could prove me wrong.<br>

anti cheat systems havent really proven to work better than the actual players when it comes to catching cheaters, but more of just take up a fuck load of resources on my computer</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 The grain dispute came not after a match loss at all but after scrimmages that had suspicious activity and if I recall right seagull won all the scrimmages. And those were not even close to the only 2 cheat disputes CAL had. If I was only that lucky. Most people who were disputed did not go blowing it open the community and posting on message boards / making a big deal out of it. Members of $W and other major clans were disputed. <br>
<br>
We received several cheat disputes per season. Most were bogus IE a total noob accusing someone of cheating for very basic things. But in every case the cheat dispute had to be looked into which meant combing over demos, and we never blew any of them off we at least took the opportunity to see if something suspicious was taking place even if the player was someone we never had any suspicion of. In CAL because it was a highly structured league with people over top of us there was a sequence of events. We of course had CAL ACS to detect cheating and on top of that everyone was required to take in game screen shots of the other players as well record demos. If a dispute arose demos were requested and admins had to go forward and look them over. This took many hours to do carefully because the only way people were going to get caught is if they did something very obvious. Unfortunately only the biggest idiots with sub 50 IQs would ever do that. After all those years no one was ever officially busted in CAL mostly because we as CAL admins aired on the side of it is better to let a cheater go then bust an innocent person. And due to the structure we could not really pull off alot of things. IE in CAL screen shots or chat logs outside of matches were not admissible evidence. In fact very little was allowed because any of those items could be faked. Most smaller leagues would not put up with this. <br>
<br>
There were a couple things worth mentioning. 1 HL2DM has no-one that I am aware of that is a good at looking through demos for cheaters. I quickly realized that I was in fact the expert in this community. A couple other guys were decent but most games have a couple guys who do it almost as a hobby and are very good at it. Usually they are not a member of any major clan and people tend to trust their opinion. 2. No one trusted me so I might as well have not existed in the anticheat system. I was infact the person who exonerated invx there was a very fishy scene which I figured out was a source TV error combined with a lucky spawn timing. Had I not been admin I am pretty sure invx would have been busted on that demo. The important thing to recognize is that anti cheat is fucking hard, and this community has much less experience and tools then it really needs. People who should not have been busted were almost busted, people who should have been busted have never seen a dispute filed against them. There is one player I pretty much knew was hacking and the problem was despite that we never lost to his team in a match so we did not waste our 2 disputes. Then later on he admitted it. No one else disputed and there are several players I was surprised never had a dispute filed  against them. There were also times we let people off who we really were pretty sure were hacking but like I said if it was not completely obvious then it was let go.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">hl2dm has been pretty horrible at anti-cheat.  Mostly because players have no other gaming background.  There were very few disputes in hl2dm NA period.   Cal CS and DOD is was pretty common,  if you have any thought of it, you disputed.  And one thing that hl2dm always missed the ball was a suspension was never handed down even if it could have.  Several times in dods someone would get disputed and have some crazy stupid excuse of why a demo was missing and just get a 3 month ban.   They usually caught the cheaters and hacking in scrims and pubs, although you needed the rcon status just like you would in any dispute.  Even the little stuff would get you a ban,  missing end round ss, missing net_graph 3, missing rcon status was all a 1 week suspension.  For the first time.   But look at all the trouble it took to get people to load irc in hl2dm.  Shit when i was in sta I had a well known hl2dm team that was pretty good get mad that I told them they had to enter there steam id's into the system before they could play.  So they got mad and quti sta.  <br>
<br>
Shit in dods my team beat this css team that disputed my team because they were mad.  We had all of our ss's and demo's but I forgot the rcon status from the second round.  So the match was overturned and the team leader (me) and manager got 1 week suspension.  Dods had a lot of cheating and it normally wasn't until after the fact.  But a lot of the nit picking for the little stuff kept it clean for the most part and at least you can catch some people.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Gut feeling is the best way to go about it IMO.  If someone just doesn't seem right when they play and isn't the same as everyone else in a certain way and it seems fishy, gtfo.  Also, if the person is disliked by a lot of the community and is an asshole or something, that's just added benefit to kicking their asses out.  Majority rules if people don't like you you're out, that's how I think it should go.<br>
<br>
And a lot of people claim bad connection or something and that's why they're so weird.  Well, gtfo for that too.  Would a Honda Civic be allowed to race against formula one cars? No, cause it'd have no chance.  However, in this game it seems that having a bad connection helps you rather than hurts you in many ways, which is completely retarded.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I was told before how this kinda "system" used somewhat in TF2 and that it works well, it sounded good to me.  Much better than this stupid ass anticheat system hardcore proof bullshit we got/had going.  TF2's got a way bigger community though, 5 people wanting someone banned in hl2dm is pretty much the majority of the community so idk if there's a point to it.<br>
<br>
But, I've also seen firsthand that cheat accusations in this game do absolutely nothing and they're pretty much useless.  So, I hold my tongue and resolve to get better than those people even with their bs qualities.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
if i recall correctly the CAL season was put on hold for weeks waiting for grain to submit demos of CAL matches.  im pretty sure it was because of a CAL match in question.  lets just say for argument sake it wasnt.  if situations occuring outside of CAL league play arent "admissible evidence" it seems a little hipocritical to use them as the basis for that issue. further more, why would he have to submit CAL demos if it wasnt a CAL dispute in question?  when i was a CAL admin for a short time i dont ever recall seeing a section in the rules that stated a dispute can be filed during the CAL season(to the magnitude of putting the season on hold) because one suspect a player of cheating during "scrimmages that had suspicious activity".  also if you are the self proclaimed "expert in this community" on dectecting cheating and "HL2DM has no-one that I am aware of that is a good at looking through demos for cheaters" why was Luke the cheat admin? <br>
So by this logic the cheat admin would have no idea what he was doing unless guided by the only person who can do it, all the while the expert being a member of the same clan, the very same clan that filed the dispute in the first place, by a team member that wasnt a member of the clan but was recruited souly to help beat the team they accused of cheating based on evidence the isnt admissable?  that sounds acceptable. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i suspect the CAL ACS was not as robust of an anti-cheat system as it was billed to be.  perhaps thats why there was so much mystery as to how it worked and who had actual access to view the ACS goodies.<br>
<br>
i gave due dilligence to the only cheating dispute to come my way as an admin.  i must say, its not an easy process.  demo's are notoriously unreliable for viewing and re-viewing the same sequence of events.  turning wireframe on makes everyone look like a hacker at some point in any demo.  in the end, i could find no smoking gun for the specific kills suspected.  i had a high degree of confidence in all the kills being legit.<br>
<br>
then along comes voz with his "photoshopped" hacks.  and i got to looking at the menu options of the "photoshopped" hacks.  and i realized how sophisticated and scalable the hacks really are.  it just blew my mind.  nothing like the easily observable homemade hacks i'd seen adminning pubs.  the degree of subtlety that an intelligent hacker can make use of is just demoralizing.<br>
<br>
the solution i see is for a board/group/whatever to get "trained" up on all the latest, greatest hacks around.  and i mean really trained to scrutinize cheating.  develop a bank of known demos with known hacks/ers for this group to learn from.  even better would be for an admitted cheater to provide the lessons/examples to this group.  then, this group can be used to settle disputes in league play.  or server admins could tap into the group and get recommendations on player bans.  of course, there are a lot of problems with this approach too. <br>
<br>
another option is just to announce that all league cheating disputes are ruled upon by the preponderance of admins.  in other words... 51%.  teams know about the rule upfront and decide before the season starts if thats acceptable to them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

the solution i see is for a board/group/whatever to get "trained" up on all the latest, greatest hacks around.  and i mean really trained to scrutinize cheating.  develop a bank of known demos with known hacks/ers for this group to learn from.  even better would be for an admitted cheater to provide the lessons/examples to this group.  then, this group can be used to settle disputes in league play.  or server admins could tap into the group and get recommendations on player bans.  of course, there are a lot of problems with this approach too. .</div></blockquote>

this is actually not a bad idea CD.  security admins/developers, programmers, game developers etc hire the ppl they try to protect themselves from all the time.   BUT, they also sign NDAs and i dont see that happening in that group.  you would cerainly have leaks as to what the admins can currently detect, so in essence it would be counter productive.  this is why VAC doesnt ban hackers right away.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

and yes, I was pretty awful back then, and I'm still not great now. At the time the popular theory floating around was that ACS was just used to scare people and it didn't actually do anything.

Because I was on a very crappy computer at the time and I couldn't justify dropping down from 20-25 fps to 13-17 fps in times of intense action. Not to mention alt-tabbing to start ACS literally took like 10-15 minutes, assuming that I didn't crash from it. I know other people had similar problem too.<br>

I'm not sure why everyone's attacking me though.. I was just trying to contribute to the discussion that ACS didn't work, i.e. CAL wasn't even getting everybody to use it. Had I gotten banned for a week or something I would have rethought my not turning it on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Shortly after I left 911, I ended up having to play in a CAL match with them against eWR on amplitude.  me, da1, hertz (1 round), and someone else, herb maybe.  I recall 'Strange' picking up the 2nd match after Hertz left.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this was roughly my 2nd CAL match and I forgot to load the Anti-Cheat before starting my game.  SO i typed it to all in chat.  And now the funny part.  Most of eWR and 911 said "oh shit, me too" and reloaded their games.  apparently.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone used that thing reguarly, after reading this thread and experiencing that.<br>
<br>
@ Valiums, I no longer have demos of these match, I'm pretty sure u played for eWR in that match however.  Can you verify this?  I know Rico, PB, and Nutri was there.  I remember xbow-ing PB a lot while he camped Rocket and those shield pickups.  One of the more exciting matches I played in.  <br>
<br>
I do believe overall we only lost by like 5-8 kills.  If anyone has SS of this match, I would love to see them.  This was the same season as HL2DM + CAL = Joke.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Valiums never played for ewR.  He was on your team during that match. defme was the other person you were trying to remember.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>whitewolf wrote:</cite>One of the more exciting matches I played in. </div></blockquote> <br>
I remember it.  We kept wondering why we were playing because we had all given up on CAL at that point.  I think that we actually decided to just say "fuck off" to CAL in that match actually.  Grain and PB were lol'ing and arguing about something, I was lol'ing at them, and no one could hear defme, who was probably lol'ing at how ewR went about playing matches.<br>

You're arguing about a point from over 6 months ago, also I was referring specifically to the amount of registered HL2DM league players in US vs European CU, not the entire fucking world internet. There are in fact over 150+ European registered league players in CU compared to our small league scene.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

One thing about you Valiums is that you have a habit of always making an issue into another issue.<br>
I make a point, you make it 6 months old.<br>
You make an obvious point based on your very words and you play the i didn't make that point point.<br>
If i criticize something, i am a terrible Team Player.<br>
If i opine, i am old and washed up or drunk or retired or on vacation or 6months too late.<br>
Hell, nothing is ever valid for you. Only your opinion.<br>
I didn't bump this thread. I did the research for my own knowledge, seeing lots of disinformation about how fucking GREAT Europe is.<br>
I thought it would be interesting to see if you were right.<br>
And of course, you weren't. Continent has nothing to do with it.<br>
There are no "10 times the players" exaggerations of any sort.<br>
It's like everything else Valiums: Always shifting the subject, throwing out ad hominems, denying what you said.<br>
<br>
I am saying try to get hold of your mouth (or fingers, as it were).<br>
And frankly, i don't give a rat's ass what you like or not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Continent has nothing to do with it? Why does western Europe have roughly over twice the size of the United States in online gamers in broad statistics?<br>
<br>
I still have admin in CU and checked active players in leagues, there's actually over 200+ members playing in CU compared to the 80-90 some players in United States eFPS. Continenet has nothing to do with how many gamers play? I think you're wrong, I think there is a correlation between how many gamers there are depending on comparing the United States to Europe, statistics show this and I'm willing to copy and paste my CU admin active player priveledges to prove it even in HL2DM. In eFPS about 10-15 of the members are combined Russian/Latin American on top of it.<br>
<br>
BTW you are a terrible team player, you went about 20-50 the last draft scrim I had with you. An all around terrible player, terrible thinker.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

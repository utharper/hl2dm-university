The Admins still cant get into the admin sections of the CAL website.<br>

I asked one of the higher admins if they knew what was going on.<br>
The response was that the new owners are going through some legal mumbo jumbo and there is no idea when (or if) things will resume.<br>
Also the person I spoke too shared my and our frustration over it and said it was complete BS.  It should have been 2 weeks but its been a month.<br>

If CAL does resume, I wonder if its worth continuing with the current season or scraping it and starting over?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i think this has put the nail in the coffin anyway.  im pretty sure this is the end of competitive hl2dm play.  i mean, look at how many matches were actually played when the season WAS going.  maybe 15%........with 80% of the teams just dropping out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

well, as a famous inventory once said "i didnt fail 100 times, i successfully found 100 ways that didnt work"  <br>

	<div class="content">I doubt that not having the open division would have made any difference.  For 4v4, I am not sure that the teams that were active in 4v4 open would have stayed in main and you would have the same teams in main as you dor right now.  Even after I removed the BS CSS teams, main went one week where no matches were played at all and I had to announce that I would keep those matches open and the teams would have to figure out when to play them.   2v2 main did not fair much better.<br>
<br>
The fact still remains no matter what division you look at, matches are not getting played which tells me people are not into playing them or this game any more.  <br>
<br>
Especially now with the fuck up on CAL's end, is there a point in wasting everyone's time in trying to continue a dead league?   Does anyone still think DM will get moved to the OB engine and if it does will it even make a difference?<br>

totally agree.  but i think that it should be run:<br>
<br>
1-maybe saturday night?<br>
2-have a sign up list as a sticky, ppl can put their name down if they wanna play in that weeks matches.  have like a saturday morning roster lock.  then have a few ppl in charge of spliting the names into even teams, or a random draft maybe.  basically have it done ahead of time.<br>
3-also have a map vote list....NEW maps ffs, lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

at least offer some rotating nights for the draft.  my only fear about setting things up ahead of time, is people deciding they dont like their team and not showing up.  maybe set it up ahead of time but only announce the teams when they show up in vent.  pretty much anything is worth a try at this point.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Umm ya not the same at all Blas, not even close.  Dont get all but hurt.  I am not picking in 911, it is just that 911 happens to be the sponsor/creator/managment of Warzone.  If it was DND, EC, or any other clan/team I would feel exactly the same.   In fact DND tried to recruit us to some sort of league they were trying to do and I didnt get involved with them either.<br>
<br>
Just to get the facts straight, the regular (stock settings) CAL divisions had/has admins from $W, EE and Khaos (and at one time FLaS or Fusion, not to mention Bahlik before he bailed) plus add one more clan/team for the killbox divison (two before Tazzer had to resign).  Last I checked 3/4/5/6 does not equal 1, at least not in any number system I am familiar with.  The clan diversity would be greater if dependable people could be found from other teams and recruited, but alas they are hard to find.<br>
<br>
There are higher level admins that are not clan affiiliated to go to.  Unlike Warzone where pretty much one person from one team calls the shots and there is no one else to go to beyond that.  In CAL, if the majority of the admins brought an issue to the higher admins against another admin or the GM, you damn well bet they would listen.  <br>
<br>
Also, not that ACS is perfect by any means but CAL had that as an added feature.<br>

It is not the same period and I refuse to debate it further so don't even bother.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Seems like the perfect opportunity if you can get a neutral and mature person to be in charge, and preferrable follow the Clans-United model with a bunch of elected admins partitioning responsibilites amongst themselves. If you couple that with a decent turnover in the admin pool, you will quickly get several people who knows by practical experience what it means to run something like this and, hence, respect for the people currently in charge when they themselves are regular players again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The thing is that it has been 1 or two seasons where it wasn't dictatorship. When nix went away. Cu was flourishing till he once returned and then it went down again and now he's returning from time to time. The two seasons i stayed at the admin post before Nix got back was great with admins with voices from at least 5 different clans.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well this game needs a comp to keep it on the map as being something competitive. Frankly tho CU has been there for European players its never been anything big enough to be recognised in the gaming community and probably never will. Its served us in the absence of esl which brought in competitive players in the past but CU is still ameatur and really does open the game up to the rest of the gaming community.<br>
<br>
If the game going to be taken seriously it need to be part of a larger gaming community than it self. There was a opportunity in esl for hl2dm but no one really stepped up to the plate and so now it in control of admins that hardly play the game say the least it already failed before it started for us in europe. Now I'm sure esl do operate in NA and they have ran hl2dm comp before I don't know but I think if you get hold of them and offer them you have so and so x amount of players that are willing to play they can open comp down your end and hopefully you can get people in admin position that know the game and are level headed.<br>
<br>
As for ko well drama not to isolated CU from what I seen in the CAL had its own share of drama and it pretty much happens in most gaming community when things go wrong also don't ever use a poll on league decisions it mostly end up in a mess of hypocrisy. Also CU is dependent on the people running it if you got narrow minded peeps running it trouble starts. I still recommend getting a other gaming community to host hl2dm than going down the CU sort path but if you do you need a couple of things.<br>
1.good set of admins from as many different clans as possible also must be respected by the community.<br>
2.listen to the community mainly peeps that speak in adult way (has all ways been my rule to ignore flamer and trolls opinions)<br>
3.Try not to force things and keep the community well informed make them feel like they have a say<br>
4.avoid polls as all cost they can be manipulated and put admins in a corner on what they can do. You should really look internally between admins on what you should do usually have a public topic on it to help get idea what the community wants also it help identify real issues or just a moron with nothing else to do but complain polls don't show you this.<br>
5.good system in place <br>
<br>
and phantom as far as I know we do allow NA players but same reason why there was little EU players in CAL was due to time zones and you had to play on servers based there as well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

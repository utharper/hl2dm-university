	<div class="content">I always thought the same thing nino, its completely lame that the rosters are not wiped at the end of each season, and people are forced to sign up the next. It's as if it would be too much trouble for those who are really interested and want to play the next season to sign up again. Instead we get scheduled against bogus teams/players and get no preason match worth playing, might as well not have a preseason. The other major thing is that the few new teams who may have joined see that the league is complete trash when they get scheduled against these very teams who dont respond or exist. Iv'e been griping about this for 3 seasons now, doubt it will change anytime soon.<br>
<br>
My preseason match is against a guy who dosn't even play the game anymore, and hasn't been online in like forever. Ya that should be a great match.<br>
<br>
On another note can a admin please provide a download location for dm_milieu_r5 and lockdown_r5.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
What is your 2v team name and I assume you spoke to the 2v admin?  Chemicalburn is 2v2 admin now.<br>
<br>
Ya the versions were changed from r_4 without my knowledge.<br>
<br>
LD_r5 hasn't been posted, use r4 if r5 isn't  in place in time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Milieu_r5 should be on Valars website if not use r_4.   I believe he is on an r_6 but it hasn't been looked at yet.  I will post a link for both maps later tonight.<br>

Its preseason so its not critical yet.  Preseason is also to weed out the ones that don't play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is the wrong line of thinking, but one that I know has been placed upon you by others.<br>
<br>
Preseason could ruin the whole rest of the season or severely cripple it as a result of that thinking.<br>
<br>
One of the things Dallas really knew how to do right in warzone is to make sure that all the teams signed up would play, none of this bs where he makes legit teams do the admins job of "weeding out bogus teams"<br>
<br>
Hit the dam button, clear the rosters, please can ya ?<br>
<br>
Id rather see half the people on the teams list as long as they are active teams!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just so you know we have been going through therosters the last two seasons and deleting the old teams.  I did 2v2 last season myself and I did 4v4 this season.   I told the new admins to do the same if they were teams that we know they did not play last season.  I don't know what was done with 1v1 prior to that.  <br>
At least for 1v and 2v, ther are a lot of new sign ups as there always are.  It is impossible for the admins to know if the new teams are going to be legit or not until preseason.  If we just delete any new team simply because they are new and we don't know for sure they will play we will never get ant new teams.<br>
<br>
Before anyone says we don't get new teams anyway, Khaos was new not so long ago as was ewr and Veracity and flas.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">once again, damned if you do damned if you dont.  i originally had the 2v open punk.  and i did purge.  more than likely, i purged nino's team... iirc it's creation date was 2007.  and nino had just about disappeared from the community at the time i was purging.  i purged a LOT of teams based merely on date.  i purged bullshit names with only one or zero players.  i purged teams with expletives in their name.  i purged teams with pornographic pics.  and i banned one for repeatedly creating new teams after being purged... repeatedly.  so yeah, i was heavy handed.  and apparently, incorrect.  so nino... its my bad.  i thought you had directly contacted chem, and i didnt want to step on his toes since its his div now.  but i'll fix it tonight.<br>
<br>
and i don't get this whole thought process that admins are mindless minions.  sure, ive received technical guidance on how to circumnavigate the CAL backoffice.  but any decisions i made on purging in my division were pretty arbitrary on my part.  the ban was completely my own doing.  given what i've read in these forums in the past, i was actually quite shocked at the amount of freedom i have at making decisions within my own division.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Don't get me wrong, Im not trying to insult you guys or say you are mindless minions.<br>
<br>
Why put yourself through all the extra work of trying to figure out who is legit, who is a current team and or who is a inactive team from 3 seasons ago?<br>
<br>
The point is the cal backoffice is fubared in many ways, always has been, prolly always will be, you cannot rely on it to do this properly.<br>
<br>
 Eliminate all that bs and start over. That way only the people who truly are interested will sign up and sure the few that sign up now and are not serious or w/e can be weeeded out thru preseason. It just looks real bad when you have to start out with teams you know wont play, not to mention its putting you in a position to try to decide who is and who isnt going to play. Make people resign up and you eliminate 99% of the bs.<br>
<br>
From past conversations I have had with fearsome about this, its more like the players are seen as mindless minions when it comes to resigning up. As if we don't have the brains to do it and or the 5 mins it takes to do something which will greatly benefit the league.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Agree with Punk on seasonal resets. The only people who wouldnt sign up again are those who werent going to play anyway, so a wipe is pretty much all benefit and no loss, not to mention a whole lot less effort for the players and admins both.<br>
<br>
Links to the season maps in the cal files section would be good too. Very few players know where Valars site is, and almost none of the new players are going to be able to find anything linked from here, if they even know this site exists in the first place.<br>
<br>
On the bright side, we now have a new, often non-functional google calender sidebar! So all those complaints about the old sidebar apparently paid off.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you can't clear the rosters each season because then $w would lose it's roster.  So the mindless admins have to weed through the dead and fake teams glhf<br>
<br>
<br>
Could have moved the known and experienced teams to main but then it would look like fearsome took someones advice so he had to change it somehow and make it so anyone can join main.  And all css scrubs want is to say they are main.  so that equals 500 fake and bogus teams.  gg</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

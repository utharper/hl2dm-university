	<div class="content">doesnt the tiebreaker seem to be working wrong? i like the idea that each team gets to pick a map, but not totaling scores in a dm game for a match is retarded, maybe we should start planting bombs or rescuing hostages instead.<br>
<br>
<br>
i just lost a match even tho we had overall frags.. im not pissed or anything it was a GG, but if i won a match that way, to me it'dd be no different then wnning with a dispute or some lame shit like that, it should ALWAYS come down to frags.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You can't have map choice and total frags because different maps get faster kills than others. <br>
<br>
Say for example, one teams strong map is bio-hazard, thats a small fast paced map, they have more chance of extending the lead than a team who's strong map is lost village. Team 1 could get a decent lead in bio then play a slow round of loading up and camping village to win. By having to win both rounds you gotta go all out in both bouts, you cant use the round one lead to stall round two.<br>
<br>
This has been a controversial topic. Many players don't like this format. To go back to total frags you gotta use the same map all rounds for it to be fair. Even then, a team having a good first round can still stall for the win in round 2. I have never really likes the total frags method. I have won and lost too many matches by one or two total frags when a tiebreaker would have been much fairer.<br>
<br>
The argument many make is that if they went 40 - 20 in the first round then they  deserve that margin to be taken into account for how well they beat the other team. The only problem with that is when that lead was obtained in a control map like zeta. Consider two perfectly even teams. If on initial spawn, team 1 gets the center and team 2 spawns in the canal, it might take team 2 twenty deaths trying to get the center back from an RPG wielding fully suited organized team. Then if they go even the rest of the round they just lost round one by twenty frags due to bad luck. If round two is then lockdown and team 2 wins by five, did they really lose the who competition fairly? Each team has won a round, but the first team wins by 15 frags. Something doesn't seem right there to me. <br>
<br>
If I had to choose, I would have two rounds of 20, each worth 1 point, then a 10 minute tiebreaker, highest frags gets server or model choice in round 3, same map all 3 rounds.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">its sounds to me like your saying "because some teams are better at some maps then other teams"<br>
<br>
i get exactly what ur saying, but isn't that what it all comes down to? being better at your own map pick? if your better at playing a slower map, consider yourself boned for the other teams pick who plays far better on a smaller faster map, and strive to be better at playing a map like that.<br>
<br>
and when u put all that bullshit aside you still have the tiebreaker map, and most leagues have 1 or 2 to pick from, why not have 1 'slower' and 1 'faster' and the team with fewest frags gets 2 choose between the 2.. <br>
<br>
w/e you decide to do theres plenty of ways to avoid doing it gay like now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">That's exactly what I am saying. It comes down to preferences. Some clans are just way more experienced on certain maps because they run them and play them constantly. Play $W with frag counts and have em pick zeta = game over before it even starts. <br>
<br>
Making the faster kill rate maps more important in the competition is just gonna be a bummer for those clans who don't like those maps as much. I agree there are other ways of doing it. The problem with CAL is that no matter which method you use, someone doesn't like it. That's ok too, everyone has their opinion. <br>
<br>
What I dont like is when someone drops out of the league because they didn't like rule a or rule b, or one or two maps. Thats just weak.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The 2 main purposes of this format were firstly to allow teams to choose their maps, which also adds an extra strategy element as each team needs to consider the map they and the enemy are strongest or weakest on, and secondly to prevent the first round results from heavily influencing the second round as WT explained above.<br>
<br>
The main concerns with this format were the potential for one team to end up playing combine twice, and that teams would have to consider all the division maps at all times and couldnt just practice one map per week. <br>
<br>
The first point may or may not be valid; we will see how many matches are decided by who was combine twice as the season progresses, but remember that likely half the matches will never go to 3 rounds in the first place, the rebel team in round 3 gets server disadvantage, and the 2 round format also gives a skin advantage to the team that is rebel first, since, all other things being even, they could get a frag advantage round 1 and play conservatively round 2 for the win. The second point is moot; if teams arent willing to practice adequately on the various maps, theyre likely to pay for it with a loss. This is league play and teams are expected to learn and know the maps, most of which have been around for some time in any case and are well-known by the majority of competitive hl2dm players.<br>
<br>
Formats are set for the remainder of this season, but if there proves to be sufficient evidence that the formats or rules of any league are causing problems, theyll be reconsidered and addressed before the beginning of next season.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well, first off.  whether holy's id matched or not is mute.  he registered for the ewr roster after the 20th of december.  i think he signed up on the 22nd.  2 days after the deadline.  this is why they have trade deadlines in pro sports.  warzone is not the only league that has rules of this nature.  plus how hard is it to play with the account that you signed up with on the site.......?  im sure holy was waiting for my comments about this because we dont get along, BUT, i would have this opinion whether it was him or not.  EE had the same issue with EC, adding players right before our match started.  seems pretty simple to me, set your roster by the 20th and use the steam id you signed up with.  teams had like 2 months to do it.  <br>
<br>
on the flip side tho, i believe once the match starts both teams have aggreed that everything is legit.  i dont know if holy's steam id thing was argued before match start.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I agree with this. The match should be disputed before it's started if there's a problem.<br>
<br>
As for warzone, I knew this would happen too. Every league that's ever been started by da11as is just a place for 911 to win. Nobody has really ever had a chance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thank you for pointing that out.  The 4v4 admin did NOT approve that match.  He wasn't even asked.  In fact, we were told on at least 2 occasions that we were not allowed to do that, by our admin, who was on our team, and had to postpone matches, or wait until a player showed up to be able to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nothing. That is my response to that. Zilch.<br>
I never said Warzone was just for 911 to win like somebody else imputed.<br>
And i am not jumping on Rico's bandwagon.<br>
I don't do anything to curry favor with others.<br>
That should be apparent.<br>
Rico doesn't need me to speak for him and i don't need you in order to speak<br>

<br>
1. Ringers: Match ringers will not be tolerated. A ringer is a player who is playing under a different name/account when they are listed on a different team in the league. If a match ringer is suspected notify Warzone officials immediately.<br>
<br>
Ringing or allowing an individual to appear as you or another member of your team in an official match will result in suspension from the league.<br>
<br>
2. Unacceptable Player Names: Player names are NOT to contain words or phrases that pertain to profanity racism religious prejudice sexism or the acceptance of drug use. Failure to request a change to a more agreeable name will result in the removal of the player from the league or a forced name change at the discretion of a league official.<br>
<br>
3. Name Changes: Please notify Warzone officials on the boards of any name changes.<br>
<br>
4. STEAM ID´s: If a player is caught using the incorrect steam id during a match then his score will be wiped on first offense. If a second offense occurs the team will forfiet the match and the player will be suspended.<br>

	<div class="content">As it has been said before, this is only for fun so don't freak out about it too much. The least anyone can do is play on their registered id's and follow the rules. Dallas has been pretty lenient otherwise. The match MfYa played last night was delayed to have Elite get their team ready. Then one of my team had to go so we were the ones short. I talked to Dallas and he allowed a 2v2 if both MfYa and Elite were in agreement to it.<br>
<br>
Yes, holy, dallas should have contacted you and questioned you about the id you were using but you should have at least kept track of it and read the rules... Actually, no. No need to read the rules since its basically the same as in CAL so everyone should know what they are by now.<br>
<br>
Anyway this is still only for the fun of it so shut up and enjoy the damn game already!<br>

<br>
Holy - I have nothing against you or your team. In fact I can bring up all the bullshit logs of your team bad mouthing my team and myself before the match even started, and why? Because grain and billy dont like to play on our server...lol...go back to the first page and look at the pings, billy's ping is better on my server than the ewr server and grain's is only 4 digits worse. So that just goes to show that those guys like to bitch and complain to have their way, when that isn't the case. You all are taking things way out of proportion. If I really wanted everything my way I could suspend your whole team for the acts prior to the match.<br>
<br>
Para - It clearly says in the rules no ringers. Darkology, aka strange who happend to be in 911 was kicked from both teams fair and square. I'm sorry he happend to be your best player and you lost all hope in having a winning shot. Same thing would have happend in CAL and you should know that being a cal admin  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"> <br>
<br>
Just like all the leagues or tournaments I have created they have all been in fun, not for 911 to win as some people say. (BTW I didn't run ILDM Blas), 911 only won ECW because no skilled teams registered. And don't get me wrong I sent invites to all teams. As for the comment about that there is no support on that claim. Because 911 has won 1 league in which I ran. So its a stupid and pointless argument to make. Like chemical said, of course I want to win, I don't go out of my way to make us win however. All I did was enforce rules as any admin should do. If you think the rule should slide because who the team is thats bullshit.<br>
Thats like saying hey Barry Bonds used sterroids but is ok, he's Barry Bonds.....it doesn't make sense guys.<br>
<br>
As for the rules being updated last night; they were indeed updated due to this incident. Instead of making the rule to where the team who broke the rule would just get a forfeit loss I changed that to a second offense so where it was just the players score getting wiped. Now you guys can go on your way and say oh but you only did that because the margin of difference prior to the erased score was so close that if you did that then you guys would win. However I did that because it still gives the stats needed for playoff implications and helps both teams out with the points scored. <br>
<br>
Say what you want, I did what I did to try and run an organized league in which I have put alot of time, effort, and money into. Thanks to rico and chem for backing up my actions and what took place last night, and sorry to the people who seem to think they have the best skill in a video game so they should run the show.<br>

	<div class="content">This is so funny, last season in cal everyone including ewr bitched about rules being bent during matches. Now Dallas enforces a rule as he should of (he has no idea if it was actually Holymoly or some unrostered player) instead of bending it and you still bitch that is too funny. A rule was broken during the match which blows but it is what it is and this would not have been any different in CAL.<br>
<br>
Also 911 has every right to play their match on a true central server (and it should be enforced in all leagues that servers are central to both coasts), sorry to inform you guys but any server east of the center of the USA (which is pretty much the middle of texas) is not a central server.<br>
<br>
 It amazes me as to how many geographically challenged people believe that Chicago is centrally located, its far from it look at a map people and measure the distance from east to west coast if you cant see it with your own eyes. Don't go claiming that its not fair for Canadians either, the majority of players are in the US and both CAL and Warzone are based in the US so it only makes since that central means central in the US.<br>
<br>
 Forcing west coast players to play on a Chicago server would be no different than forcing a east coast player to play on a server in California, which is why teams who are trying to be fair about things pick Dallas as a server location and not one which favors their team due to proximity.<br>
<br>
 Nutri all the things you described happen to me anytime I (a west coast player) plays on a Chicago server or any other east server (including yours), its ping or routing related. BY looking at the screens everyones ping was better at the 911 server, than it was at the ewr server which further goes to show that Dallas is a more equal place to host matches. The internet is not a perfect system and mostly routing causes issues for certain people sometimes and there is nothing that can be done about that, so as long as a server is central that is the best that can be done to TRY to make it the best playing experience for all involved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
NICELY PLAYED DALLAS, ALMOST ONE OF MY CARDS</div></blockquote>

Actually in a conversation after the match he specifically told me if nutri/pb hadn't acted like dicks he wouldn't have even looked at SteamIDs. There's no "probably" there at all.<br>
<br>
Even with my decent ping on your server, Dallas, I still notice physics lag. As everyone knows, I use grenades a lot, and your server has a pretty noticeable hiccup when I throw/grab grenades using the gravity gun. Anything I do with my gravity seems to sort of have a "hiccup" or .1 second delay. It gets irritating and can affect game play on physics heavy maps.<br>
<br>
I wasn't going to get involved in this stupid drama bullshit but it's come so far I figured I'd give my input. Dallas did demand us to get in his server in 5 minutes or we'd get a forfeit. Nutrigrain and Poorbilly did act like complete dicks in pregame. I played the first half of the match and was replaced by a worse player (holymoly, no offense <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">) and then we lost on a technicality because we tried to give holymoly a chance to play and he accidentally used the wrong steam account. <br>
<br>
I don't care if we lose warzone and I care even less about winning such a worthless league. This community is very small and the roster on warzone is even smaller. Enforcing such strict rules like this only brings about more separation in the community. Everybody knows everybody by now and yet still none of us can get along. The entire purpose of a SteamID matching rule is to ensure that ringers aren't put in the match that aren't in the clan. If holymoly was replaced by seagull and scored 50-0, there would be room to bitch, but as it stands he actually performed worse than the player he replaced and 911 still lost. This is not why the rule exists and you are enforcing an arbitrary technicality and only making yourself look like a dick.<br>

Ping is not the only factor to look at when choosing servers. Choke and loss actually have a greater effect on playability and you could have an artificially low ping while having high loss/choke. Ping in itself means nothing but response time from the server, if those packets are getting lost or if you end up sending less packets your game play will not be as smooth.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is very true, however choke and loss are primarily a client caused issue especially loss. Loss is mostly caused by routers across the internet dropping your packets enroute to the server, choke is mostly caused by your cl_updaterate and cl_cmdrate exceeding your bandwith capabilities. So again the most fair thing to do is to have a TRUE central server and everybodies internet connection and cfg are hopefully optimized the best they can be, but that optimization is not the responsibility of the person hosting the game.<br>
 I don't know if you have ever looked at a servers resource meter running a 3v3, but trust me the resources it uses are very slim. Most modern servers can easily run 10 -15 instances of hl2dm without even hitting the 20 percent mark.<br>
I am constantly in servers where people are crying lagg, choke loss ect and yet its perfect for me, so its usually a client problem and not a server problem.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You're absolutely right but I would still prefer a server where I can use cl_updaterate "66", cl_cmdrate "66", and rate 30000 as to get the most amount of data being transferred with no choke/loss. This will without a doubt be an advantage over someone who is forced to use 20 20 10000 just to achieve 0 loss and 0 choke. More data transferred = more accuracy when it comes to client/server interaction. Putting settings at 66, 66, and 30000 with most servers having ticks of 66 is as accurate as it gets (except for LAN of course).<br>
<br>
This is of course my understanding of networking if I'm wrong on anything feel free to correct.<br>
<br>
Now given the size of the United States (and the guys up North) I don't think it's feasible to expect everybody to be able to use these settings. Compromises will always be made but that's beside the point. I don't think Dallas's server is up to par, whatever the true issue may be, with many of the other servers we have available.<br>
<br>
Also how is Texas "true" central? Chicago may be a bit east of the east/west central line, but Texas is definitely South of the North/South central line. Wouldn't true central be Kansas or Nebraska or something? Pacific players will have a disadvantage on Chicago compared to Texas, but New Yorkers would be disadvantaged on Texas compared to Chicago (simply because it is farther south of the "central" North/South line). Hopefully my geography isn't too off <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>

Para - It clearly says in the rules no ringers. Darkology, aka strange who happend to be in 911 was kicked from both teams fair and square. I'm sorry he happend to be your best player and you lost all hope in having a winning shot. Same thing would have happend in CAL and you should know that being a cal admin  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"> 
</div></blockquote>

I could care less whether we won or lost warzone, it was just for fun and practice for CAL and it doesnt mean shit.  Our team wanted to play in it, until your personal vendetta.  At least in CAL there would have been a better chance at proof of what you are accusing.  <br>
<br>
There is absolutely no proof either way that Strange and Darkology are the same people, only some convo you have distributed around saying its him.  Steam convos can be faked easily with any word processing program.  I could do it in wordpad if I wanted to.  Having the same IP address is not proof.  We have had members of the same family in our clan, a father and son, also we have had college room mates in our clan, again the same IP.  It can happen.<br>
<br>
Second, there is no way for a player to remove himself from a roster, as far as I know only the team leader or you can do that.  Strange has not been listed on your roster on your website for quite some time.  Now Darkology gets removed because you neglected to remove Strange (again there is no proof they are the same person) from your own roster?  BS.<br>
<br>
Whatever, doesnt matter.  I won't support Warzone or any other league you dream up because there are really no checks and balances.  The world according to Dallas, just doesnt cut it.<br>

you were duped or mixing up your players.  vision and darkology are not the same.  one or the other may have been pulling your leg... but they are separate people.<br>
<br>
there is no dispute that darkology aliases.  the only dispute for warzone was... is darkology and strange the same person?  dark says no.  dallas says yes.  and the "proof" from dallas was a logged converstion with a 3rd person who was supposed to be strange under an alias.<br>
<br>
the team decison to pull out of warzone was based on dallas removing darkology from our roster, with no warning, no explanation, and prior to the season beginning.  darkology played in no matches.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is possible, I see now via the consortium that the person who uses the alias darkology the most is from Canada, and is also the former Icon member Lost Cause.<br>

from what i know he was in cyn, sw, 911, and wrw, in some cases he was in multiple clans at the same time all with diff steam accounts, maybe some of the more veteran hl2dm players can enlighten us more with what they know.<br>

Strange wasn’t in warzone for 911. He quti dm, left cal 911 team and warzone before I even joined warzone and I was in the Khaos clan. So what rule did I break? <br>
<br>
Below is a post I made in the Khaos private forums.<br>
<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: who took dark off my team?<br>
|911|Herbalizer: I guess dallas<br>
|911|Herbalizer: he was trying to play for 2 teams<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: what  2 teams<br>
|911|Herbalizer: ours<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: what<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: dark kahos and dark 911?<br>
|911|Herbalizer: its strange<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: what<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: how u figure?<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: same ip?<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: steam id<br>
|911|Herbalizer: yup<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: both?<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: link plz<br>
<br>
<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: how u figure?<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: same ip?<br>
«Khaos» p!ke: steam id<br>
|911|Herbalizer: yup<br>
<br>
Naturally my bro and I'd have the same ip cause we live in the same house and have the same internet/IP provider or something. As far as steam id's go my bro has many, zERO, shox, and an impulse one which I use now for css and other games.<br>
<br>
-------- This is apparenlty the proof dallas has about "me" (shox) talking to him about changing servers, etc. Some interesting stuff in this that I'll point out(in Red) to prove that he wrote this whole shit up. Anyone who has known me for a while will see that dallas made this shit up. And dont try changing the convo dallas, other people got it too.<br>
<br>
|911|-Da1: Sup dude<br>
|911|-Da1: I got some stuff to talk about.<br>
shox-: whats that?<br>
|911|-Da1: are you darkology?<br>
shox-: heh, no why?<br>
|911|-Da1: because i looked you up on consortium and talked to osiris about it<br>
shox-: vision try to tell you this?<br>
shox-: cuz that kids a fucking liar<br>
|911|-Da1: lol dude just tell me the fucking truth<br>
|911|-Da1: either you stay with 911 and quti khaos or stay with them and quti 911 or ill expose you <br>
shox-: ...<br>
shox-: ok ill stick with 911<br>
shox-: meh dont tell him tho<br>
|911|-Da1: why not? if your gonna quti it shouldnt matter<br>
shox-: just cause ill come up with something<br>
|911|-Da1: uh ok, what about your server, dont you run a khaos one?<br>
shox-: ya i do<br>
shox-: ill just change the ip of that from gameservers<br>
|911|-Da1: ok well dont do this shit again cuz ist fucking stupid<br>
|911|-Da1: its*<br>
shox-: you got my word man  <br>
|911|-Da1: ok, well i have to go for a few<br>
shox-: k ill ttyl  <br>
|911|-Da1: yea later<br>
|911|-Da1: proof<br>
<br>
--<br>
shox-:<br>
Notice the -. I asked pike to check all the aliases used by shox and he never used "shox-"<br>
<br>
shox-: whats that?<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#BF0000">I never say whats that. my what is always wahts or I'll just say sup? .</span><br>
<br>
shox-: vision try to tell you this?<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#BF0000">I never call technique vision. I say technique,tek,,assault or exodus.</span><br>
<br>
shox-: cuz that kids a fucking liar<br>

<span style="color:#BF0000">I never say "cuz". its usually cause.</span><br>
<br>
shox-: meh dont tell him tho <br>
<span style="color:#BF0000"><br>
I do say "meh" but I usually write meh then write wahtever I want to say in the next sentence.</span><br>
<br>
shox-: ya i do<br>
<span style="color:#BF0000"><br>
I never say "ya" its alawys "ye" (cause Im cool  )<br>
</span><br>
shox-: ill just change the ip of that from gameservers<br>
<strong class="text-strong"><br>
<span style="color:#BF0000">My server is hosted by fatpipe not gameservers. </span></strong><br>
<br>
shox-: you got my word man  <br>
<br>
<span style="color:#BF0000">I never say "word". And "you got my word" wtf I'd never say something like that.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
Reason why dallas took me off warzone.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://i39.tinypic.com/15oclcp.jpg" class="postlink">http://i39.tinypic.com/15oclcp.jpg</a><br>
 <br>
<br>
Yea my pc sucks so bad I have to play in 640 resolution with an fps enhancer  <br>
<br>
score:<br>
<br>
Khaos - 106<br>
Ridikulus (me) 44-23<br>
vapor 31- 40<br>
voz 30-45<br>
<br>
911 - 99<br>
dallas 37-36<br>
kyle 27-39<br>
herbalizer 17-16<br>
<br>
and this is after I got bored of dm and didnt play for a week and didnt even warm up.<br>
<br>
dallas is scared of losing to khaos. Dont make up shit if your not man enough to lose in your league.<br>

oh yeah, this one snuck in on me whilst posting.<br>
<br>
the rev is not rostered on any of the khaos teams in cal.<br>
<br>
his previous vac ban was not related to hl2dm.  but it's a vac ban nontheless.  as far as i'm concerned, i've enjoyed fragging with the rev and he has redeemed himself in my eyes if not in yours/others.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

A ladder format would be great for hl2dm.   Teams wouldn't play the top teams until they make it to the top of the ladder and top team couldn't challenge brand new teams.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is no playoff and you can't challenge teams under your rank, so if you are number two the only team you can challenge is number 1.  If you are team 20 you can only challenge up teams 10-19</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok well since the Warzone is having the same trouble as CAL had regarding matches getting played (not the fault of its management and this is not a slam on that by any means), some of us have decided that maybe a ladder is the better option for Hl2DM after all.   So we would like to give it a try.  However we will be building our own league rather than go with some one elses system.<br>
<br>
We think a system that rewards teams for playing would be the best option, that way the teams that play advance and the ones that dont, dont advance.  <br>

SND, please add me to steam friends: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991568725/home" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/7656 ... 68725/home</a><br>
I would like your advice on this since you have some experience with it.<br>
<br>
Info and developing details can be found: <a href="http://hl2dmcentral.com/DMCentralforums/index.php?board=12.0" class="postlink">http://hl2dmcentral.com/DMCentralforums ... board=12.0</a><br>

Although, I do have willing help in Synergy, I would prefer the administration of this to be represented by multiple clans.  Right now I need 2 people willing to admin a 1v1 and a 2v2 division (3v3 will be added later) and I would like to have an advisory board to discuss the development and ongoing managment of this league.  I would also prefer that people for these positions have some league experience.<br>
<br>
There is also some discussion of some sort of small ($5 or $10) entry fee per player or team paid to a paypal account with all of the proceeds going into a cash prize distributed equally to members of the winning team via paypal or to the team member(s) that paid for the team as a whole if thats how it went.  If people are generally willing to do this, we can set that up rather easily.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I guess I figured people would read the post above and see the site.<br>
<br>
Started setting up a new ladder (non OGL) because I figured it would be best to have this run by the HL2DM community and not be subject to rules set by people that have set things up for other games and do not understand our game.<br>
<br>
Draft rules are up  <a href="http://hl2dmcentral.com/dmcrules.htm" class="postlink">http://hl2dmcentral.com/dmcrules.htm</a><br>
Sign ups are up<br>
Didnt get into maps because:<br>
<br>
No potential admins have come forward with the exception of Panic for killbox<br>
Not many people have come forward to participate in a community advisory board for the league.   Those that have really havent done much.<br>
Only a few people have registered<br>
<br>
Right now its pretty much forum based with plans for a more sophisticated web site if there is interest.  So far there hasnt been much interest so I havent invested much time in it because its too big of a job for one person.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

To be honest, I think this ^^ reflects the current opinion of the community.  I think most people have lost interest in having a league for HL2DM.  Most people have moved on to L4D, COD, CSS, QL, TF2 and/or they are too busy with RL (school, job, family) to commit to what being in a league takes.  Look at what happened with Warzone, it never even reached the playoffs, hell after what, the 4th or 5th week, no one even played their matches anymore.  <br>
<br>
I really dont think there are enough active people/clans left for a stock league.   In general, competative online gaming is declining in North America and for HL2DM it is dead.  Feel free to prove me wrong (please do), but I think the writing is on the wall.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

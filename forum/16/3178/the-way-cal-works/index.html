<br>
Admin+Community should estabnlish a list of all the CAL-Ready maps.<br>
<br>
Map nomination and then map vote threads should be made on CAL website (anti proxy, verified accounts) <br>
<br>
The people nominate maps and then they vote for top maps.<br>

Since admins are also players from a team that wants to play this league, i don't see how having them to pick maps will lead us to any kind of "fairness"  it doesn't feel even. <br>

another alternative is a board.  take one volunteer from the top 9 or top 7 final positions of the current CAL season.  those people act as a board that determine the CAL maps for the next season and set the weekly map rotation.<br>

neither of the above options will work w/o buy in from the CAL game manager.<br>

I didnt pick any maps.  Was totally out of my hands.  I am scratching my head as to why it ended up with a different set up than the vote.  <br>
I do know though that Milieu was going to be in no matter what.   I dont think this is a bad thing, we need some new maps.  It replaced cannon which I am sure all would agree was a complete clusterfuck as a match map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">What exactly did not go the way you wanted conflict?<br>
<br>
As for voting we did what we thought worked best in the short time we had. If you start limiting the voting to certain people you run into other problems. This season people complained about outside people not playing. So we let outside people vote, and made an open league. If you vote any other way you need a good way to enforce it, and a standard for who can vote. Who can? People who played? how many per team? What determines if you played? Will anything you do make everyone happy?<br>
<br>
The map vote was completely open anyone could nominate any map and people voted and the votes went pretty much as expected so I do not see how it is a large problem. Should we allow people to vote in all maps and not have any maps brought in to keep things fresh? Of course maps are going to be selected that diversify the gameplay after the vote. But do people not have a say? the top 5, more then the 4 promised made it into every division partly because their was a clear vote jump when you came to spot 5 indicating a strong desire for that map. Which only left 3 maps left to be picked. Since valar worked hard and produced a high quality map for competitive play and will probably be around to update it as needed that took the rotational map spot. So that means there were only 2 maps left to pick. Thats not much... But you still get complaints no matter what you do... It is not even possible for their to be bias on 5 of the maps is my point. I think the major dissapointment was many people thought they were going to be able to vote in new maps, sorry your wrong the masses of people are not going to rally behind a new map, look at how much talk their was about several maps from a few players but when it came time to vote the old standards came back and only maps already in CAL made the top 5. And in fact in the top 8 votes no map that was not already in competition made the cut, either past present or europe. Which shows that most people are voting on what they know well not really looking to new maps. <br>
<br>
If admins were not picking new maps and pressing for the improvment of existing maps we would never be playing any of these maps today:<br>
dm_lost arena<br>
dm_caverns_r1<br>
dm_tigcrik_r2<br>
aim_arena_reloaded<br>
dm_lockdown_rX<br>
dm_biohazard_cal<br>
dm_zeta_rc2<br>
dm_amplitude_r1<br>
dm_drift_revised<br>
<br>
Every single one of those maps were helped along by admin and player critique to make them far better then the original map the mapper released. And many of them were new to CAL since I took over as GM and no one would even know about them today they had not been "forced in by EXTREME BIAS". So if you like any of them you should be thinking about that. <br>
<br>
Otherwise our map cycle would probably look more like this:<br>
<br>
dm_lockdown<br>
dm_lostvillage<br>
dm_frenzy<br>
dm_overwatch<br>
dm_powerhouse<br>
dm_underpass<br>
dm_swamplight_final<br>

	<div class="content">Everyone is good at lockdown , in the past I have wanted to change it but the conservative move has been to keep it the same. This season I actually do hope to change the finals map since several mappers have really done a great job improving maps for competitive play. <br>
<br>
It is the best map of many clans, and one of the few maps out there that any other clan has beat $W on, if I was bias I would pick some random new map and use that as the finals map or one we really have never lost on. <br>
<br>
<br>
How can I strategically place maps when I have no idea whom my team will play in the season, last season it was your clan leader scheduling not me. My team probably has the worst luck of any team out there when it comes to weeks we have to play clans. last season we played your team in caverns your best map and I am accused of being bias by you, isn't that ironic. The only strategy to maps being placed in the season is to spread them out IE if its in preseason it wont be in the first week of play. Or if its the first finals map it will not be the last week of play. And if I know a map may get altered during the season I may push it to the end of the season to give the mapper some time. I also try to keep maps that play across multiple leagues on the same week so people do not need to practice 3 different maps that week.  You will notice amplitude is up for editing and is the last week of play, lockdown may need another edit and so is tested in the preseason and moved to the end of the season in case something needs to be changed. Zeta is also a possible edit. Milieu was in preseason and so cant be at the start. Believe it or not there is actually some thought put into the placement of the maps but it has nothing to do with my team winning.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nino's out of the picture this season, so drop it already.  Nino with a band of retarded chimpanzees telling him what keys to press on his keyboard couldn't fuck up last CAL season as badly as you did by listening to Seagull's crybaby ass.<br>
Seriously, there's alot of talk going around amongst clans about boycotting CAL until you give up the GM spot or get your shit together.  Your own admins are disgruntled or quitting.  Or would that suit you just fine?  You can steamroll the CSS teams straight through to another unblemished season without anyone questioning what you're doing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Fearsome is correct in that if maps were always 100% player selected, a good half of the current most popular competitive maps would be pretty much completely unknown and not used, and we would still be stuck using trash like 7hour and frenzy.<br>
<br>
That said, 2/8 admin-chosen or new maps per season is plenty, especially considering how many of them fail (the majority, according to past seasons). It also feels pointless to have a top8 vote then only use the top4... just have a top4 next time or how ever many vote slots are actually going to be used once the poll ends.<br>
<br>
Lastly, map dates have always been chosen strategically (staggered as one aim / movement oriented map, one control / spam map etc) or to sync with other divisions. Not that i can see if thats the case this season, as the unnecessary google sidebar "upgrade" wont load with high security settings, something im not about to change considering how often the cal site gets hacked.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im not even sure why those top 5 maps you listed were even in the map vote. Everyone is well aware that those 5 were gonna be in the CAL rotation. The map vote shouldnt of had those CAL maps and players should of voted for alternative maps for the last spots. Instead, many voted for the CAL maps because they wanted to make sure they were in, when they already would of been in regardless, leaving the new nominations in the dust. I suggest leaving out the maps that everyone is well aware of being the best, and concentrate on maps that many players arent that aware of. There are so many maps out there that are more worthy then those top 5 that no one plays. Sure, they may need updates, but all those CAL proven maps have been updated too. It would also force players to maybe spend some time actually looking over and testing other maps on a server, instead of only playing 5 maps in their dm lifetime.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm not about to call people out.  If they wanna step up they can, but I can tell you for certain that ewR isn't the only clan that feels that way.<br>
If the death of this game hinges on Fearsome being GM then it definitely needs to die.  That ranks up there with some of the most retarded comments I've heard on this forum Zman.  Congrats.<br>
I really don't give a flying fuck who runs the league, but system needs to be in place that can minimize any accusations of bias.  The people in charge need to be accountable to the people playing.  That way if someone does exhibit bias tendencies then the league players have the right to kick them to the curb.  <br>
And then what?  I dunno, Paradox can run things just fine, KO could step back in, there are plenty of other capable people, I really don't care as long as it's someone who is willing to listen to reason and not half-ass things.  Take the new divisions for example.  Great.  Open and Main.  The people got what they wanted right?  No, Main is flooded with inactive and CSS teams and no one is stepping up to fix it.<br>
It's that kind of thinking that shows poor management.  "I'll give them what they want, half-ass do what they want, then say 'I told you so' when it doesn't work." If you're going to listen to people and try to work on things, then truly listen, and follow through completely.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sacrifist, I think you may have missed the point of the vote in the first place.  People kept saying the choice of maps in the map rotation was biased.  I pushed for the vote so that we could show that the map choice was unbiased as well as to see if there were maps people wanted to see out of the rotation.  If you recall, we first had a nomination thread with a deadline.  Then we took all of the maps that people nominated within the guidelines stated (which division they were being suggested for).  Polls were constructed out of the lists of what maps were nominated for what divisions.<br>
<br>
Yes anyone could predict that the old favorites would be voted in, but in part that is what we meant to prove.  I will say though that IMO, people should have been allowed to vote for 8 maps, not 4.  I think it would have showed what people wanted BESIDES the old favs mentioned and might have gotten a couple of different maps in the mix.<br>
<br>
Again IMO, I think Icepick should be in and Swamplight out.  I had the opportunity to do this earlier but I thought it was going to be that way anyway so I didnt state it outright.  I apologize to everyone for that, but again IMO its still early and its not too late to exchange Icepick for Swamplight now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Swamplight was picked over ice pick cause we played ice pick in a previous season and the combines ablity to control both the rocket and the charger turned it into even a bigger spawn fest then swamplight. Other then that they are made by the same mapper and have the same style through most of them so it really does not matter much to me. Do I have any bias no, why would I even care which one? I only look analytically at them and try to pick the better of the 2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Fearsome has had his ups and downs, overall it's been OK. IMO some of the things done were unforgivable and questionable, banning of Ace was heavyhanded, as much as the community did hate him, choice of maps in most of early CAL season finals and the most recent of using Zman like a puppet to create a shadow map selection thread that nullified the vote of the blatently larger more well known map selection thread which was slimy as all hell. I'm in politics on campus, people at least get paid to come up with slimy ways to gain the upperhand. However lately the things you say are correct, and I think you have learned some lessons from the heat of recent events brought on you. I think you can do a good job this season and fully expect it. The childishness is getting tiresome, then again most of the people that play here are under 18 and can't see it. The older you get the more absolutely tiring and retarded acting like a moron to get attention becomes. If he should abuse power this season, bring on the heat in an organized, calculated manner, the CAL admins above him would sympathize with that approach instead of acting like a bunch of foaming monkeys, only making the admins above him more sympathetic to his cause.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Seriously, after holding up last season for a month to investigate some bullshit claims of hacking you're going to say that we're crying wolf? Wow.  <br>
You still put in maps you wanted.  You still put them in the order you wanted.  You still ignore the advice and questions of the admins under you and have set up another season of fail.  The whole divisions issue is one of my biggest gripes.  You made divisions like people asked, then didn't bother with cleaning them out, or locking the Main or making any actual separation there.  Then when things go to shit, you can claim that it's our fault, you should've never listened to us, and throw out the gigantic "I told you so" card.  It's this kind of arrogance and unwillingness to listen to what the players and admins are actually saying that's truly detrimental to the league.<br>
All I've done is point these kinds of things out.  The people here can make up their own minds.  You may or may not be biased, but the league is set up in such a fashion where a bias GM could get away with alot all the while staying within the rules.

We made complaints about you last season for your shenanigans.  No secret there.  Did it do anyone anygood?  Nope.  That's why I don't mind calling you out here in front of the people that actually give a fuck about HL2DM.  CAL directors don't really seem to.

Probably not.  Back in the 80's you had guys like Hulk Hogan, the Macho Man Randy Savage and the Ultimate Warrior.  Those guys were awesome, but in the very early 80's wrestling wasn't the big business it is today.  People would come out to see larger than life 'roid monsters toss each other around, but it didn't have the following that it developed later on.  But later promoters learned how to really get people involved.  They brought in people like the Iron Sheik, and the Koloff's, figures that defined what everyone hated at the time.  There was the conflict with Iran, and the cold war was still big news, and these characters epitomized what the American public despised, and this conflict that everyone knew about from the news was playing out on there televisions now, right in front of them, but without any real worry.  Bingo!  Pro-Wrestling organizations were now as American as apple pie, generating millions, drawing people by the thousands and selling pay-per-view events like candy.<br>
You still think that we actually want to tear the community apart, but if you'll talk to the people who really know us, you'll find that that's not true.  It's an inside joke with us since we're accused of it all the time, but if we wanted to tear things down, we'd be going about it a different way.  Yes, ewR is the antihero team.  We're assholes from time to time and most people don't get the joke, but we're not what you keep trying to portray us as, and alot of players understand that now.  Poor Billy is The Rock, btw.  He called it.<br>
People love controversy.  When I first started lurking these forums they were dead, and CAL was on the verge of being roadkill.  The playoffs of EE's first CAL season were held up for over 2 months while VDuS and $W were off playing TF2. Now, there's people on this forum all the time,  IRC usually has at least a few people talking, and CAL is both forming new teams and resurrecting old ones.  I'm not saying ewR is the only thing helping, I'm not that conceited by any means, but I am saying that a sunshine, lollipop and rainbow organization is boring, and that people want to see a good fight - especially if it's gets ugly.<br>
I like the whole adult vs. children lecture you brought in here, and I will say that prank calls could be viewed as a bit childish, but our team really doesn't have a leader so to speak, and I'm damn sure not going to try to tell my team what they can or can't do.  However, I will do this: To Luke: ewR apologizes giving you are hard time in the past.  You took a bat to the knees with the whole Kigha thing, and lately we've found you to be a decent person.  So if the prank call caused any trauma to you or your family, we're sorry.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Draft night - tried hard but died.  <br>
Map contest - has its own level of controversy to keep it interesting.  <br>
Board members post at CU - 2 points for that one.<br>
People promoting - I'll give you a bit of credit for that one too, but the whole "gg | hl2dm-university.com" actually seems to offend alot of the pub players I've talked to.  Some don't understand that it's an actual site, they think it's a site for hax or another way of saying they've been schooled.  People who've actually taken the time to give a bit of explanation about site have brought people in though.<br>
 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/thumb.gif" width="25" height="18" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up"> <br>
BTW, I wouldn't have known of the impulse exploit if it wasn't for Grape.  Explained all the extra smg nades and armor I kept finding in those pub servers.<br>
<br>
EDIT: PB reminded me that draft was organized by....oh wait, who?...ewR|ninojman...and let's see, who provided the vent server for it?  Oh, ewR|sisterFister.  So, ya, +2 for us.<br>
Also, 4 ewR players are map contest judges.  So, +2 more. <br>

WT and Keeper keep this site running.  <br>

There are other members of the board that have contributed.  <br>

Valar helps people with mapping questions.<br>
<br>
The instructors teach people when they ask.<br>
<br>
Training server = Khaos<br>
I and others are involved in the map contest, not just ewr.<br>
<br>
When I first came here I too saw it was kinda dead so I started posting every day.  Whether it was just saying hi to new people or input to other threads, I made the effort and that helped to liven things up.  Several of us did that.  I aso promoted draft night on my forums and through steam which got people to play in it.<br>
<br>
Khaos has promoted this site on our pub for over a year.  Besides many that have come because of that, I have had at least past and current 8 clan members join the DMU because of my involvement here.  Most of them have stopped participating because of the continual flame wars and BS that infects this place now.  They see nothing else of value here.<br>
<br>
Again the point is that without the efforts of many, this site would not still be here.  No one group or person can take full credit.<br>
<br>
I also think think that in this case, how you relate to others on a day to day basis can have a large effect on how you are viewed.  <br>
<br>
This is just an observation and not a judgement: Yes you may be involved but for some reason people seem to judge you more by your actions that are much more visible than your name on a list as map judge.  You guys often come off as looking like assholes by the way you interact here at times. <br>
<br>
Also as a point of getting the facts straight, as I recall  Sister was Redlight when he arranged for the vent server. I forget the name of the team/group the vent belonged to but it was a group he and Modus were members of (Voxtex too I believe?).   Also EWR didn't exist nor was WRW resurrected in DM when Nino organized the first draft night.  EWR and EE had nothing to do with either of those specifically as EWR, those two people became EWR after the fact.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Or you can always call someone an idiot and run away.<br>
Google the word "sarcasm".<br>
I never said ewR was the sole reason IRC or this forum is busy.  Do I need to quote myself?  K.  <br>
Serious Rico posted:
<blockquote><div><cite>Uncle Rico wrote:</cite>People love controversy.  When I first started lurking these forums they were dead, and CAL was on the verge of being roadkill.  The playoffs of EE's first CAL season were held up for over 2 months while VDuS and $W were off playing TF2. Now, there's people on this forum all the time,  IRC usually has at least a few people talking, and CAL is both forming new teams and resurrecting old ones.  I'm not saying ewR is the only thing helping, I'm not that conceited by any means, but I am saying that a sunshine, lollipop and rainbow organization is boring, and that people want to see a good fight - especially if it's gets ugly.</div></blockquote>
OK, hopefully you read that part carefully, because then, Sarcastic Rico posted:
<blockquote><div><cite>Uncle Rico wrote:</cite>
Draft night - tried hard but died.  <br>
Map contest - has its own level of controversy to keep it interesting.  <br>
Board members post at CU - 2 points for that one.<br>
People promoting - I'll give you a bit of credit for that one too, but the whole "gg | hl2dm-university.com" actually seems to offend alot of the pub players I've talked to.  Some don't understand that it's an actual site, they think it's a site for hax or another way of saying they've been schooled.  People who've actually taken the time to give a bit of explanation about site have brought people in though.<br>
 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/thumb.gif" width="25" height="18" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up"> <br>
BTW, I wouldn't have known of the impulse exploit if it wasn't for Grape.  Explained all the extra smg nades and armor I kept finding in those pub servers.<br>
<br>
EDIT: PB reminded me that draft was organized by....oh wait, who?...ewR|ninojman...and let's see, who provided the vent server for it?  Oh, ewR|sisterFister.  So, ya, +2 for us.<br>
Also, 4 ewR players are map contest judges.  So, +2 more. <br>

See how I introduced a points system there?  That's pure lulz.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  After that, Very Sarcastic Rico posted:

I am not sure where it was said that a bunch of "nobodies" wouldn't beat $W.   The closest post I can find to that was one by Valiums: "And it's safe to say that if Helk plays for $W with Seagull, Luke and TLC, that nobody will even come within 50 points of a win against $W, you can mark my words on that if they have that lineup playing" in this thread: <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1869&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;start=60" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... a&amp;start=60</a>.<br>
<br>
In any case, if some one did actually say it, they were an douche for doing so because no one on your team, nor the clans it arose from were unknown at the time.<br>
<br>
Very few people in this game truely know each other, but people do make judgements on what they see.    I dont know you and I dont pretend to, I can only go on the evidence you provide.  People can't turn off who they are with a switch, and how you act online can give a very good indication of the person you are.  Your statement: "I can be one of the biggest assholes online" is the perfect example.  If that is all that people see then that is what they will believe.  Its up to you to show differently IF you want to.  If you dont then you shouldnt be surprised that people think the way they do and nothing short of changing what people see will change their minds.  <br>
<br>
I will also say that there are people in EE/EWR that I dont have any issues with either.  Chemicalburn, Josey, GhostDog and Sgt. Pepper are all good guys.  I generally dont have an issue with Rico.  Other than the whole CAL debacle, I think Nino is a good guy as well.  As for the rest, there are times that I do believe you are assholes in general, based on what I have seen.  I dont believe in making a judgement about an entire group based on the actions of one or a few individuals, but instead consider each individual for his or her own merits and the evidence they show me in their attitudes and behavior.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">that must be where i part ways with other people.<br>
<br>
i'm not hating at all.  but i am wanting to discuss.  and this is my general opinion towards all those "villian" wannabees out there.<br>
<br>
i take issue with racial slurs.  and i let people know i take issue.  if they continue, i leave/mute/ignore/etc.  how is that hating?  i shouldn't give a fuck about racial slurs?<br>
<br>
i take issue with lies and deception.  especially if the motivation is to intentionally humiliate or demean other players in this community.  you got a personal beef with a single player?  take it up with them.  subjecting other people to your vendetta is not going to earn any respect.  you don't want to earn respect?  thats your choice.  don't be all butthurt when respect isn't shown.<br>
<br>
i take issue with internet gaming rivalries crossing over into real life.  that's just completely fucked up.  anyone else finding such outrageous behavior worth a hardy har har is also messed up.  any team/clan that would condone such behavior w/o giving that member the boot has some flaws to work out.<br>
<br>
i suppose ignoring the beast is part of the choice.  but not the only choice.  i am not the type to go gentle into that good night.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

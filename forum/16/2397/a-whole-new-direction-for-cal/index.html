No idea how you would even determine match ups with this.  Also determining seed would be one hell of  a lot of work for the admin.  The CAL sytem has no way of reporting such a thing in terms of which players are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc in a match or round.  Also how you do would greatly depend on who else is in the match so there would be a huge randomess to it.   In short its not really possible to run a statistically sound FFA league.  It would be just like playing in a FFA pub.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The misconception that there is no Killbox League because there are no people who are willing to admin it should stop. It is preposterous, and relies on an occurrence, maybe two. .<br>
I’ll try to explain myself without sounding personal because I’m not. I see this as a phenomenon. Not a conspiracy.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> <br>
<br>
Killbox players shun CAL’s society. Period. They don’t like it because it doesn’t like them. People who advance in movement enter a society that not only looks at other game styles as inferior to theirs but also names itself a “Leet” society. ..of “leet” players. An Elite. Better than others. I’m not saying there are evil people here on in CAL but unavoidably, people get easily sucked into this feeling of being better than others. Even if they don’t have anything against killbox and even regular killbox servers (wink wink) they still love it and prefer not to argue about it. Not really. Even if they don’t personally think they’re better than other for the most part people avoid conflict and don’t stand up to what they believe. Standing up for what you believe means more than words in forums or voting in forum polls. It means sometimes risking losing someone’s approval. This is human and even loveble but still, resulting from that is that things stay as they are as long as those in power remain in their own mindset and others leave it alone.<br>
<br>
No admin here on in CAL will openly say “Killbox is inferior – we are the shit” but that doesn’t mean this way of thinking doesn’t exist. It does. And it’s well known.<br>
<br>
Good people, real talented people, not by any means bad guys find themselves entering a society which more than anything resembles a College Frat. I mean this lovingly and not with scorn. But with criticism.<br>
This is human nature and is not an evil thing. But if one wants to know why there is no KB league in CAL, or a KB (or CO-OP, or CTF or wth ever) section on this forum they should understand that unspoken “code” that is part of HL2DM CAL society's mindset (or L33ts as it were) does not allow it. Many won't like hearing this because it says something about them. but where you're done flamming ..after a while, you'll move on to another thread and it will still be true.<br>
<br>
There are great many Low-G clans out there who don’t need to defend their performance as admins or abilities as adults in that respect.<br>
There are killbox leagues out there also. One..maybe two. .<br>

I would personally never stand in the way of a KB league, but I wont admin one either as my hands are already full with what I am doing.  In the KB community, like in the classical style map community there are differences of opinion regarding what is considered a good map and what is not.  I personally would like to see a KB league get started because I do think there could be enough people willing to play it to make at least a 1v1 kb league work.  Would I be one of those people, probably not.  I also think that there is enough variety of maps (thanks in large part to you) that we could find enough maps of sufficient design variety to make a league interesting every week and not the same old classic kb map that we have seen change only in color or a few props here and there but basically remained the same in overall design.    I have not seen anyone step forward yet and say "I will be willing to admin such a league"  Correct me if I am wrong, you didnt apply did you?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You could not be more wrong on this point. The reason no Killbox, ctf, or co-op section exists<br>
in these forums is because I wanted to unify the community and not segregate it. I worded our site philosophy very carefully to ensure it encompassed this basic principle:<br>
<br>
"HL2DMU is designed for all players with a good attitude, regardless of clan affiliation, skill level, play-style preference, and reputation."<br>
<br>
I don't know how many times I have to reiterate this. I am also a killbox player and supporter. Go ask KBH how long I have been fragging with them. Ask yourself why I have been trying to get a killbox map pack finished for the site (the site Official working on it is MIA unfortunately, so it never got completed). Ask yourself why I have invited killbox players here to the site, and why I have killbox players as Officials also. I may not be a "killbox only" player, but to imply that there is an unspoken "code" in place here at DMU is simply ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I will say it yet again: All hl2dm players are welcome here. We endorse freedom of speech so expect opinions contrary to your own, plus do not take them to be the opinion of the site. If you want to know where DMU stands on an issue, read our mission, objectives and philosophy please...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">personally i dont think valar's post could have been more accurate. he is absolutely right.  from my stand point most ppl that are avid CAL players, and by coincidence or not, are the ones that post here, look down on KB maps.  but, with that being said, everybody has their own likes and dislikes as far as maps and playing styles go.  i personally enjoy playing on EYE servers and listening to music while i play.  i dont see how a KB section of CAL would be any different to govern then the normal section.  I told Para. b4 i believe CAL should have many divisions for HL2dm. BUT, she is right in saying those low grav players need to step up and be willing to admin them.  <br>
<br>
I think the big reason most CAL players dont like KB/low grav maps is because it tends to take the movement part of the game out. you really cant bhop in low or semi low grav servers.  also the strategy is totally different.  BUT that still doesnt mean that that style shouldnt have a place in CAL.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">from a perspective from someone who used to only play killboxes adn logged many many hours on teh kbh/tsgk servers and then was encouraged to play in CAL and having 2 less than stellar seaons @ <br>
1v1 <br>
1 real win vs a cs player who quti after losing first round.<br>
3 ffw yay more cs playrs.<br>
5 or 6 pummellings. i still had fun.<br>
<br>
and my first 4v4(wRw2 frankenstien team) here is my thoughts.<br>
<br>
i agree there is an underlying attitude of players (in CAL or just in other servers) who dismiss the kill box as an aim only style of play, that is somehow inferior b/c there is less strategy and movement skill required. <br>
<br>
i've learned that to try to convince people that they're wrong is maybe the most difficult thing in this life to do. or maybe not even wrong, but that there are people who see things different then they do.<br>
<br>
people hold on to their convictions like pinless grenades. <br>
i say let go and jihad the fuck out of us all  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil">  <br>
i encourage people to have a little fun once in a while, play 1v1's or team matches to test your limits. <br>
allowing your opinions of what anyone else is doing can make you lose focuse on your own game.<br>
finding that thing about this game that makes YOU happy is all that is really important.<br>
<br>
on a semi-related note.<br>
for us players who are semi sucky, want to play for only fun, and get contiuously stompped by other top teir playrs (cough pb) but still enjoy competing, but maybe want to compete without recieving a total asswhooping, can we get a scrub leauge going? <br>
<br>
maybe that's a name that won't endear itself to people of medium skill level to play.....<br>
but as is the aim of this site, i'd like to get a wider playing pool with lower level players, than an exclusive club of shrinking player pool.<br>
tell me if i'm way off base like lou broc on acid...<br>
would more people come to play if the competition was more varied? am i shamelessly trying to get a real win in cal??<br>
i'll leave you with a final thought b/c the sleeplessness and the double espresso are at war in my head right now and i feel like i'm rambling...<br>
did you have more fun winning a round 68-1 or 18 to 16?<br>
are their even enough players to have a CS like CAL-M and CAL-O levels? i think not.<br>
and that's what i'd like to focus on. the decline in participation, and what can be done to get more people to compete at different skill levels.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
this is true but there is some irony in that statement.  we all keep saying, "oh this is a dying game, nobody wants to join".  we have nobody to blame for this but ourselves.  there are really 2 places you can play if you are a noob coming into this game.  1) locked private scrim servers, which they cant get into cause they dont know the server owners, 2) pubs, in which ppl from here go to ridicule them and poke fun, then post that here.  the second option can be broken down into low and high grav, and KB's  which again, as discussed ppl look down on.  SOOO, my point is, the game is dying because we keep closing the doors to expansion.  if i was just starting this game and heard of this site, came to it, read the discussions, I wouldnt come back to it.  we all tolerate it because we have all become a second family to each other, but noobs that dont understand any of this will never get it if we dont welcome them.  i think we need to ask ourselves, do we really want this game to grow, or are we just going to continue to keep those doors closed and bitch because nobody is coming in.  expansion will never happen if we dont try, maybe a KB league wont work, maybe a B division wont work.  we will never know until we try.  a B division would be the best possible way i can think of to get new teams into CAL, and young teams into learning the team work style that you must have to succeed in CAL.  Think of it as the "minors" in pro sports.  draft picks dont go right to the big league(save a few) they go to the minors first and learn the pro style of the game.  i would also hope that the B division wouldnt get filled with aliased A dvision players just so they can pwn and laugh about it, we will have to have some sort of ip address log to match against the A, so if you participate in the A you cant play in the B and vice versa.  Im fucking sick and tired of hearing ppl bitch that this game is dying.  myself and a few others HAVE stepped up to the plate to start these new divisions, and as far as im concerned, have been ignored.<br>

	<div class="content">I have thought a B division is needed for a long time, we always have a bunch of people sign up for 1v1 only to drop after one or two times of getting completely destroyed. The thought that there won't be enough people in the past may have been true but I think that even if it starts off slowly and has only 10 or so people playing in it would be fine. The following season word will spread from those who played in it and had fun this time. Admins will just need to keep an eye on whos playing and what the scores are, if we see someone who is winning by very large margins each time then they may just need to be moved up to A division in order to not defeat what we are trying to accomplish. <br>
<br>
I also want to say that when I first started playing this game 3 or so years ago, there was quite a bit of noob bashing however today I really don't see it anymore to that extent. I make my way around alot of servers and I think the attitudes of most players is pretty good, so I dont think some of the posts here are exactly on target.<br>
 There are a number of servers that cater to newer players and they tend to be full, while the pro servers tend to be empty so by doing this B divison if we can get those play for fun type players into it, they might be able to advance their skills and move up to a higher level and that would be great for the game. If everyone could keep this in mind and help nurture some of these players I think it would be great. <br>
<br>
Lastly there has been some growth in the game over the last year, its just been small and hard to notice. If you really think about it though there has been some good players who have made their way into cal and the upper circles of players that were not here the year before, so don't think the game is dead yet, it's just getting older and has a lot of competition from new games.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

True. And to Valar there are douche bags everywhere. Or 'L33ts' as you call them. some claim stock is the only way to play some claim low grav kb is.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Fearsome* wrote:</cite> The real issue I see is  just a map. Why does everyone think that starting a killbox league will have some sort of positive effect. </div></blockquote>
Because 35% of the community plays Killbox. I'd say 75% of the current Stock players started in Killbox and just moved there way over to stock.  Making a killbox league would only speed this.<br>

Some use jump pads which Stock maps have yet to use at all.  Jokes when you have plenty of people seriously willing to lend help and put in work to make it happen.  The more admins we have the better. Valar put in work to get interest and you let it dry up.  He is obviously still willing to get it to happen.<br>

<br>
That being said 2v2 killbox was tried in CU and worked for a season. Yet to be seen if they will do it again. But it was worth a try.<blockquote><div><cite>Super Luigi wrote:</cite>real reason nothing new happens or changes: this game is not growing, there are and never will be any new players who have the will to deal with this community to become true compettitors. you can say what you want but this community hasn't had any growth for a long long while and I think we all know the reason for that.</div></blockquote>


<blockquote><div><cite>Fearsome* wrote:</cite>I am all about diverse game styles in CAL.</div></blockquote>
Then you should try to get the other 55% of the very active community in shell shock.  They have a play made league which is shitty, and would jump on CAL.  Shellshock is growing and growing fast. New players can jump in and own.  Something that hl2dm has always lacked.  Pubs are full 24/7 and doubling each day.  Clans are starting everywhere.<br>
<br>
<br>
So if Hl2dm really wants new players in League play. League play will need to be expanded.<br>
 1v1 must be open to new players all season long.<br>
It was easy for me to get quake and UT players to jump into cal-1v1 but since the rosters close because of ko it will not expand.  give ko the top division and get more admins.<br>
<br>
1v1,2v2,4v4 needs a lower division and admins that are willing to go get new players and teams, and then stay on them and make sure they play. Cal admins say they thought about it and thought it wouldn't work....  Any hl2dm League that tried a upper and lower division got more teams then cal has ever had; Ildm and CU so when it was tried it worked and worked out well.<br>
<br>
SS is the biggest form of hl2dm atm and there will be leagues popping up for it all over Cal should get out in front so the players get more exposure to the game in general.<br>
<br>
KB also has a lot of people willing to admin a league, let them do it.<br>
<br>
Let the league run on there own. Don't make them run all at the same time. They are all different.  Should be different times. IE CU<br>
<br>
Most important like any league keep the dead time to a minimum which has been the worst thing for league play in Cal, well for hl2dm. No other league has dead time like cal-hl2dm has had.  I can only think of one reason.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

SW, 911, flas, ewr.  etc.  when these less experienced teams are scheduled to play vs these top teams they know they are just going to get their asses handed to them so why even bother playing.  yes experience against talented experienced teams is good but nobody likes to get their asses kicked all over the map, just not fun.  with a B division these less experienced teams will get that time to grow as a team, and learn that important team style play.  this can only HELP cal as a whole.

Like 15 admins have applied to help 5 of which would be good for helpers.  3 Others have offered to start Killbox.  SS has the person who created the plug-in and user-made league, plus the various other players who are very active. Many of which have 100+ hours of hl2dm game play. None have been looked into. But rest assured that Fearsome thought about it and then thought it wasn't a good idea.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Like 15 admins have applied to help 5 of which would be good for helpers.  3 Others have offered to start Killbox.

	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Val asked me to read this thread and he bugged me until I did, then put a bug in my ear about the whole issue. <br>
<br>
This is Psychopomp, I applied to become cal staff now maybe 2 months back? Part of my wish was to run the low grav/killbox league, the community group was once ran by Val and has now passed it on to me. Everyone knows that no one more than  me would like to see some serious changes, not only to cal but the whole "L33T" society. It has always been my position that a REALLY good player should be able to play a good game, in ANY gravity, in ANY mod [shulshok,shelshock,pro] to think that this game is only played ONE way is a diservice to the community at large.<br>
<br>
If you dislike different styles, that is different, but if you love the game as I do, and you would like to see it grow, having wider acceptance will only mke it better for everyone, including making the "L33T" style more prominent, more popular, etc.<br>
<br>
At one point I consider starting forums with the name HL2DM Community College "For the rest of us". We can't all afford or want to go "l33t" but that doesn't mean we are of no benefit to the community at large. I spend a lot of time going back and forth in all levels of grav from 100 [MaX clan] to 600 [Team Veracity] and in between [MF clan] I have worked hard on getting to know a little bit about it all, I was admin at Skulshock for a while and although it is not for me most of the time, I became very good friends with very good people and some seriously good players. I believe I am more than qualified, in time and knowledge to be a cal admin for this style, however is my dislike of getting trampled by T.U.A [the usual a-holes] that prevents me from visiting the IRC channel [Directed to Fearsome in his comment come here and talk to me] No one ever contacted me from cal, after applying to the website. After OCT 1st, I will be available again as I use to be having finalized my move to Colorado [LOOONG move I know, but worked for the best] <br>
<br>
I may not be the most popular person because of my outspoken nature and what not but no one can deny that I could be a successful admin, so please consider it based on qualifications and not personal choices. <br>

If an A player wants to beat on lesser skilled players, they can do that in the pubs, like they already do.<br>

A low grav/high velocity division would make me happy too, we would have to select a standard on what gravity and what velocity would sort of fall in the middle of the ones used out there.  Same would have to be for the killbox division, what killboxes are most favored, at what grav, etc. <br>

In that division you would not need an A and B team, so that would simplify the enrollment.<br>

Steam is a terrible platform this may not matter to you but IRC channels and their non intrusive design is why the leagues of nearly EVERY game use it and not steam.

If you can't be bothered to figure IRC out then why would I think you are going to go through all the hard work of learning how to admin a league?

As for admins yep we are looking and yes I started talks about a killbox league and people are always welcome to discuss it. And just to set the record strait. There are exactly 11 denied applications (mostly people I have never even heard of many don't even appear to play the game) 10 accepted applications roughly half of which have gone inactive and 3 undecided. Even so we try hard to pick admins and its not easy, I think I have done a decent job with my judgment though only failed twice one quti less then a month into the job lol. <br>
<br>
As for nino, if the killbox was an attempt to make it fail please explain how. We pissed off more of the competitive players doing it then anything else. Even other admins were against it. We busted out and made a whole map for it the entire plan was to help unify both communities. It just did not work but the players who compete played them even though they did not like them, the people who we took all the risk for barely showed up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The competitive community can grow even if the game does not as noobs become better and are trained into competition. This is very possible and normal for a game. In fact in the late days of HLDM I would say it was really their hay day for competition almost everyone who played was competing in leagues and many attended LANs.

IRC was made for people running 56k's so it uses the least amount of bandwidth.  <br>
MIRC is easy, fearsome's way is very easy,  Steam, MSN, X-fire anything you can think of you have to add friends and can't see everyone.  IRC anyone can join the room.  And 70% of the players that are gonna join hl2dm at this point Know how to use IRC better then 60% of the HL2dm community.<br>
<br>
Fearsome all cal did was add one killbox map to 1v1.  That isn't gonna get any hardcore killbox play to join.<br>
<br>
2v2 Killbox league worked in Clans United. For a season, Lack of admin updates killed it. <br>
<br>
Also CU has a rule (idk If it is a write rule or not) that they only have 8 teams per division.  If teams drop it's not that big of a deal other leagues in cal have had 6 or 4 teams in invite.  Cal-p or Cevo-p teams play twice a season, Much like NFL.  <br>
<br>
Everyone else stop saying B division Lmao you sound so noob.  Just look at any other league in cal if you are wondering how Cal-o/im/m/I/p work.<br>
<br>
Again like with other leagues in cal, if one team is good or deserves to be inthe higher division the admins can just place them there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

it wouldn't be a 'b' division the teams that played in the top 10 would move up to Cal-m <br>
the 'B' division would be the bottom level where new teams join, and if they don't make the top 4 or so, stay for the next season. <br>

	<div class="content">Looking at those line ups, no newbie is gona last two weeks in that open division.  There are 4 or 5 people that probably would be moved up to the top division pretty quick but by then probably as many newbies would have dropped.<br>
<br>
On another note<br>
As Fearsome stated, we have been discussing the possibility of a killlbox division.  One of the problems we are having is the fact that even within the killbox community, there are factions that prefer their server settings over others.  IE EYE fans prefer their settings, TSGK prefers theirs and it can be just as contentious as regular vs KB fans.<br>
<br>
So the question we have from the KILLBOX community is:  What settings would give a killbox league the best chance at having good participation?   What gravity, air acceleration, etc?  It would have to be standard for all maps so that the server cfg could be set for the best compromise.   <br>
<br>
Please only respond to this question if you are a killbox player.  Pomp if you could please put and announcement on the Killbox Steam group that this question is here and we need feedback.  Valar, I would also appreciate your input as well.<br>
<br>
For now Skull shock is off the table.  IMO they could go to the CAL higher ups and get this started on their own.   Right now for the DM division we have enough work with the possility of KB and B divisions as it is.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

thank you for your reply, but if you read my posts again and most of the replies we were talking about new players or semi-new players getting used to team play strategy.  not sure why you used 1v1 for your example. BUT now that i think about it, if there is a division of this nature for team play why not 1v1 as well.  I understand where your going with the B name as opposed to the standard CAL naming convention, but i dont think it was the name of the division that was the issue at hand, more of how it would work.  <br>
<br>
Look, IMO there is enough interest in starting this up, we can sit here and talk about it forever.  I cant do anything until i find out about my CAL adminship, but I am ready and willing to get this going.  Paradox has already offered to help me get to know the admin role and learn the basics if in fact i do get accepted.  I dont know who the other apps are, I think Zman is one and he offered to help me, I think Cellar may have applied, i know this is something he would love to do as well.  I have put a lot of thought in to this and I think a good name for the division would CAL development league, or CAL development Division.  *CALdl or CALdd*  because thats exactly what it would be.  A division focussed on development of team play, map strategy, communication etc.  the moving up and down Im not totally concerned about that yet because any team would be free to move up to the top division after any season if they feel they are ready, but if there is a team that is pwning every game i agree they should be moved up, but this will all be worked out in the division rules or mission statement.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It is vital that we have a low grav/killbox standard, not everyone will be happy unless its their setting but like everything else, for competition they will simply have to adjust to the rules and standards. Ideally having a representative from most major Killbox/low grav clans who will then sit down and discuss the issues at hand. That is basically what I will post and perhaps encourangement for them to sign in the U and have them post it all here open for everyone to discuss, I am with Para in that ONLY killbox, low gravity players would input, we need to keep the conversation flowing and not derail it with how much you "hate killboxes" [example]<br>

while it seems like a joke, I think he came up with that based on the standard that you have to have previously finished top 8 in the prior season. Considering it was a close battle with ties for the final 8th spot, I think the open would still be a pretty highly competitive division.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">it is a bit of a logistical nightmare.  standardizing the ratings/skill level for separate divisions.  lets use team v for an example.  a montage of different players from different clans entered their first cal season.  team v had a 2v2 and 4v4 team with a fairly robust roster of players that fluctuated slightly throughout the season.  but not every player rostered actually played a match.  and some team v members have scattered and may be on different teams next season.<br>

so, when we are discussing "new" to cal... what are we really saying?  is team v now considered cal experienced regardless of who they roster next season?  the team v roster (and other clans too) will have different players rostered from season to season.  it really comes down to individual players doesn't it?  and if so, what about a cal team that rosters half experienced cal players and half "new" players?  <br>

with team v, i didn't play 1v1 and didnt sign up for 1v1.  if i sign up for cal 1v1 next season, am i "new" and destined to the "open" division?<br>

with team v, i was rostered for 2v2 but played zero cal matches.  how would that be assessed?<br>
<br>
with team v, i was rostered for 4v4 and played only one cal match all season.  how would that be assessed?<br>

i dont have the answers, but im throwing these things out for more discussion.  if the "assessment" is left strictly in the hands of admins...  the admins are going to get hammered even more.  yet, i have no clue how a points system could be instituted to determine player assessments.  <br>

Check out the news From Dods Cal-o or Css Cal-o<br>
<br>
Generally there after playoffs Champs get moved up accordingly and by the need of division's  above.  Same is done after preseason. Same Can be done by admins in the middle of the season.  Now generally teams moving up from Cal-o don't keep there record when moved to Cal-m.<br>
<br>
Punk you are right, That was just an example i was  using to show how it would look, before and now.  That is why I have come to think that the best course would be Follow Clans United and every 8 players you make a new division<br>

Now we know plenty players left and plenty will join, some will leave and changes can be done in season.

This is the problem everyone is having with the idea,  By thinking of it as a "B" or sub par division.  It is Open or base level. And when you prove you are tops of the division you move up to the next level. <br>
<br>
 Now as with dod:source in season 3-5 Dod 1.3 died in cal so you had lots of Cal-I level players join the Cal-o division of Dod:source.  They played in preseason in Cal-o won by over 500 points each match under new names and got moved up to Cal-M and some to Cal-I.  Some came over under the same names from dod 1.3 Cal-i and got moved up on the spot.<br>
<br>
Moves like this are the reason I played dods for 5 seasons even though I never really enjoyed the game.  I could say, ok I want to create a dods team for cal for shits and giggles.  I did that and season one having never played before.  I Lead a team to 6-2 only losing to the two teams that played in the finals. Then all of the teams that made play offs other then mine moved up and my team was 8-0 in Cal-o and lost in Finals.  Then I had so many players I created 2 teams One moved up to Main and went 3-5 the other in Cal-open went 5-3 and made finals.<br>
Played for 2 more season under various teams. But had fun because the level of play was fairly even.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If we're discussing a complete overhaul of HL2DM in CAL there are plenty of issues to be addressed that have made CAL into a snoozefest for the past couple of seasons.<br>
<br>
1.  It's almost painfull to get 8 people in different timezones, with different schedules and different resposbility levels together at the same time.  Why not switch down to a 3v3 league?  Two less players makes for better play on most of the maps we use for 4v4. 4v4 has always seemed like a complete clusterfuck on most maps we play anyway and it's more difficult finding new maps that accommodate 4v4 play.<br>
2.  Limit the rosters.  We've got teams with 12-14 member rosters when only 4 or 5 actually play anyway.  Limiting the roster to double the team size (ie. a 3v3 team could only have 6 members) would give more people who've been riding the bench a chance to play, create more teams and make for more diverse levels of gameplay.  A limited team will certainly have to be more committed to playing, but with separate divisions for skill levels more people will be interested in playing knowing they won't lose by 1,000 every match they play.<br>
3.  Have an admin whose sole responsibility is recruiting for CAL.  There are more than a few clans out there that have no idea what CAL is all about and would possibly be interested in playing but haven't got a clue of where to start.  The CAL recruiting admin would act as a liaison to help them become familiar with where to register, help them with server set up, maybe take them through the process of a CAL based scrim to show them what to expect.  This admin needs to be visible, available, friendly and willing to help.<br>
4.  Enforce the rules.  I understand that in the past we've made allowances for this and that, but with new teams participating it sets a bad precedent.  Otherwise, "Well <em class="text-italics">Team X</em> was allowed to do it", will be argued from here on.  With this will come some major headaches because there will be new issues and arguments that arise and the rules will have to be scrutinized and loopholes plugged to keep the peace, but it will make the league more efficient, balanced and professional in the long run.  If there needs to be another admin just for this to ease some of the pressure on the division admins then so be it.<br>
5.  There is no "right" way to play HL2DM.  Don't get me wrong, I despise low gravity, I hate killboxes, but if you look at what people are playing in the packed public servers it's a very different game than what we think of as HL2DM.  CAL will have to develope some flexibility for the game to continue.  Part-time players aren't committed enough to learn advanced techniques but may still want to play in a tournament of some sort.  I don't have a solution here; maybe it's a killbox division, maybe shellshock, maybe something different.<br>
<br>
The question at this point becomes about our community's level of commitment to the game.  We can continue to have a half-ass league with a few teams dominating because their egos wouldn't allow any room for a loss furthering the lack of interest, or we can completely restructure CAL into a league for new players to not only have fun but to learn more about the game and generate more competition.  CAL will not build/rebuild itself.  It would take a ton of work on the part of admins, the community and the teams, but if you want CAL to continue things need to change.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was saying the same thing in IRC the other night actually. Poor Billy, if you need someone for your 1v1 team, I will be happy to partner with you. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>

A fine idea. A recruiter is always a good thing to have. Hmmm, maybe we could use one here too?<br>

My experience in the corporate environment, and as a Board Member for various organizations  tells me this is the best way to run things. Once you start being lenient, people tend to believe the rules are open to interpretation and are sure to get upset when disciplined.<br>

	<div class="content">I had always thought CAL was a bit, biased. Yes, I said it. There was no point in ever joining in 2v2 or 4v4 because who wins it every year? $W, VDuS, or flas. Nothing changed since season one. What's the point in joining to know you are going to get beat? The only solution that I had every thought to this was to split up the teams. Everyone knows everyone pretty well so why not split up VDuS or $W. These teams would be completely against it though. <br>
<br>
I always tell my coach how many goals I scored in a hockey game. His reply was always but how many assists (Passing it to a team mate to score) did you get? I'd usually reply 0, but don't quti reading yet. I think if we did split up the teams it'd be on the better players to get their team mates to get them better. This was what my coach was saying. "I know you're good, but can you make your team mates better?" <br>
<br>
I know that nobody will go for this, but it was just a thought anyways.<br>
<br>
And on the point of getting stomped on, I believe it was old time who said that this was his first CAL season and he played 2 matches. He said he got owned but had fun doing it. I call BS on this because I know from personal experience that nobody has fun getting beat and beat and beat. If we did mix up the teams, it'd be like draft night where everyone got a chance. Speaking of this though, I think it'd be a keen idea to have a draft night then use those teams for CAL. Draft night was pretty much ALWAYS even in the ones I played.

	<div class="content">i think it would  be good for cal to have more  divisions. i compare it with a poulair sport like football/tennis /. its so populair because there is a competetion for almost every level off age/skills.most players know that they are not becomming(or are) a top player but it gives alot off fun and satisfaction in youre life when you beat the other team/guy from the same division.<br>
cal schould have the for each world part(us/eu/..) its competetion with the same rules. with a good website where everything is binded.<br>

i hope you guys can solve all the problems that comes with it,and get it alive and working.<br>

Well good players don't want to play with people that are not equal to them in skill, plain and simple.  Nothing wrong with that, its just the way it is.  They want to win so they need team mates that can all pull equally to win.  Put someone with my suxzor skills on a team with SW or VduS quality players and they risk losing because I am a black hole of kills against my team when its like that.  <br>
<br>
Yes it would be nice to have teams more evenly matched because it would make the competetion more interesting but its not gona happen.<br>
<br>
For my own sake I have tried to get help to get better.  I do 1v1s and I get pummeled over and over with no feedback as to what I could do to improve so I don't learn anything so after a while you just kinda give up and learn to live with losing but it does get old.  Also how to look at a map and map strategy is something the "pro" players know but its a lost art for us relative noobs and yet another stumbling block among many.<br>
<br>
We have a few instructors but lately everyone is so busy and I don't see much happening with it and its starting to go back to the old way of you want to learn, go figure it out for yourself.  We need people to start teaching not just individuals the skills but teams the other finer points of the game.<br>
<br>
I really don't know what the entire solution is at this point but I do know we have to do something.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

While some people are talking about a overhaul that is not what is in mind. Some changes happen every season and will keep happening but you cant compare anything if you change 10 things at the same time to decided if they were successful or not. If a Killbox league is in then that will probably be the focus of this seasons changes. <br>
<br>
1 - of course less players is easier to coordinate. But its also less team play and less dynamic. This almost becomes pointless why have 2v2 and 3v3? If we were to look at this it should be along the lines of get rid of 2v2 and 4v4 and just have 3v3 so we can build 1 strong standard league like the euros have. But then again it still comes down to it hardly being a team play event. Also this issue is going to be worked against solving in several other suggestions. <br>
<br>
2 - this sounds nice on paper but put it into effect and I do not see the gain. Who has a roster loaded with bench warmers? Not $W most of our players are inactive if the roster gets limited Toad and Micah get cut as well as all the others that show up once a season. And we recruit new active guys to fill the spots. And those active guys actually will sit the bench. If a player truely is active and wants to play they move to a new clan on their own much like moose did. If your clan does not operate like this then you might consider changing policy. The large roster allows people who do not really want to play to serve as back up in the event you cannot get enough players which helps with point 1 if you are willing to play a B player. It does not serve to sequester active players and prevent them from playing. Enacting this rule will most likely make solving issue 1 harder for our game. <br>
<br>
3 - This is a good idea in fact it is what I brought nino in for cause I knew he would do this. And in fact he did. It is the talent any league desires most in him. <br>
<br>
4 - This was really not a problem till this season when some people were dead set on trying to make it an issue. In order to pull it off a complete rewrite of the rules needs to happen which is something we are always working on. Even so it will be a game killer for issue number 1. Main reason we relax is to allow people to complete matches who otherwise would fail. Finals would be toast this season under these rules as well as a ton of other matches. And members of your team would be suspended. Even if we did do it given what happened this season because we are not lawers there is no way we could write them perfectly enough to stop what happened. When people are dead set on trying to get a match overturned or causing a problem they will pick away at anything no matter how well written and then an admin has to step in anyway and make a call.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Why is it less dynamic?  A match becomes more playable and less about a clusterfucked, spawn killing, "I CAN'T FIND A FUCKING WEAPON" mess in maps that aren't suited for 8 people.  <br>
2v2 could stay or go.  That could be up to the CAL players to decide.  <br>
And you're right.  Heaven forbid that we should emulate the euros.  That craziness only works on foreign soil.  Would never work here.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"> <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>2 - this sounds nice on paper but put it into effect and I do not see the gain. </div></blockquote>
Of course you don't see a gain.  Refer back to the earlier pic please.  There's a few teams with 9-10 members that are all active players.  Limit that roster to 6-8 = have several more teams.  <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Who has a roster loaded with bench warmers? Not $W most of our players are inactive if the roster gets limited Toad and Micah get cut as well as all the others that show up once a season. </div></blockquote>
Then your "once a season" people would have to form a team and actually play through a season if they were interested in playing.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>And we recruit new active guys to fill the spots. And those active guys actually will sit the bench. If a player truely is active and wants to play they move to a new clan on their own much like moose did.</div></blockquote> <br>
You recruit new active people to sit the bench?  Why did he have to move on from sitting the bench when you could have limited the roster and allowed him to remain an $W member but play for or possible form his own team?<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If your clan does not operate like this then you might consider changing policy. </div></blockquote>
My clan operates just fine, thank you.  You seem to think that clan = CAL team.  We're talking about teams here, and the more you can get to participate in CAL the more flexibility you have in how the league is set up.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>The large roster allows people who do not really want to play to serve as back up in the event you cannot get enough players which helps with point 1 if you are willing to play a B player. It does not serve to sequester active players and prevent them from playing. Enacting this rule will most likely make solving issue 1 harder for our game.</div></blockquote>
You have a team of 14 and did not have a backup this season in at least one case, so a large roster didn't seem to serve you well.<br>
Players cut from a team will find/form a new team if they are active and interested in playing.  The season before this last, EE had almost a dozen players interested in playing.  We could have put them all on one team and let most of them ride the bench all the way through, but instead we formed the Misfits.  That made a new team for CAL, and gave them a chance to see what tournament play was like without having to sideline anyone.  <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>3 - This is a good idea in fact it is what I brought nino in for cause I knew he would do this. And in fact he did. It is the talent any league desires most in him. </div></blockquote>
My bad.  I should have known you had already thought of it and planned it that way.  <br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>4 - This was really not a problem till this season when some people were dead set on trying to make it an issue. In order to pull it off a complete rewrite of the rules needs to happen which is something we are always working on.</div></blockquote> <br>
It was made an issue because it should have been an issue.  No one else was willing to speak up about it.  It looks bad when a game manager goes against the rules at the last minute to get into the playoffs.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Even so it will be a game killer for issue number 1. Main reason we relax is to allow people to complete matches who otherwise would fail. </div></blockquote>
Relaxing rules is one thing.  Abandoning them for the benefit of saving face is another.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Finals would be toast this season under these rules as well as a ton of other matches. And members of your team would be suspended. </div></blockquote>
You just had to go there.  Members?  Grain was allowed to finish the season, so I'm supposing you found no evidence of hacks, although no one has actually come forward to exonerate him.  I don't recall you investigating anyone else on my team.  If you had something to suspend one or more of my teammates for then you should have done it.  I would have had more respect for you for it than bringing it up now in an effort to keep people on your side in a time when CAL players are unhappy with the way the league is being handled.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Even if we did do it given what happened this season because we are not lawers there is no way we could write them perfectly enough to stop what happened. When people are dead set on trying to get a match overturned or causing a problem they will pick away at anything no matter how well written and then an admin has to step in anyway and make a call.</div></blockquote>
You don't have to be a lawyer to have well written, concise rules and then follow those rules.  What happened this season is exactly what should have happened to point out the flaws in the system and where improvements could be made.  Any society, even a lame ass gamer's society that exists on forums and game servers, must be allowed to speak out in order to effectively change how things are managed if they are unsatisfied.  This season, although fueled by controversy and disdain for players/teams, was the most interesting ones I've been a part of.  The excessive delay caused a dramatic loss of momentum, but there is no doubt that this season will be one that is remembered.<br>
<br>
Whether or not you like my ideas or anyone else's ideas is secondary.  The point of this thread (although it started as a joke) is that CAL players are bored with the league and changes need to be made - drastic changes if you are to see participation continue.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

</div></blockquote>

before discussing a KB league I think the main focus of our CAL league should the expansion and growth of our current style of play.  I have put forth many ideas on how to do this, 90% of which have sparked interest in the community.  If we dont offer new teams a place to really be able to compete and learn it's not going to help CAL at all.  Teams like FF who just played their first season would be MUCH more likely to come play again if they knew they had a chance to win more than 1 game.  If teams like that and totally new teams knew they had a division to play in where they could learn team play, map strategy, comminication, and CAL rules, while have competitive games where the scores were close they would play.  keeping our current one division and then throwing in a KB division is going to do nothing for the ppl that currently play CAL and/or players looking to partcipate in the current style.  Im not saying im against a KB division, in fact im all for it, BUT if we are only going to focus on one addition this year, and I think most ppl would agree with this, we need to a development (or w/e you want to call it) division.  This will draw new teams, new admins, bring back players that have dismissed this league, and keep players/teams that are on the bubble as to whether they are staying or not.  Think about this for a second, right now we have players that are pissed off at CAL and the way its run.  They are pissed at getting killed every match.  They are not satisfied with playing in this league because they cant get the important skills down when they are losing games 300-100.  I would be willing to bet that if you looked over the schedule you would find that games that were between 2 teams that were equal in teamplay skill were played on time and those that were between 2 teams that were not even close to being similar in experience were either played late, or forfeited.  As with anything in life if you dont offer your customers an attractive product they are not going to be interested in it.  <br>
<br>
Here's what will happen if you keep the current division the way it is and you just add a KB division.  A VERY large percentage of the current players are going to say "screw this, its just going to end up like last season, im sick of it, i have better shit to do with my time"  new teams that were thinking about joining either wont or will quti after 3 week when they are 0-3 and -250 KDR.  you will end up with same 6 teams that are in the playoffs every season.  in turn you will have the community thinking thats all the admins care about and shun it even more.  Competitive players will do 1 of 2 things after they quti CAL. Go play in the warzone who is about to finish up a very successful first season, or go pubbing and put together scrims of their own.  all the while peaking over the shoulders at CAL seeing if anything changed only to find out $W won again, and their is a KB division.<br>
<br>
Here's what will happen if you make a development division and hold off on the KB division.  <br>
1) Current players will be willing to give CAL another shot now that there is a place they can learn the team play skills they are lacking and have competitive close matches at the same time.  their teamplay skills will dramatically improve with experience and in turn will move on to the upper division, improving that division as well.<br>
2)New teams hearing about this new division would be much more willing to join now that they have a "place to get started".  New players and teams will not only have fun playing in a good competitive league but will start to understand what it means to play like a team, to communicate effectively in team speak or maybe even figure out that there is such a thing as team speak, how important it is to stick together and starve other teams of supplies, learn to use the death cam to a teams advantage, how to listen to sounds around them for clues. etc.  this is my second season of CAL and im just starting to learn these things, BUT if i wasnt part of EE and didnt have the advantage of players with CAL experience in my clan, i would have been gone a long time ago.  A lot of these new players dont have that luxury. they join CAL cause they think its gonna be a pub league with standings, and they get smoked their first two games and quti. they dont stick around long enough to figure out that its not that they are bad players, just the teams they are playing against have the skills i just mentioned.  in a development division, they will be more willing to stick around and learn them.  <br>
3) the best form of advertising is word of mouth.  every new player that joins in this new division will have 5-10 friends they will talk to about it.  now instead of them saying, "forget it, dont bother, you will just get killed every game and the players are assholes" they will say "ya, its a lot of fun and we are having some really good matches, you should try it out"  lets say that this division started with 4 teams that would move to this division from the current one, and 4 new teams looking to get into CAL.  even if the new teams had only 6 players each and each if those players told 3 ppl about what they are doing thats over 70 ppl that may have never heard about CAL looking into it to see what its all about.  and thats conservative estimate.  it may seem crazy for us to think about but there are so many players out there playing hl2dm that have never heard of CAL before.  and the ones that have heard of it assume its a pro league that they will never have a chance in. <br>
<br>
SO, now, just by starting this new division you've not only kept a lot of good players you would have lost, attracted a lot more new players, sparked interest in the pub community but also you've made CAL an enjoyable place to play and learn.  <br>
<br>

Grain was never exonerated.  It's still open issue in fact. But funny how everything started back when Luke got back around, not when Grain got exonerated, which was the supposed reason for the break.<br>
<br>
I don't wanna waste my time advertising if the league could take a month break any time a $w isn't around for playoffs.  Shame, without this long break we would have likely had up to 18 teams with 11 returning, 3 up starts and 3 or 4 new to cal.  But now... 4v4 will be lucky to have 7 or 8 active teams.  Thanks for a huge waste of time advertising for the start of the season that looked to be only weeks away when in fact it was months.  And wasted time getting all the matches played creating some kind of buzz and momentum in hl2dm. From 57 matches with 3 forfeits to 14 matches with 5 forfeits, amazing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As a relativly new person to league play, I can truly relate to these sentiments.  I also have 2 seasons under my belt and we now have members of Khaos with that much time under theirs, but we are new as a team together and we need to work out the teawork aspects for our group as well. <br>
<br>
I will say that yes I do learn a lot more from the close matches than from the 100 to 300 ones where I can't even think long enough or move 10 feet before Im dead. There is no way to learn because you don't have time to try anything to see if it is even mildly successful.  It is very discouraging and I would be lying if I said the thought of saying "Fuck it I'm not doing this any more" hasn't crossed my mind.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nino, I think you are a great person personally.  You have a great personality and you will help anyone that asks if you can.  Your motivational skills and enthusiasm are awesome.  <br>
<br>
I will give credit where credit is due but, no offense, I also have to call things as I see them.<br>
<br>
Overall your ability to get teams motivated to play was a definte good thing and one that is needed.  Dealing with 8 teams in 4v4  to start off makes this a whole lot easier than 50 in 2v2.  Being a CAL admin is a volunteer position and its a pretty thankless job as you know.  Some of us can't spend the time chasing teams down and convincing them to play.  People join the league to play.  If you can't be responsible and follow through with what you signed up for why should I hold your hand?<br>
<br>
You may feel that you have greater experience running leagues (which I might add is less than stellar from what I hear) than Fearsome does and you may feel that you should be GM instead of him.  Well its just not the case.  The job is his and there is a heirarchy in CAL, he is in essense Ko's and yours and my supervisor.  Like us Fearsome also has people above him.  Do you blatently disregard your boss's decisions at work?  I doubt it because you would not be employed there very long.  I don't always agree with Fearsome either, but I sure as hell don't openly defy the decisions he makes and I don't question them on a public forum.   I discuss it with him privately and we hash it out.  <br>
<br>
You are also to blame for disenfranchising the player base because you created a lot of the drama this season by posting in these forums about Aces suspension which created HL2DM Drama episode number 1.  I wasn't even aware that he had been suspended until I read your post.<br>
<br>
Then you openly rescheduled matches when they were suspended creating what I will call Drama episode 3.  You found out that Ko and I didn't support your decision to do so.  The community figured this out when Ko and I had to post that these matches should not be happening and that in turn made the league and the admins look bad because we obviously were not in agreement on the issue.  Both Ko and I tried to engage you in a discussion in the CAL admin private section but you ignored us.<br>
<br>
And as far as the 5 forfeits in 14, I assume you mean the playoffs.  Well 3 of them were a result of the drama itself and the dishearting of teams. The other 2 were your own teams forfeits.  The first was your team refusing to play in childish display of unsportsman like conduct.  The second was your team insisting on the default time (knowing your opponent would have a hard time meeting it?) then your players not showing up when the other team had all of theirs ready.  The only reason the playoffs are finally over is because I set a hard default to cut the shit from happening. <br>
<br>
So I think this:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
Well you need to find someone for this job, 
</div></blockquote>

Is probably a mutual feeling.<br>
<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> (Uncle Rico)....a time when CAL players are unhappy with the way the league is being handled.</div></blockquote>

As I stated above, this was handled poorly by everyone involved and we all share part of the blame.  This has created a huge rift in the community that has truly been sad to witness.  It will take a community effort to heal that rift.  I am willing to work at it, are you?<br>
<br>
Now to Fearsome:  The community is calling for something to be done.  It may or may not work but I think you agree we have to try something.  We have some good people that have applied to help us.  I have discussed this with you at length and I am here to help you any way I can.  I suggest  you, Ko and myself have a conference and make some sort of decision and start moving.  I would suggest at this time that we immediately start an "o" division in 1v1 or 2v2 maybe both because this I feel is our biggest problem.  We also should put someone in charge of developing a KB division and perhaps a committee of 3 or 4 members from the different KB clans to hash out the details of a KB league.  I am willing to be available for any discussions or questions regarding the development of all of these divisions from an admin standpoint but also as a sounding board for ideas.<br>

The playoff suspension was more than long enough for an investigation.  If after 3 weeks you can't reach a decision then you have a problem.  That problem being that someone is desperately trying to find something that isn't there to keep themselves from looking like an ass or something else is going on.  I'm even more in shock to find out that the matter is still considered open at this point.  That's just pathetic.

I was the one using match comm for the flas match.  I did not INSIST on default time.  I told them to plan on Thursday, I wasn't definite about it and they had already said they were available most weekdays including the default.  I tried to reschedule after I found out my team was unavailable and they refused.  I'll take the blame for not knowing my team was away/busy, but I won't take all of it since the match still could have happened.  Either way, we were willing to let flas have the FW without argument. They were more prepared and more motivated to play in the finals than us and they deserved to be there.  Congrats to you flas members btw, you guys played a great season.

The "rift" is nothing but a result of disatisfaction and as you are finally starting to understand the majority is speaking out now against what went on this season.  We don't all share part of the blame.  We merely pointed out things that should be questioned.  Of course arguments will arise, that is how things are discussed and changes are made.  As long as people don't get their feelings hurt and try to retaliate by other means, things can be settled and we can move on.

OK Heres the facts about the time line of events, all backed up by the News on the CAL website and my fast DL server log (which I do not maintain myself, the host company does that).<br>
<br>
August 11th - the playoffs were suspended<br>
Somewhere in this time it was determined that non-cal demos were not admissible.<br>
August 24th - I get Grain's CAL demos in hand after several attempts to submit them over the previous week. I did not get them to Ko and Fearsome until at least 2 days later.<br>
September 2nd - Announcement that the playoffs would resume<br>
<br>
So in reality until the CAL demos could be looked at, there was no basis for judgement.  After the  CAL demos were in hand, a week later the announcement came that playoffs would resume.  Whether or not this has to do with Lukes schedule (as alluded to) I cant say because I dont watch his calender that closely. What its actual status is at this point I really do not know as I have not been informed either way.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div> The "rift" is nothing but a result of disatisfaction and as you are finally starting to understand the majority is speaking out now against what went on this season.  We don't all share part of the blame.  We merely pointed out things that should be questioned.  Of course arguments will arise, that is how things are discussed and changes are made.  As long as people don't get their feelings hurt and try to retaliate by other means, things can be settled and we can move on. </div></blockquote>

Again, a calm rational discussion would have been a much better choice, not creating drama on these forums and on IRC by flinging insults and accusations.  Then yes things can be resolved and progress made once again.<br>

 <br>
One thing about being an admin, is that you must have a thick skin.  Mine has grown considerably thicker over the past two seasons.  I dont take any of this personally, I am just trying to have both sides of the story presented, because there always is more than one side of the story, not just one perspective.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>  You've always been a helpful and considerate admin, available at any time for us players.</div></blockquote>

Thank you Rico, I do not take my job as admin lightly and I try very hard to remain objective and to do the best I can for the league. I consider many of you to be my friends and I hope to continue to do what I can.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>My only criticism is that you are standing behind someone who is about to be bulldozed by a disgruntled community.</div></blockquote>

Have you thought about why this is?  I pride myself in a high level of honesty and integrity and in real life it is one of the things I am known for.  I dont stand behind someone lightly and if I felt there was wrong doing I would not give that support. People are always quick to judge and first impressions are always the hardest to overcome.  I will admit, I once had gotten the impression from others that $W were an elitist group of snobs that looked down on everyone and just went around pounding on pub players for the hell of it.  I was intimidated by all of them because of their reputation.  I even ran away from them when they showed up in a server.  <br>
<br>
Since becoming admin myself, I have worked hard to get to know all of the admins, ops and others as well as possible by talking to them and by paying attention in IRC.  In the process I have found Conflict, Luke, DeathBringer and even Fearsome to be a cool bunch of guys (as well as yourself and others).  This means that the impression I once had from other people was quite wrong.  Fearsome doesn't talk much so its harder to figure him out, but I also know what the upper level admins and what others that have worked with him in the hl2dm world think about him.  I will tell you that most people's impression is incorrect, at least from my point of view. <br>
<br>
What I am trying to do now is to prevent this community by bulldozing itself by trying to keep the rational lines of communication open, to try and be open to ideas and to make progress on the things we can do to make CAL better.   It isnt going to happen overnight and people need to be patient and help out where they can by coming to the table with a cool head and mind to be part of the solution instead of trying to create more problems and more drama.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't know how this rumor got started, but I wasn't ever on vacation. There was a period where I wasn't on steam, because I was busy with school. But I was always in contact in case I was needed for a match, which is why I ended up getting back on steam anyways :/<br>
<br>
As far as killbox goes, I think that it plays better as a pub than with teams, but I tend to play more stock than killbox maps, so someone who is more accustomed to the latter may argue the opposite. These players also represent a large portion of the DM community, and they're highly competitive, so I don't see why they can't get their own league. A killbox only league might actually do pretty well, because those who are really competitive killboxers but not that great at stock will be able to excel in their field of preference. As far as mixing these two opposite styles of play though, I think it might start discouraging a lot of players from joining. So my suggestion is that we just have two leagues. One for killbox only, and one for stock. I think that would encourage the most players to join. What does everyone else think?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm not creating drama.  You may see it as drama, but it's merely discussion.  Things got more direct after Fearsome felt the need to point fingers, and although some of my posts have been a bit "harsh" as Zman put it, they serve a purpose.<br>

I'm really tired of re-living this.  This Para, is drama, what you had before was discussion.  But for the record, those are not complete facts.  <br>
8-11 Playoffs suspended<br>
8-15 Dispute filed against Grain - the email we received asked for the demos from the match being disputed and he submitted those within the time alotted. (48 hours)<br>
8-19 Another email sent from CAL requesting the demos from "the" match again.  If I'm not mistaken, I'm the only member of my team to get this email.  Not even Grain got it.  Not until I logged into the CAL site did I see a completely different message requesting all the demos which was several days later.<br>
I still have all these emails.<br>
8-24 After several attempts to upload the demos to the CAL site, you got them from him via ftp.<br>
8-27 We're asked for missing screenshots for our 2v2 team.  All of which were previously submitted via CAL's site or emailed to you after each match, but we re-submitted all of them the same day if I'm not mistaken.<br>
9-2 Playoffs resumed.<br>
I'm not sure who is resposible for sending the wrong messages, but the delay is still unacceptable.  Whether it's a person or CAL's message system we'll probably never know, but if the matter is still open without a decision, and the season went on anyway, then there was no need to suspend the playoffs in the first place.  This horse is dead.  We've beaten the absolute fuck out of it.  Let's drop the whole Grain/delay/hax/ewRareassholes/omfg nonsense.

Until the recent expression of player interest for split divisions, there were serious doubts as to the viability of 2 divisions per format, let alone 3. I think we will start with open and invite, for the 1v1 league anyway, and go from there.<br>
<br>
Likely scenario is: The initial invite division will be composed of the top 8 (playoffs) players from 1v1 s2/s3/s4 (omitting s1 as it was experimental in many ways). Top 3 from each subsequent open playoffs will then be moved to invite for the next season. Invite will also be locked to the specific steamid that was used at the time.<br>

Some arenas, like aim_arena or the tower arenas, have large amounts of vertical play while some killboxes, such as that circular tsgk box with only 2 levels (donut?) have almost no vertical play at all. Also, several arenas have lifts / bouncers / ramps, while some boxes have none, and visibility can vary quite a bit depending on the box or arena, with some having nowhere near 90%, often being under 50%.<br>
<br>
I think the main difference is that most arenas were created according to the same principles as stock maps- designed for 600g, pickups precisely placed, emphasis on the same advanced techniques that would be used in any other standard map. Killboxes break that mold by being made for various differing gravities, having dense amounts of randomly placed pickups, and generally not lending themselves to the techniques that dominate stock maps or arenas (though theres obviously some overlap; air control is a pretty dominant technique in low g killboxes, far more than it ever is in stock maps).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Why? Because Killbox maps are about hectic, nonstop, kill or be killed, gameplay. The strategy is shoot first and think later lol. <br>

	<div class="content">First off, CO OP league...yikes, but the killbox league was a good idea. The problem is that people don't want to compete. They lose a few matches and fade away. I, personally, got tired of scheduling issues. If you made the league to be held on specific days or times instead of a very gray default time it would be less stressful to the majority. Create regional divisions if need be. I have to plan ahead for matches. I need to know in advance. I can't go day by day and see who's on. Part of that is the age group in CAL. I'm on a pool league that plays on Sundays in the afternoon. People who play are there. It is important to them so they joined the league. CAL is chalked up to an internet maybe for most people. <br>
<br>
As for Val...lol I see more people complain about hopping than vice versa. Low grav folks seem to spite a good straffe jump even in 150 gravity. They call people cheaters in frustration against players that have destroyed their otherwise 2.0 kdr in a safe environment. There is a society that checks their rank on a server every 2 mins and leaves when someone "good" comes along. It's still an elitist complex as much as any CAL player. I have gotten accustomed to losing and I'm damn good at it if I do say so myself. People shouldn't be so upset to see their tiny world shrink.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of an open and invite division. Kind of like golf or tennis.<br>

	<div class="content">Hey guys and girls,<br>
<br>
I just wanted to point out a little something:<br>
<br>
<br>
The new HL2:DM Warzone site gives a new refreshing look to the start of its second season. Last season 8 teams competed in 3v3 Warzone with {EE} coming out victorious. Sign ups are currently underway for Season 2 as another competitive battle is yet to begin. <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">Things to look forward to this season are: a fresh set of competitive maps</span>, more active clans competiting and playing against each other in an intense season, more admins involved, and a fun atomosphere. One of the major rules this season that will be enforced is no flaming tolerated, you will be able to read more on this in the forums soon. Overall, Warzone has stepped it up a notch after the collapse of the CAL league which was HL2:DM's primary league for the past 2 years after STA's downfall. Now that both leagues are out of the picture Warzone looks to pick it up yet this time on a whole new level. Good Luck to all participants this season and the Warzone Team can't wait for another fun and exciting season in the competitive world of Half Life 2 Deathmatch!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Pre- Season Week 1 - dm_airfusion -- 07/19/09<br>
Pre- Season Week 2 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_octagon</span> -- 07/26/09<br>
Week 1 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_amplitude_r1</span> -- 08/02/09<br>
Week 2 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_lockdown_r5</span> -- 08/09/09<br>
Week 3 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_octagon</span> -- 08/16/09<br>
Week 4 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_biohazard_cal</span> -- 08/23/09<br>
Week 5 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_lostvillage</span> -- 08/30/09<br>
Week 6 - dm_caverns_r1 -- 09/06/09<br>
Week 7 - dm_airfusion -- 09/13/09<br>
Week 8 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_zeta_rc2</span> -- 09/20/09<br>
Playoff Week 1 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_amplitude_r1</span> -- 10/04/09<br>
Playoff Week 2 - dm_caverns_r1 -- 10/11/09<br>
Playoff Week 3 - <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">dm_lockdown_r5</span> -- 10/18/09<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, is it just me, or does that map list completely contradict the promise of new competitive maps?  Here we are, the remnants of a once not so fucked up game, trying to squeeze the last bit of life out of HL2DM as possible, and we're still playing leagues with maps that have been around for years.  Come on.  How is this helping the game?  Warzone has completely disregarded almost every HL2DM map maker out there with this map list.  It's a joke.  Lockdown as the finals?  Give me a break.  Caverns had 5 more votes than any other map, and airfusion had the same amount as LD, but we're stuck playing a ported-4 year old-single player map in the finals of the second season of Warzone.  Way to go!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's funny how your team is the only one to complain about the schedule because your team's best map was not selected for the championship round. This thread is completely irrelevant and only posted to cause drama once again. As far as I know that's all you guys are known for...<br>
<br>
As for "promises" there were no promises. I said "things you can look forward to", obviously some of those things were not met, not by my choice; but by the choice of the players selecting the "old" maps. <br>
<br>
For lockdown being selected for the championship map, lockdown has been the championship map for the past 4 years yes, however r5 has not been played on a full league schedule seeing how CAL had ended mid way without this map ever being in a complete season. I would like to see this map go through the full season and be played in the championship as its variations have been in the past. (The amount of votes had nothing to do with playoff maps, never said it was going to, and no one asked about it or questioned it before)<br>
<br>
There's your explanation, if you don't like it don't play, everyone else doesn't seem to have a problem with it. <br>
<br>
And its better than having nothing amirite? So be happy that I have put in countless hours and work to put up and run warzone for your ass or don't play. I could care less.<br>
<br>
For everyone else, thanks for participating and not complaining and making warzone be the most active since it's start.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

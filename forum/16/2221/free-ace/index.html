The banning was the verdict of the head admin; i recommended he be let off with a warning, but ultimately im not the highest ranking HL2DM admin and the decision was out of my hands.<br>

Also, the offense was somewhat worse than "missing screenshots", which is simply the official title for the ban.<br>

If it is something other then Screenshots then this shouldn't say<br>
<br>
"SUSPENDED UNTIL SUN, SEP 7, 2008<br>
Screen shots missing"<br>

	<div class="content">fair admin? yeah ok<br>
<br>
try arguing that he was fair when he did not include lockdown at all in sta, i just wish i remember whatever the joke map was he had in place which i got overturned on the sta forums. i'd prefer talking about the present, but it is important to establish that nino has consistently not been a fair admin. try arguing that there was not a hint of bias in choosing a map like swamplight or lostvillage for the finals map in the last two seasons of sta. i know swamplight has issues with team spawns, making it a less than desirable map, and it's not even used for the playoffs in cal. but why pay attention to reason when $W lost a match on swamplight to cyn in the prior season, or the fact that cyn's favorite map was lostvillage? but anyway, with respect to the here and now, you can futilely try to argue he is a fair admin now when he purposely schedules his team for the 1 match on the only map he knows his team can win on, even though at the time the standings should have placed $W vs flas. this is a fact, so don't talk shit about what you don't know about<br>
<br>
another gem from this season: i have been asked not to post the direct quote from match comm, so i'll summarize for you. $W's match vs 911 on july 10. we had issues playing over the weekend and 911 had issues with playing on monday so we naturally compromised to play on tuesday. unfortunately on monday, $W was credited with a forfeit loss. 911 did not report the loss, it was none other than ninojman reporting a forfeit loss to $W a day before the scheduled match. yep totally fair. protip for cal: it is not the admin's place to report forfeit wins like that against a team, not to mention when the two teams had agreed upon a date, which was the following day<br>
<br>
so do not try to crucify a good admin when there is another bad admin pulling much more egregious shit: and the important thing to remember is that this bad admin is a repeat offender. i've been around the block with dezo and trash, i know admin abuse and bias when i see it, kid</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
to much stupid cry baby shit to even talk about in this post,  $w is lucky i didn't Deactivate them the week before 911,  And yeah if any match wasn't finished before default whichever team couldn't make default got the forfeit.  Ask any team in 4v4 this season, shit ewr even got a forfeit forced against them in the $w match since we needed to play on the following monday.  Auto-scheduled btw.  But keep crying man it's funny<br>

last season i had a problem with scheduling, i didn't think we should've been matching w/e team we were set up against (i do not recall who) i was reassured by several admins (including fearsome) that matches were randomly selected.<br>

i may be wrong, but again this is what i was told so if not true, it only shows that it has been happenign for some time even before nino became an admin.<br>
<br>
no lockdown: boot up single player bum looker.<br>
<br>
and about the forfiet loss, did you follow through with the the date you guys planned? this happend to my team, and several others as well so nino could continue to schedule on time for the teams that had completed their matches when they were suppose to. We did our match, and it was reported. So were several others.<br>

you're talking about how unfair nino was, but all you have to bitch about so far are: him following cal rules and him not picking the map you prefer for finals.<br>

if thats a terrible admin i'll take him over the "we don't need to tell you shit, or abide by the rules we established" mother fuckers anyday.<br>

that's great, i assure you that i have a bridge in new york i want to sell you for a couple bucks<br>

point well taken. you are right i do not keep up with shit with this game, so i can't really speak in favor of or against fearsome. i'll even admin i lold when i heard about ace's antics, i thought it was funny<br>

you are also correct in saying why should i even bother when the people i am arguing against are a bunch of 16 years olds whose retorts don't go beyond "butthurt fag!" or "whiner!"<br>

<br>
In case you missed that date,  which is what happen with the 911 match.<br>
<br>
Now you answer me this.  Why should $w even been given a match on july 10th?  They had just forfeited to flas and then mfya with no response in match comms.  Any other team would not get a match.<br>
<br>
I don't know why you have always just lumped me in with the cyn guys and hated on me. while you are at it just join #thewarroom and pm.  If you wanna go there do it post the ss from the 2v2 i don't care i got raped it sucked.  Still a few shots made up for it.

i have to totally agree with this quote.  this is why i never come on this site.  always nothing but arguing and bitching, it's like a f-ing hen house.  it's a God damn video game, supposed to be for having fun..............not making enemies.  i just wish everybody would relax, when you get older you will realize how insignifagant all this BS is.  take a step back and really think about what your fighting over, is it worth it?  idk, i just hate it.  i personally dont think nino is doing anything to hurt the league, in my opinion he tries his best to get games played and to keep the league flowing.  i dont think most of you have the slightest idea how hard it is to run a league, enforce rules, and still keep everybody happy.  anybody who has ref'd a sports game knows what i mean.  he shouldnt have to deal with all this bs as well, i for one give him a lot of credit.  as for the luke thing.....grow the fuck up.  i dont even know luke but i know any of you would have been devistated if that happened to you.  and if you sent a screen shot to an admin who was just looking for a game SS then you are a dick, and obviously arent mature enough to be an adult.  i realize that a lot of you are young and immature and i do take that into consideration when i read these posts.  but you know what.....you're gonna find out real quick that life isnt fucking fair, you ARE going to get the shaft...... A LOT, and there's jack shit you can do about it.  nino isnt getting paid for this, he does it for you guys, he stepped up to the plate and became an admin, without ppl like him you wouldnt even have a league to play in.  if you're cheating, then you're cheating, if you're a dick to ppl than you are a dick to ppl.  but if you get caught except the punishment like a fucking man.  none of this shit was done by accident, it was all done on purpose by ppl who were trying to start shit, so dont do it if you cant deal with the consiquences.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I agree that these forums do contain a lot of bitching, but I am also a firm believer in freedom of speech, so I wont delete something unless absolutely necessary. Sweeping things under the rug causes a lot of mistrust and accusations of taking care of your inner cicle, which is much more detrimental to a community than leaving it all out there for everyone to see.<br>
<br>
Moderating a place like HL2DMU is a very fine line at times. Unfortunately we will never be able to please everyone. People who think we are not strict enough will leave because certain content bothers them, others will leave because they think we are forum nazis deleting all their (funny in their opinion) threads. <br>

most of the people that posted in this thread are CAL players and i think that gives them the right to give they're opinion about CAL related issues.<br>

I don't agree with everything in this thread, and i do think some people are taking it a little to seriously but i have a feeling these threads wont be shit to compared to whats going to be happening within the next 2 weeks, so... if this disgusts you'd stay clear of the league discussion for awhile.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It probably doesn't feel like you have a right because your not smart enough to realise the now passed potential of possible administrator abuse that effects every single one of us in CAL and how Fearsome at the end of the day is accountable to the community, not himself or the CAL admins above him no matter what anyone says. If Fearsome was shown to not be competent to rule and hand out final judgements in a fair manner, this effects ALL of us.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ofcourse, he is a part of my clan and we are good friends. I will tell you this though. If he was someone that was known for being an ass, had been walking a thin line with admins, and was then suspended for doing something stupid (this is in theory, I dont know ace and have no idea if he is this way). I would tell him that he deserved every bit of it and he would probably be removed from our group. I could really care less though if someone got suspended and they didnt wear the same tag as me.<br>

	<div class="content">I'd like your feedback here before I finalize this list. In order to allow people flexibility with their choice in maps, I want to have a list of approved maps that people can choose from. I also want to make sure, however, that people aren't forcing their opponents to play on maps that aren't fit for league play - like maps that have secret passages, low gravity, etc...<br>
<br>
So here are the maps that I've approved for 1v1. Think a map doesn't belong here? Think I forgot one?<br>

dm_organic_b5<br>
dm_resistance_r1<br>

Just let any team pick any map then they put the map up on a list before the season starts and if someone has a major objection like a modern system can only get 5 fps in it or someone spawns in the walls then it can be rejected. <br>

To have been more clear only about 1-2 competitive maps are being entered in the contest, the rest are more leisure, pub based maps. I am not entirely sure either of these two rumored competitive maps will be even league ready. One at best new map for competitive play is not really worth it to enter in a system of forced map play. Good point nonetheless da1.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think it does matter, what's the point of forcing now old maps to be played in a forced map rotation? Instead of being vague why dont you give us examples of new maps that are better then this rotation being picked out by prospective clans so far. <br>

We are not going to force maps right? Each team or player will pick a home map.<br>
So then why even bother with an allowed maps list? <br>
You just pointed out only 5 maps are being considered by clans why bother battering around for a week on what is a good map or not when we could just allow clans to pick any map they want and then tell them no only if the map has major issues. <br>
<br>
It is clearly less work to just allow clans to pick any map they want then tell them no if it is a problem then to try and flesh out a complete list of allowable maps. Last CU season only 5 maps were picked. Why are we constructing a map list of 20 maps when most clans will just pick the same 3 everyone always picks. <br>
<br>
I have 30 GB of maps and I have not gone through them all and I would bet no one has gone through all the maps so if a clan finds a jewel in their opinion just let them pick it as a home map then we can look it over and if there is a major problem reject it or ask for it to be fixed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Uhhh because we just had some issues last night with exactly that. A clan picked a map that was only made for 1v1. Limits have to be drawn otherwise a clan will just pick, say aim_arena out of the dark to counter blasphemy's leet orb skills. Aim_arena was used in CU, and it turned out to be a big mistake. Lines have to be drawn on appropriate maps IMO.<br>
<br>
All this is beside that fact every person I've asked for an opinion on having a forced map rotation has said no so far. The debate is pretty moot at this point.<br>

IF efps is going to be like the 2v2 tournament is then yes, you most certainly need a map pool. It should be smaller too. You can't expect people to have learned 20+ maps when only 4 or 5 of them are ever used in scrims.<br>

aim_arena for 3v3 would be an example of a major problem btw. Just say tough luck and make them pick something else before the season starts.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We may decide against having a clan locked into a single map the entire season, in fact I'm leaning against that right now. If the eFPS forums get up soon enough we may just hold a community vote on the matter.<br>

I mean if it was a small amount of maps then it wouldn't matter cuz it's reasonable to just learn em all but that's a sizable list derr. <br>
<br>
Or here's an idea for more flexibility. For each week we play have a team pick any (approved) map they want for that week. Like have them state the map choice in the beginning of the new week so teams have some time to get to know the map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here's where I'm very strongly leaning at this point.<br>
<br>
When two teams meet up for a game, neither team will need to have declared their map pick beforehand. They just say "We want to play on X map," and the other team says, "OK, we pick Y map." The one stipulation is that X and Y must be maps from the approved map list. I don't think its at all unreasonable to require competitive teams to have at least a working knowledge of 20 maps. Most players in this game know how to play quadruple that amount. And, remember, just because a map is on the list does not mean that it will be played. It's up to individual teams to choose which map they like best from the list. Teams won't be locked into a map for the season, either. They can pick a different map for each match.<br>

Does this require teams to actually learn some different maps besides LD, LV, Cavs, and LA? Yes. And that's the point. But we're not going to make you play on any map that neither team chose. I understand that some people won't like the idea of having to learn more maps than they've been playing lately. But, in the long run, this is a good idea. We're all tired of playing the same four maps over and over again. Additionally, it adds some suspense to the league with the question of "what map will our opponents pick?" And I think that's a great thing.<br>
<br>
We have 22 maps on that list. There will be a least two weeks from eFPS sign-up to the first match. That's plenty of time to run through the 10-or-so maps you're not completely familiar with.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As for the idea of learning 20 competitive maps for a season... maybe to pubstar / pug proficiency level, not to mastery. So sure, theyll all know where the rocket is and wont get lost etc, but the resulting generic level of strat and execution isnt going to make for epic matches or srctv viewing; matter of fact, itll probably be pretty random.<br>
<br>
Also choosing maps from a big list at the beginning of each match was tried in one of the early cal seasons and just resulted in constant counterpick attempts, rolls of teams who hadnt mastered the obscure map chosen and an according sharp increase in teams dropping from the league. The seasonal home map system is almost certainly superior (the almost being dependant on the wtf level allowed in seasonal map choice).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

also how do you know people can just dominate hydroponics because it happened against a team that was not creative or prepared. Alot of people think that about alot of maps but people figure out ways to counter it.  Until a map is given adequate time to be fleshed out how do you know. And I think alot of maps in the list are like that the only difference is people know them better, and know how to counter them. If you want diversity make people figure out how to counter something. Or just go get that spot first and watch the team never pick the map again.<br>

Sry Fear, sometimes you do have good ideas, but this is just silly.  If a map is to get banned it should be for having a broken spawn, or area.  Not because it tried to recapture glory from a different DM game.  This should mean it is tried and tested.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'd expect as much empty criticism from a person who isnt competitive. How many times do I need to tell you the closest matches we've been having in years is under the new pick your map system. Go check CU results and the summer cup results. Seriously your just an armchair speculator, you don't even know what goes in the competitive community, how we play, what we like and you pretend you have knowledge that helps. Critiques about the competitive community coming from a guy who didnt know you can blow up SMG nades easily and who is easily one of the worst players ive seen when you played in draft, pfft.<br>
<br>
Facts can speak for themselves, please go look at the archived STA match results under a forced map system and the deficits between the winning clan and losing clan and look at the most recent results of our league matches and come back to tell me your findings. Oh BTW, you must've not known clans have been disregarding the forced map selection in draft too, about half of the draft matches we've played we've just agreed to play caverns instead of the forced map. Freedom of the community to make their own choices is HL2DM's future, not silence and oppressive choices made by a secretive ziggurat chain of admins.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Community already voiced their opinion on the matter in a vote in this section, your vision is soundly rejected. Freedom is the future, oppression and admins "knowing whats best" for everybody is the past. BTW you know only one clan in the summer cup picked cavs consistently and that was us (em0).

Yeah they went into overtime because you guys did wins by rounds, not by frag amount. Also a mistake IMO. Some players I know win by 1 on aim arena, but lose by 10-12 on lockdown.

sta did both systems,  just like the maps everything was being worked out how to play.  Rounds had it's merits, but frag is surely better for hl2dm.  I don't mind the pick your own choice for the league.  My only problem is a team could kinda be forced to play their best map rather then something different and out of the comfort of that team that is picking.  Was a hybrid ever discussed?

Yeah I thought that was what we were doing all along. Schedule a map week by week before the season starts. For instance bmc is planning on using Asylum, LV, r5 and caverns this upcoming eFPS season. You would have to make your map choice known in advance in the beginning of the season. Or perhaps you just want to have the same map set for all weeks for your clan, you can do it that way too. Or you can have all different maps for all weeks.<br>
<br>
So we will schedule the season, make a graph available, then you need to fill in the graph of what map your choosing for the week/clan. Once all teams have submitted their map choices and know their opponents it will be good to go wherel then we will make a complete graph available for all to see with everyones map choices and opponents. <br>
<br>
Simpler terms/example; bmc vs $W week 1/ BMC chooses R5, $W chooses zeta/end</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My comment was never about making close matches or about admin lording over folks.<br>
<br>
It was about mixing it up and keeping things fresh.<br>
<br>
Having a pool of maps and then randomly assigning them for the season would give teams fresh maps and a little time to practice and get to know them.<br>
I don't believe just having folks show up and play their own favorite maps makes good sense for a league.<br>
It has to have structure in order to be successful and fun.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with my skill in this game.<br>
I admit i am a poor league player/tdm player, but that is besides the point.<br>
I take back the profanity directed at Valiums.<br>
I should know better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">HL2DM isnt the only game I played competitively and wont be the last. Many of the largest most well known tournies including the ones in Starcraft 2 I am starting to get into allow you to chose your map preference. Its a matter of administrator discretion, it so happens I just believe in executing what the community wants, not what I think is best for them.<br>
<br>
If people want to start a petition the day eFPS goes up to remove me from adminship after being the chief architect for helping holy to develop a community vote based league/forums, I would happily accept my fate because its what people think is best as ironic as it would be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Where did you divine all that from the post? I was merely referring to my belief that is so strong into a community based league that I would let them vote me off the island even though I made helped make the island in the first place. I never suggested you were challenging my ability to admin, take a breath and drink a Steel Reserve kiddo, hell I wish I had a case right now in fact.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

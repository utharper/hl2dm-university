	<div class="content">I have suspected v0z of cheating for some time. Tonight, he was banned from an anti-cheat protected server for attempting to execute LUA scripts in order to allow him to wallhack. This, combined with the previous screenshots of him executing wallhacks (in b4 denials), has led me and Da11as, as two of the three eFPS admins, to believe that v0z has demonstrated a pattern of disregard for fair play. As a result, we have decided to suspend him from all eFPS play for one year. Valiums is the other eFPS admin and he did not vote on this issue because Da11as and I agreed.<br>
<br>
This is the relevant portion of the server log.<br>

<br>
also its the real cheaters that dont get caught and the ones that dont get the blame</div></blockquote>

KAC bans arent permanent. 1911's KAC version was older then the current KAC we have which would explain why he is able to enter servers say now besides the fact he probably wasnt banned permanently. <br>
<br>
Either way like I said GG, strong effort by v0z and yourself at the end there. Besides how many times have you been banned from leagues raz? Let's see, three by me, one by CAL, one by CU european league. That's 5 league bans total.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Oh yeah funny story, Battery was going to 2v2 SpD, it was ted and McGee vs. me and nervous.  McGee went into spectate and we were wondering why, then Gibbs joined. I immediately checked vOz's account and saw it was last online 2 minutes ago, suspicious enough eh?  But wait, it gets better, throughout the whole match raz/ted was saying things that pointed out voz was gibbs, and gibbs never said anything except for gg after the match.  So after a 20 minute match, mcgee was telling us to get our facts straight, ted/raz calling us dumbasses, and gibbs not saying anything..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok so lets have it out.   Should people that have been vaced in another game be allowed to play in a league?<br>
Of course this assumes we can even set that rule for any new league we join as that is yet undetermined.<br>
<br>
If we can make that rule and the answer is no not at all, then we need another admin to track all DM players that either have a vac on a current account or have been vaced on any account ever.  This also assumes you can prove that said previous vaced account was in fact theirs.  I am not willing to be a vac watch dog so someone else is going to have to do it.

	<div class="content">I don't think they should even though i admit that i have used a wallhack in another game for fun. But then what are we promoting and it would probably lead to more drama which i think we already have enough of. But it will be hard to know if someone had a vac'd account and i dont think you could really enforce this</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yep I agree it could get pretty fucked up, but some people mentioned it so I decided to ask the question and get some feedback.<br>
<br>
It would be almost impossible to enforce because if someone has a new account, you may not know hes got 3 more that are vaced unless youve know the guy forever.  Even then there would be hard to prove an old vaced account belongs to anyone in particular unless you matched IPs or something from a server rcon-status shot with the steam ids showing.<br>
<br>
It would be possible to keep any current vaced accounts out of it by requiring a link to their steam account with the steam id number, but again how can we not make sure that the screen shot isnt actually thier buddy whose account isnt vaced and they just used the same avatar and shit.<br>
<br>
The whole thing could become a huge fucking mess to keep track of.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hacks accusation in this game are futile, nothing can be 100% proved, and when it is, no action is taken, theres 2 days of drama on these boards and then life goes back to what it was.<br>

	<div class="content">Well.. seeing as how some of you think that my personal life is somehow your business, let me assure you that it is not. Nor is it your responsibility to inform everyone on the matter in an immature fashion.. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am a good person who only wants what is best for this game, and having a community splitting apart, players being singled out, drama in only official league in the game is not what I had in mind. This is not a money game, so the only thing it has going is friendly competition which takes mature players and good sportsmanship to work. As far as the whole Kigha thing goes, it seems as though nobody is going to drop it unless I step in, so let me assure you right now that I do not date minors nor do I have any desire to. When kigha and I were together, she was "19". A month later, she confessed to be "23". Later "16" and now "15", and none of you can say for sure how old Kigha is, so if you want to continue to split this community up and single players out, then you obviously have no desire to build a stronger, more united community, but rather destroy this very unique game which many still have fun playing.<br>
<br>
For those of you who see the situation for what it really is and see these immature bullies trying to tear people apart with no thought of this community, then i suggest to you, as someone who wants to see this game continue to grow, to stand up against these people and don't let them take away the only thing that this game still offers... fun..<br>
<br>
Good games to everyone, and I hope that you make the best decision.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

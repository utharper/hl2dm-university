	<div class="content">ya thanks for being a you know what pb, seemed people mostly wanted this to happen and we are trying it under the idea that there is some significant amount of teams that do not play because they do not like to get hammered by the top teams. If it does not work we can recombine the divisions. Currently anyone who wants to sign up for the upper division can. It is up to teams to decide on their own if they can handle the upper division or not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well the community complained about it constantly, now I gotta hear how doing what I was asked to do is wrong. Was not my idea. Like WT said damned if you do damned if you don't. <br>
For right now everyone can pick where they want to go. However if there is a problem the admins of the league can move a player up to main or just stop scheduling them. Our hope is people will be mature enough to fit them self into the right place. And we will not have to go through technicalities of how to choose players which will still surely end up placing some good players in the open division. Also even if 1 or 2 players fairly good are in the open division hopefully only playing them once or twice will not ruin the season for you.<br>
Also is it a terrible crime if you have to play the same team twice in a season if its small? Most of us scrim the same team over and over on the side anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've played cal in css before, and they have cal open, cal invite, cal intermediate, and cal main. what they did was, when cal first started for css, they placed ALL teams in cal open, and then judging upon each team's score (end of season) they placed the teams in each division. so you might want to do that with hl2dm also.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">There is a difference between our system and CS. CS creates multiple divisions more to protect the upper teams from the riff raff below constant FLs, cheaters and so on. And because they have thousands of teams. They also used it for CPL seeding. Our point is exactly the opposite we are looking to make a division which gives lower calibur teams a place to play where they do not have to compete with high level teams that will out score them 10:1. Because we are told teams do not compete because of the high skill differential. And because we dont have enough lower calibur teams to let the current scheduler give them good matches. <br>
<br>
CS requires you to basically do a season in order to move up a division. So you must basically nail at top place in open to move to main, and then main to move to premier, and then to invite. We dont want to exclude a new teams which is good from playing in main. We are more likely to just tell a team that is good they cant play in Open. How this would work in HL2DM is a team like blas and invx who rename themself every season would have to play open first. And of course because I did not make playoffs in 1v1 I would have to rocket whore the open 1v1 division for a season or so not that I am the greatest player but do you really want me rocket whoring open? <br>
<br>
All I am saying is generally I think each team out there has a good idea of where they stand. And I am going to leave it up to them to choose where they want to be for the first season. If it becomes a problem we can force teams to move. Maybe we should give the captains of the open division the ability to vote and force a team up to main with a nomination as well. But just keep in mind our system is not the same as CS.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Great stuff, pb was mad.  But I explained it to him of how it will be a good thing for the league in general and make the main and open seasons more fun for everyone.  Getting up by 20 points in under 5 minutes then just running around for 15 minutes is no fun for anyone.  <br>
<br>
   However I'm not sure about the format.  Don't look at css, but dods.  dods is smaller then css and like hl2dm if a team is too good they can get a lead in 5 minutes that you can't get back from and you have to play 2 rounds of 20minutes. Css doesn't matter because the match can be over in 7 minutes if the team is a lot better in skill then the other.  Season 4 or 5 of dods this team from dod 1.3 that never played dods joined open.  All the admins knew they were good so they moved them up to invite after playing preseason, and the team went on to beat the 4 time defending Invite dods champs.  Good move on the admins parts since  they didn't belong in open<br>

I've told you 100 times this doesn't have to be the system, move up the good players from open by hand.  If someone destroys the competition in preseason or first 4 weeks in open move them up.  It doesn't have to be done based on only the people that made playoffs.  Do it on skill   <br>
    4v4 I'd would mind seeing $w,flas,911,ewr,mfya for main (although the upper division should be even).  If cyn comes back in full force move them straight to main don't let them play open for a season.<br>
<br>
Also don't make more work for you because every bs css player will join main if it is a choice.  Maybe do a longer preseason to figure out where people should be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Generally when you get moved up/down you do not take your record with you.  You can do make-ups if you have the time.  But that doesn't mean admins couldn't make it so teams keep their record I believe it was done one season in dods.<br>

So I suppose that if we build it they will come?  <br>
This game is not actively promoted by Steam or by Valve and yet you assume that people will just magically show up in CAL ready to play?  Not happening.  CAL HL2DM has to be built.  If you plan on having more divisions, you're gonna have to create teams, otherwise, you're setting up another CAL season of epic fail.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is indeed true.<br>
<br>
However, genetic mutations of an entire species don't occur overnight, so whatever chickens evolved from it was a slow process.  It didn't magically hatch as a chicken when it's mother wasn't one.  So since each egg with a chicken who has a mutation in their chromosomes can arguably be a "first member of a new species," the answer is really neither.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

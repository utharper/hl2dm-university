	<div class="content">I know for fact that some people do bind those keys and that no one should be banned for running them or accidentally running them unless they bypass . Which was contrary to what you seemed to think. And if an anticheat was to detect them it would be the duty of any honest admin to know this and disclose it to anyone involved in the league with fair warning. <br>
<br>
Think of it like this I design an anticheat to ban people if they have any player footstep sounds or models replaced in their directories. This should not matter if I was on a pure 2 server but it would have banned you dallas even though you were unable to use them during league matches with sv_pure 2 enabled. <br>
<br>
And as I said the troubling part is not so much that some random hl2dm player made that statement but that a league admin and mapper did it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well for about the fourth time I've stated in other threads just the commands alone will not ban. You must execute a LUA script FIRST. Go try our eFPS servers and try any of the impulse or console cheats, it wont ban for it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL WTF. Sooooo luke looks exactly like I expected, wiry, tall, smart, slightly conceited but loveable. Consti looks EXACTLY like I expected, a little shorter, energetic and brash. Conflict looks like a fucking bear jesus, if Luke is supposed to be about 6'2-6'3 that would make Conflict 6'5 about. Remind me not to fuck with conflict if I go to Canada.<br>
<br>
Also ninjins lawl, he acts like a douche, looks like a douche but I still love him. Edge, yeah pretty normal. <br>
<br>
@fearsome..... yeah what can I say, thats unfortunate. Still he's not the 40+ year old guy corpse I thought he was lawl.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ye, sorry I got excited to see people I've been playing against for 4 years for the first time in an actual photo. You'll also realize people don't grow up, appearance is everything. Go to a dinner with millionaires and find out how much people care, they care more then gradeschoolers trust me.<br>

As if money is everything; I'm talking about showing others respect, and showing some decency.  Hanging with millionaires who seem to have everything going in life, does not mean they are what everyone should strive to be.  They can be just as much of a prick as you've shown to be here, in this thread, and many other places.<br>
<br>
I'm saying, just because you don't particularly agree with Fearsome, or you may not like him, does not mean you have to stoop to those levels, of attacking him.  This, is why, I am saying grow up, because it's the kind behaviour you see most of the time in kids from grade school, who are insecure and trying to show everyone how awesome they are.<br>

There is none. This thread was basically a useless pissing arguement between dal and fearsome even though I believe Fearsome already had his answered question well before this thread.<br>
<br>
@para, I didnt mean to generalize like that, yes its very true the upper class isnt full of soulless people. I'm speaking from my own personal experiences about appearences when my dad dated the former executive vice president of Rockwell corp. that the dinners we went to people would  judge you on how your fucking pocket square was folded or how you held your silverware. I still hold to my guns I've never met some more soulless, heartless people then some of those people. But hey, after some painful lessons if anyone needs tips on when sport jackets with gold buttons are appropriate or not, or why 2 button coats are more fashionable then three button coats give me a hollar son.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">What do you guys think about having a set map list for 1v1 instead of the player choosing the map? like in TDM<br>
<br>
I personally think it fits league play more and that way we arent stuck playing same 2-3 maps all the time... because naturally the player is going to pick the map hes best at... which in a sense defeats the purpose of league play imo....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i would be for it, as the person who 'dominates' their selected map will get an easier win.<br>
how would you get it to work?<br>
would it rotate each week similar to tdm, right? except maps that are more conducive to 1v1.<br>
<br>
i think you're going to get grief from people who like the system the way it is. but i as newer player would be happier to force people from playing their 'favorite map' to change things up a little.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nope, I don't agree at all. That's the purpose of 1v1, you have to be prepared for anything, and be good in all the maps. So let's say the maps would be chosen each week like tdm, you would practice that map the whole entire week, but that doesnt mean your good at it, because you just played it 6 days in a row non stop. But, if you each choose one map the same day, you need to get good at every map, not only focus on one map, then another one and forget everything about the last one. I think the CAL 1v1 rules and settings should stay like they are.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Its your choice if you decide to practice a map right before u need to play, which wont end up very well id imagine. The map list will be out the whole season... for those who do not already know all the maps, have the entire season to get better with them. The point of this league is to show who is the best at diversity. I only played 4/8 maps the entire season, not very diverse. U are going to have to be prepared long before the map is going to be played or your just wasting your time anyways. By only playing your best map is hardly diverse at all, and i get the feeling, alot of players best maps are the same :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I could go either way on this but I kinda agree with what Bahlk said, I only played aim arena and LD all season. I'm for trying new things and I wouldn't mind going to a set map list. Change is good and diversity keeps things fresh. The only plus to having your pick is that if your playing someone tough, you can pick your best map and have the best chance to win. MY only problem was that my best map was everyone else's best map lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here is some thoughts behind this issue.<br>
<br>
I would like to run all leagues with 3 maps if we could, the problem is that the difference in models is not fair so the solution is what we have in team leagues (plus team leagues have 20 minute rounds and 2 rounds stays under 1 hour). All major 1v1 competitions in quake or anything else are run with 3 maps. In 1v1 you get to choose your model so both can be rebel and usually are. To reduce the work load we have only 8 maps to choose from which is not much and many do not change from 1 season to the next. <br>
<br>
It is very true in the start that nearly all good players picked Lockdown or aim arena as their 1v1 map but quickly some players learned that did not help them much. In every single 1v1 season the player who won picked an unusual map from the list as their home map. This resulted in them almost always winning that map then needing to get good at the tie breaker. If you pick a map like Lockdown which everyone is very good at then your chances of winning even your home map are diminished because other players are already experts in that map. Just look at the the last 3 seasons in every one of them the 2nd place guy picked Lockdown as his home map and was defeated on it its a perfect 100% pattern so far. The same is true for FIOS. This aspect  of capitalistic play is what will drive people to diversify the maps they choose. It is odd that it has taken this long for people to wake up to it though. <br>
<br>
Also different players are just different meaning even if they practice all week some heavy aim oriented players are never going to beat me with a rocket on zeta, and some guys like me who are heavy on strategy and poor on aim are never going to beat much of anyone in an arena map.  By giving me a choice I can at least win 1 match and practice for the tie breaker however if the maps are set. Then then I am completely at the mercy of the maps if I get 2 rounds of zeta good, if I get 2 rounds of aim arena I am probably going to get upset. I also think that seeing players really push on 1 map gives us all a chance to see how far you can take that map. The only thing I could say that has been considered is that perhaps we should force each player to pick a season long home map. Sometimes guessing what the player will choose is a bit of a chess game and some players are hoping to beat a guy on his home map. If the player suddenly changed his home map which is a smart strategy it could blow off a week of work. <br>
<br>
And finally some players simply hate some maps and forcing them to play it, they will most likely not even show up for the match. I think allowing people to play at least 1 round on a map they enjoyed is a positive thing for the highly emotionally driven 1v1 league.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This previous season I got the following tiebreak maps:<br>
<br>
Invx on Aim<br>
Fearsome on Zeta<br>
Ko-Tao on Tigcrik<br>

I'm surprised I didn't draw luke or seagull on lockdown to complete the series.<br>

If there was no choosing I would not have got to play zeta vs invx, lockdown vs ko-tao and drift vs fearsome.<br>

Map picking adds to the fun and the strategy of the map because you not only have to study the season map, you have to study the player and their choices.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, that's my point too, map picking obliges you to know your opponent well and to get used to playing different "type" of players in their best environment vice versa. And that's what I like about CAL 1v1, you really have to be good at studying your opponent, how he fights, how he thinks, how/what weapons he uses, so if you study all of this plus more that I didn't say, you WILL be able to counter his attacks and beat him on his best map, or whatever map you play against him or anyone else.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

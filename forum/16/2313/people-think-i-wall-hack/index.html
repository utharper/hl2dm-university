<br>
hey everybody...just wondering who thinks I hack and who doesn't it'd be sick to get a poll or something so I can lol myself to sleep every night.<br>
<br>
oh and since people like punk, confused, zman, blas, and so on have the "hacking" clips of me or the "hacking" demos of me I was wondering why the leader of my team and clan (Uncle Rico) doesn't have them.  Isn't it his right to review these so called hacking demos of his clan mate so he can voice his opinion as well, and deal with me in ways he sees fit?  I know Rico like the back of my HUUUUUUUUUUUUGE cock and if he reviewed these demos and decided that I was hacking he would kick me out of EE and ewR.  So please...share the hate or love with everyone <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
I'd just like the state for the record that I have never hacked and I never will...it's obvious that I don't need hacks to beat all yall. lolo1lo1l1ololo112l1olol!!<br>
<br>
seriously.<br>
<br>
peace.<br>
<br>
p.s. why wallhacks?  I would've guessed aimbots since my mag is so FUCKING amazing <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
but ok seriously...<br>
<br>
from what I've heard (which is alot) people that watch the full demos of me playing don't think that I'm hacking at all, but people that watch the clips that Seagull has put together do think that I hack...soooo quoting cheese: demos or gtfo.<br>
<br>
also, this is something that I actually take somewhat seriously.  People like confused, zman, blas, ace, etc, have these clips (and maybe demos i dunno) and have been reviewing them and watching them and voicing their opinions about whether or not i'm hacking.  First of all...this shouldn't be.  There should be a specific team of people that review my demos, along with the anti cheat admins.  Obviously the team shouldn't be biased, but not many people in the hl2dm community are fond of me anyways.  The point that I'm trying to make is that the clips/demos should be kept within the confindes (sp? maybe no d? i dunno) of the organized "demo review team."  This means that they should be mostly reviewed by the higher up anti-cheat admins (sorry Lukeyboy) but we all know that SW has gotten their hands on them already.  I don't feel that it's fair that people like ace who has the mental capacity of a mailbox have access to my "hacking demos" while people like Rico who is my clan leader and has every right to decide whether I'm hacking or not isn't "allowed" to see them.  Either keep them within a select group of non-biased people, or spread them around the community for every n00blet to watch, and since the demos have already traversed outside of the review team I urge anybody with balls to stand up and pass along this footage (maybe to people that can actually review them without bias and voice their intelligent opinions?) <br>
<br>
p.s. I would like to ask WT to refrain from locking/delete\ing this thread for awhile even if it gets a bit heated (which it may never be).  I would like to hear peoples' honest opinions about my "hacking" situation and since the thread has everything to do with me I would like to keep it up for a bit (if it gets heated I'll just lol and my rofl copter will soisoi).<br>

	<div class="content">from my personal experience, and first time in CAL, i can honestly say i believe U ALL HACK!  OMFG IT'S SOO OBVIOUS!!!<br>
<br>
not sure i've ever played ya grain, so i have no opinion.  but seriously, playing with the competetive elites has made me scratch my head a time or two and wonder how the fuck some things happen.  but then i chalk it up to map knowledge and anticipation 99.9 percent of the time.<br>
<br>
i'm just not sure any of this became public knowledge, clearly, it shouldn't have unless/until the allegation is substantiated.  then, by all means, punishment should follow along with a public announcement.<br>
<br>
and i would like to note this, my first experience in CAL has not been a pleasant one.  it's a bit difficult learning the rules and regs of the league when a few members of the community choose to pick quotes and convo's that may be out of context in an effort to twist information to suit what appears to be their own agenda.  but i'm just a CAL nub, so what do i know?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">ummmmmmmmm, ya.  poor grainy. i still love you, you'll always be my brother.  i wish i could say that grain isn't cocky,...but....um, well then i would be lying.  personally, i dont really no for sure if anybody is hacking, there are SOOO many hacks out there, that i will never know who is hacking and who isnt.  more over, what one person considers a hack and what another doesnt will always vary.  i can come in here and throw out my personal opinion like everybody else does, but in the end, just like any community, there are circles of friends and clans.  so opinions here are going to be biased.  I can stick up for grain, which i will do to my dying day, but since we wear the same tag before our names nobody is going to take me seriously, especially the people that WANT this to be true.  all i can say is EE is very different from other clans, we dont hop, the ppl you see wearing EE take them seriously. we are a VERY tight family. most of us, talk, text, email, what ever all the time, not just in game. We confide in each other over life issues, girl friends, wives, jobs, sickness, death, you pick it.  i would do anything for any EE member, i love them all like a brother.  with that being said, we also take hacking VERY seriously.  the reason i am postive that grain is not hacking isnt just because i know him, its that he wouldnt do that because he wouldnt want to let any of us down, as well as he wouldnt want to embarrase EE.  as i said, we are a very tight group, so getting kicked from EE would be like getting kicked from his family.  so when these vids come out, and trust me they will, just keep in mind that the vids you watch have been circulating for sometime.  make sure when you watch them you take into account where they have been and who has had time to alter them.  im not saying they will be altered, just keep in mind they COULD have been.  dont formulate an opinion of grain, because of rumors.  trust me, i know that he is not an easy person to get along with, he and i have had MANY a dissagreement before, BUT he really is a good person.  I have a pretty good rep in the HL2dm community as far as respectful and honesty goes(if you think otherwise please feel free to say so) and I would my rep (and my life, for that matter) on the line for him ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.  <br>

	<div class="content">I know most people here view me as someone who continually jokes and goofs around within the forums, but from time to time I can be serious and now is a good time for it.  Although I'm not that well known, I have been involved in online gaming for quite some time, going back to the beta days of CS and DoD.  I used to help a friend from work run a small CS server back when there was no penalty for cheating amounting to more than a server ban, and during that time we tested various cheats and anti-cheating programs to help keep the hacks to a minimum.  I am, and always will be a proponent of clean online gaming, whether competitive or just public play.<br>
I've seen more than a few cheaters in my experience, but I've waited until now to express my opinion over this controversy.  Over the last few days I've reviewed more than a dozen SourceTV demos of Grain playing, demos that he doesn't even know exist, many of them being 1v1's where there would be no one to communicate with.  I used <em class="text-italics">r_drawothermodels 2</em> to be able to see the models through walls.  There are many instances where I've said, "wtf? how'd he know he was there?", but in every instance, there was always something visible, or audible, that gave away a position.  You may have to crank the sound to ear-bleed level (which I know he does), but something is always there.  Whether it's a footstep or a box moving or the sound of it being slid, or a view of an enemy in the death cam after a death, it is possible to hear or see something in every instance.  In all the demos, I've found not one thing that would provide an conclusive proof of hacking.<br>
That being said, I feel as though these demos and avi's that have come to light recently are more of a personal attack than a legitimate claim of cheating.  This "evidence" is being heralded by some as 100% conclusive proof that Grain hacks, however, many people who are not CAL admins have seen these dispite countless claims that these are for CAL admin and AC admin's eyes only.  This is where opinion becomes greater than fact.  Alot of people don't like Grain, and even if he is vindicated from this, there will always be that time that his name was dragged through the mud, and there will be those that were convinced by others that he did or does cheat.  I'm sure that there's a steam conversation out there somewhere too.  Let me assure you, Seagull, I was in TeamSpeak with Grain while he was making fun of you with a false confession.  I know what he was typing while he was typing it, and it brought lulz.  GG.<br>
Here is where I stand on the matter: there has been no evidence that Grain cheats, and until I see something definitive, I will continue to defend him against these accusations.  To say that it's a private matter, and then spread the "evidence" like wildfire is nothing more than a character attack.  Admittedly, Grain is an asshole sometimes, but in recent days I've lost respect for plenty of people who I thought to be respected members of this community, included admins, advisors, instructors, etc., with their own accusations and sidestepping of questions.  This will continue to be a witchhunt by some of you after this is over and done with, and we will now always have a question mark beside a team's record at the end of this CAL season because of the ridiculous way this matter was handled.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

confused, you need to read what i wrote again.  i dont need to see them.  i dont need to see them because i trust him.  he has never lied to me in anyway shape or form.  and if such "proof" is out there, as grain said, why hasnt our clan leader seen it?  only ppl that are against him have them.  im not here to get into fights with anyone, but im entitled to speak my peace on any post here, as are you.

Did we make it clear enough? <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">  EE = family. family = trust. K? K.<br>
<br>
@ Blas:  I wasn't saying that you specifically having the demos is bad...I was just using your name as an example.  This example is referring to the fact that many people other than the CAL admins and AC admins have these demos and clips.  Also, thanks for saying im not hacking.  So far alot of people have told me after reviewing the demos that they don't think I hack...good sign? ...actually i don't care lol.<br>
<br>
@ BI:  Love you too man<br>
<br>
@ invx:  lol!  yeah i know eh, i feel so honoured! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> *rolls eyes*<br>
<br>
@ holy:  you sooooo sexy<br>
<br>
@poco:  lol the demos will "come out in time" i guess lol.  I can't wait to see them and re-live how amazing I am in every way :] <br>

oh and confused I made this thread for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1) for the lulz<br>
<br>
2) because i feel that it isn't fair that some people in the community has the demos and some don't, but they're gonna be passed around eventually so whatever.  I just thought that the leader of my clan should be able to decide whether or not his clanmate is hacking. Don't ya think? ya? ya? sweeeet.<br>
<br>
I know I don't hack and I know that Seagull is just butthurt...I don't care about people calling me a hacker.  I lol at that.  The one thing I do care about is being fair to the community which means either giving the demos to just the CAL and AC admins or giving them to everybody.  Don't try and understand me either...that's weird nig.<br>

Until then, too soon to tell. <br>
<br>
People check for potential hackers because when some people who were being suspected, ended up being caught after the same long and painful investigation and madness around it. When nothing has been found, the accused one had to go through a month of bs, shit hapens i guess.<br>

This pattern will obviously repeat itself but shouldn't be seen as a bad thing but a outine check. People shouldn't hate a person that is only suspected of cheating when until it is proved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

seagull doesn't want to release the demos because he'll just find more people seeing me as a legit player and not a hacker and seeing him as a butthurt baby.  Obviously he won't put the links up, but I urge anyone that has them to share them with the community so the assumptions and rumours and accusations will be lowered to a minimum...although what's hl2dm without assumptions, rumours, and accusations?  Oh right...that would make it a boring version of the game...<br>
<br>
lol good posts everybody, especially conflict's.<br>
<br>
I think that this whole mess with CAL playoffs put on hold and people being accused of hacking has put quite a brown skidmark on the hl2dm CAL league.  Also Edge has already stated people are getting fed up and quitting teams/CAL and maybe even hl2dm altogether, and why?  Because Seagull has yet to scrape the sand out of his cow lipped *bleeeeeeep*.<br>
<br>
Confused:  The reason there is a sense of hatred between us is because when I first heard about you/played with you, you talked like you were the toughest piece of shit in the game.  You also devoted your time to stalking Billy and posting any loss he had on the U while insulting him.  Obviously I wouldn't enjoy this behaviour since you're doing it to my teamate.  Now you and zman accused me of hacking and refused to scrim us for the longest time until you were able to see (quoting Zman) "Wha Happon?"  I think these are pretty good reasons for me not enjoy your company in this game/league.  Now, it has seemed that you've eased up on Billy and now that Zman has friended me again on steam saying that he doesn't think I hack, I'm sure you think the same.  So maybe it's time for a second chance?  Friend me if you think so.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've kept out this topic but since my name was brought up and I don't like whats going on this community, I thought of something for you Grain. Since the demos and clips have not been released and there is all this speculation, why dont you upload all your 2v2 and 4v4 demos to file front or file dropper w/e and post the links here. That way people can view for themselves your demos in there entirety using r_drawothermodels 2 and normal modes and then decide for themselves. <br>
<br>
I will say that yes I did view the demos and yes I did see some questionable things. The questionable things I saw could possibly be explained away and therefore I am not going to publicly say that I'm 100% sure of anything at this point. If you post all your demos I would be happy to view them and form a honest opinion based on what I see in its entirety, and not just base it off a few snipits of times you look very questionable.<br>
<br>
If you have nothing to hide and based on your comments so far I believe you feel you do not, post the links and let everyone see it for themselves. The things that I say I saw that were questionable was your ability to track players who are not in view and are at such a distance sometimes that I don't believe that sound could be a reason for you to be tracking. The other thing you appear to have is a super ability to do prediction nades, such as throwing one right as someone is about to come around a corner or from out of view and it lands in their face. I do know that with team comms and a real good sense of sound that can be possible, but it seems like you do it more than anyone I have ever seen.<br>
<br>
For me I have studied many demos and many players styles and techniques if a effort to improve my own play, and I have to admit that I have not seen many if any play this game the way you do. Again I at this point am not saying you are guilty, just questionable. It's possible you have some super abilities that no one else has but I would really need to see alot more of your play over a period of time to make a proper call on it. Anyway I think this could put alot of the speculation to a end and if thats what you want upload all your unaltered, unedited demos and make the links public.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
omg i'm so glad someone finally brought that up! hahaha.  I have to be cocky right here...my prediction nades pwn FACES.  That's why they're always hitting people in the face.  Predicting a nade throw is a hard thing to learn but you have to take into account the person you're playing and the area he just ran out of.  Now, some of these nades are just lucky throws, but some are just well timed.  Say for example seagull the baby runs into the back mag area in caverns and picks up the shotgun that's on the other side of the mag jail cage.  I know that he wouldn't stay in that small area for long and I also know that he can bunny hop pretty well, so I cook the nade and estimate when he'll come running out of that area and also when the nade will explode the second it passes that wall corner.  This all seems like alot of work, but to me it's common.  I'm sure other people that are good at nades are wall hacking too?  Lol, run for the hills Vox! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
oh and I guess I could upload some of my demos onto filefront, but not all of them.  I don't feel like putting up over 200 demos thank you very much <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">  Also most of these demos are being used in a frag vid that im SLOWLY making sooo I don't want to give away all my frags over this stupid hacking accusation.  That said I may put some demos up if people would like to watch me rape.<br>
<br>
Oh and p.s.  If I put up a demo of Rico and I 1v1ing, I know exactly how he plays every map soooo I'll be predicting alot of stuff on him (I have 1v1d him at least 100 times haha).<br>

I haven't seen these supposed hacking videos or demos yet so my judgement remains nutruel, but honestly an answer like that will do nothing to stick it to Seagull. If I was in your shoes I'd release my CAL demos and just end this witchhunt, if that is what it turns out to be. Some may interpret it to cowing to the skeptics to release the demos, but for me if I know I'm legit and releasing the demos proving legitness would be the ultimate uppercut knockout.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This statement has guilt written all over it and if that is your final answer to all of this, then my position is now going from thinking you are questionable to you are guilty, and obviously have something to hide.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So the only reason I suggested this to you guys was so that you could put a end to the speculation by people outside of CAL.<br>

 I personally did not want to keep having this question mark in my head based on what I had seen and thought if Grain was as clean as he says it shouldn't have been a issue at all to put up the other CAL demos for me and others to look at.

The cop at that point automatically says ok this guys has something to hide, I'll get a warrant.<br>
 See if you were the type of guy who had never even used marijuana or let anyone get in your van who did, you would say "ok go for it, look all you want I have nothing in here" But on the other hand if you had used marijuana before in your van or a friend had been smoking it in there at some point you would be a little worried to yourself thinking "hmm what could he find, I know I dont have anything on me now but maybe theres a roach under the seat or a seed here or there, I better not let him look" and thats kind of what this seems like now.<br>

 Using a frag video as a excuse is pretty weak, I heard Grain say that like over a year ago he was making one, and for that matter watching a well made frag video is something way different than sitting thru 20 min demos of game play, and should this big question mark remains as to whether or not Grains hacking whos gonna want to watch a frag video of a suspected hacker anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is a poor argument.  I would never let a cop, who asked, search my car on principal alone.  If they feel they have probable cause they need not ask.  If they do not have probable cause then it is nothing more than a witch hunt, which incidentally is what I think we have here.<br>

This is easy, if ewr has a hacker and there matches are overturned, they should  not be in the playoffs and the 9th place team does. Doing that would screw up everything if he is found to be guilty so playoffs would have to be started all over, with new seeds.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Lmao you'd have to be niave to think the CAL Anti-Cheat can stop hacking....So I have two stories I'll keep them both short. I used to have a nearly perfect magnum over a year ago before I started not sleeping well, and I was accused once at my peak of having this skill. I sent 4 demos to the accusers of the past 4 matches I played consecutively, I never heard even a whisper after that day. It's really as simple as that if theres suspicion and an accuser, releasing of demos is by the far the easiest thing to do to completely discredit and embarrass your accusers. If Seagull was wrong and you could prove it would be a huge stain to his credibility. InvX was also accused of hacking and offered to me to release all of his demos of the past 5 matches to the community and the accuser. After watching these demos I learned two things, InvX has a great magnum and stays in the shadows and stalks you until the perfect time, that whole thing about hacking...after watching the demos you'd have to be insane to say he was. I don't see how it can't be the same here, offer em up and make them look really dumb and STFU for good.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 See if you were the type of guy who had never even used marijuana or let anyone get in your van who did, you would say "ok go for it, look all you want I have nothing in here" But on the other hand if you had used marijuana before in your van or a friend had been smoking it in there at some point you would be a little worried to yourself thinking "hmm what could he find, I know I dont have anything on me now but maybe theres a roach under the seat or a seed here or there, I better not let him look" and thats kind of what this seems like now.</div></blockquote>

This is a poor argument.  I would never let a cop, who asked, search my car on principal alone.  If they feel they have probable cause they need not ask.  If they do not have probable cause then it is nothing more than a witch hunt, which incidentally is what I think we have here.<br>
<br>
And Holy is right... while seeing a few demos of grain (that he selects) may ease your mind that he doesn't hack the only thing it proves is that he wasn't hacking in those demos.</div></blockquote>
I guess you didn't see the part where in my example I said the cop says "I think I smell marijuana coming out of your van" that there is probable cause and would be totally different than the cop saying "just because you drive a van with a picture of the grateful dead on the side, I think you may have some drugs in here." which would be a search based on principal alone.<br>

The problem with this is that if the 9th team played in the playoffs they actually have a chance to win, not just take last and be happy with it. I.e. last season Seagull was the 8th place seed and won the 1v1 championship iirc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No... I saw that bit.  And if the cop felt he had probable cause and still asked if he could search my car he would get the same answer from me (whether I was guilty of it or not) on principal alone.  If he feels he has probable cause he doesn't have to ask.  If he asks he is doubting himself and then does not in fact have probable cause.<br>
<br>
The argument also breaks down because grain can not be compelled by force to allow us to search his demos.  A cop with probable cause can remove you from your car.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">the police analogy is a poor example to use.  there are any number reasons for warrantless searches where an automobile is involved.<br>
<br>
You may conduct a warrantless search of any part of a vehicle that is being used on a public thoroughfare, or which is readily capable of such use, as long as you have probable cause to believe the object you are looking for may be located in that portion of the vehicle. For example, you may search the passenger compartment, the glove compartment, under the hood, in a locked trunk compartment, or in any of the vehicle's contents, as long as what you are looking for might reasonably be located there. (Houghton (1999) 526 U.S. 295; Ross (1982) 456 U.S.798, 820-821; Acevedo (1991) 500 U.S. 565, 569-570, 580; Panah (2005) 35 Cal.4th 395, 469; Superior Court (Nasmeh) (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 85, 100-101; Carpenter (1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 365.) You do not need any additional dangerous circumstances or exigencies beyond the mobility that is inherent in any vehicle that can be operated. (Labron (1996) 518 U.S. 938, 940; Carney (1985) 471 U.S. 386, 390-391.) <br>
<br>
Note: Apart from the "automobile exception," the general "exigent circumstances" exception can also justify a warrantless vehicle search without probable cause. (Panah (2005) 35 Cal.4th 395, 469; see discussion in Ch. 3-IV-A-2.) <br>
<br>
Note: The "automobile exception" applies not only to any vehicle that is readily mobile, but also to any vehicle that reasonably appears mobile, even if in fact it is not. (Hatley (9th Cir. 1993) 999 F.2d 392, 395.)<br>
Note: As will be discussed below, the "automobile exception" likewise applies to other vehicles, including motor homes, vans, bicycles, motorcycles, and houseboats.<br>
<br>
Note: This "vehicle" or "probable cause" justification for a warrantless vehicle search is entirely separate and different from the "incident to (custodial) arrest" justification discussed under section III above, even though, in some situations, they may both exist at the same time. (Overland (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1114.)<br>
<br>
The key to understanding this "automobile exception" is to realize that it is based on "probable cause" and that "probable cause" here means exactly the same thing that it does in a search warrant context, namely, enough facts, knowledge, training, etc., to provide a "fair probability" that the object you are looking for will be found in the place (portion of the car) you want to search. (See Ch. 6, "Search Warrants"; Pinela-Hernandez (9th Cir. 2001) 262 F.3d 974, 978; Allen (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 445, 450; Nonnette (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 659, 665-666.)<br>

Jeez.<br>
<br>
Everyone has their panties in a knot over this subject and it's stupid...you say that the admins accused me of hacking in all of CAL at first, but that's wrong.  This all started because SW and mostly Seagull got all sad that there was a team out there that could give them a run for their money.  Rico and I scrimmed Seagull and Luke one night on Amp, Caverns, and LD at like 1 am.  We were tired and bored so we thought what the hell.  Rico and I played like big sacks of ass and we lost Amp and Caverns.  Then on LD we didn't want to play but we said first kill wins, and Seagull was like no, match 20 mins start.  So we started the match and I sprayed Luke to death with an smg.  Rico then started laughing and we both typed GG and left the game.  Later Luke msg'd be laughing (or...type laughing?) because he thought it was funny, but Seagull was getting all pissed at me.  For lulz I said close match in LD man <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">  And he comes back with lets 1v1 in LD and see how close it is then!  Then he starts calling me out asking for a 1v1 at like 2 am and saying if he's not the best anymore who is?  All cry baby shit like that.  I guess after that Seagull didn't like me too much and decided to use those random scrims to prove that I'm hacking, which was a fucking RETARTED idea because we lost every round lmao.  Nino was in ts a few days ago laughing his ass off while watching those demos because it was obvious how angry Seagull was at me.  In one part I killed Seagull and Luke and then Seagull sprayed me to death after spawning and sprayed my dead body lol.  He sprayed me every time he killed me and when him or I jihaded he'd type "t" because that's the default spray bind...lol...grow up maybe?<br>
<br>
Now about this whole OMG IM SCARED I DONT WANT TO RELEASE MY DEMOS thing.  I have seen that Seagull can take clips from demos that I play like shit in and make it look like I'm hacking.  He can also give them to AC admins and try and convince them that I'm hacking as well.  So if I coughed up 16 demos of myself in matches that we never lost in it'd be even easier for him to take some of my amazing kills and put them into the HACKING category.  This really is just a giant witchhunt.  I can put up some demos if you want, but I don't see what good that will do.  I could easily have not been hacking in CAL because of the anti-cheat and still beating you because ewR pwns faces.  All the demos will prove is that I don't hack in those demos...not altogether.  Even if these demos do convince people that I'm not hacking it won't convince them all and the matter will go on and on all because Seagull needs a diaper change.  Valiums, your accused thing was handled well back in the day.  Admins disputed you, and you coughed up the demos of the 4 matches to them.  The admins then reviewed the demos and decided that you weren't hacking and it was all k.  That isn't the case with this shit...So far I've had Seagull takes scrims of me losing and give them to the admins to try and prove that im hacking in CAL.  I've had admins ask for more demos which I've given to them only to have said demos given to people like ace, blas, etc... (once again just examples).  People that shouldn't have them in the first place.  Then I've had my name "tarnished" as a player, with people ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED that I'm hacking and spreading it all over the community.  We've even had the CAL playoffs put on hold for Christ's sake!  This is obviously more than a little dispute, and I'm getting sick of it.  I will put up some demo links from CAL this season if it will shut some of you cry babies up.  But seriously...HL2DM is dying...why waste your time?  <br>
<br>
Start CAL back up and finish this drama before it gets even worse.<br>

lmao.... Hey since were doing shortening our responses I'll try to keep it brief...  <br>
<br>
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br>
"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had." He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth..<br>
<br>
At any rate, Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me. I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered "Listen," a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
The fact that some of the clips seagull made showed Grain tracking players thru walls and then blowing up nades in their faces, kind of leads to probable cause in this case.</div></blockquote>

No... I saw that bit.  And if the cop felt he had probable cause and still asked if he could search my car he would get the same answer from me (whether I was guilty of it or not) on principal alone.  If he feels he has probable cause he doesn't have to ask.  If he asks he is doubting himself and then does not in fact have probable cause.<br>
<br>
The argument also breaks down because grain can not be compelled by force to allow us to search his demos.  A cop with probable cause can remove you from your car.</div></blockquote>

Why would you let him search your car. He could be corrupt just like some of the CAL admins could also be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Folowing this logic, I care not if CAL stays down or awakens right away. But since people invested time and planned their time, it would be only to be respectful and logic to let them play the damn thing.<br>

<br>
what gives a wall hacker away is there movement across the map in relation to their opponents and key behavior patterns. Its best no to jump to conclusions on wall hacking from one kill. Plus don't be surprised if in game your opponent seem to know where u are your just being predicable so look at how u play if they catch on to it the change your game play. <br>
<br>
Anyway using hacks of any sort of a way is the truest and lamest thing u can do in any game. Anyone will be pissed at hackers who wouldn't your trained so much to get to the level u are at and your being put at a big disadvantage which u can not gain back making most of those skills useless. <br>
<br>
The attitude of jumping to the conclusions that someone hacks with out fully looking into it before opening your mouth is not healthy for the community.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<strong class="text-strong">Ignored first paragraph because anyone can make up random, inaccurate guesses when they don't know anything.</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Now about this whole OMG IM SCARED I DONT WANT TO RELEASE MY DEMOS thing.  I have seen that Seagull can take clips from demos that I play like shit in and make it look like I'm hacking. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Look out guys, that's not actually Grain playing. It's someone else entirely. I'm obviously taking them out of context (There's no "leading up to the incident" or "team communications", what are those foreign concepts!)</strong><br>
<br>
He can also give them to AC admins and try and convince them that I'm hacking as well.  So if I coughed up 16 demos of myself in matches that we never lost in it'd be even easier for him to take some of my amazing kills and put them into the HACKING category.  <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I don't have a single thing to do with CAL, they aren't feeding me any demos at all. I'm getting everything from my own server that I've done scrims vs you in 2v2s. You seem afraid to post your demos here because you're scared that others will see your bullshit.</strong><br>
<br>
This really is just a giant witchhunt.  <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">THIS HAS ONLY HAPPENED TO GRAIN, RIGHT GUYS? lol</strong><br>
<br>
I can put up some demos if you want, but I don't see what good that will do.  I could easily have not been hacking in CAL because of the anti-cheat and still beating you because ewR pwns faces.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Then again you could've easily been cheating and barely winning anyway. Wouldn't surprise me based on your attitude. </strong><br>
<br>
All the demos will prove is that I don't hack in those demos...not altogether.  <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">And those demos will be just CAL and those are pretty much the only games that count.</strong><br>
<br>
Even if these demos do convince people that I'm not hacking it won't convince them all and the matter will go on and on all because Seagull needs a diaper change.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Cute, but you act like I have so much power that I can make CAL stop along with tons of other stuff. This is simply not true.</strong><br>
<br>
Valiums, your accused thing was handled well back in the day.  Admins disputed you, and you coughed up the demos of the 4 matches to them. The admins then reviewed the demos and decided that you weren't hacking and it was all k.  That isn't the case with this shit...So far I've had Seagull takes scrims of me losing and give them to the admins to try and prove that im hacking in CAL. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Yeah and this is exactly what's happening to you as well. A few weeks ago Voxtex posted the cheating dispute in IRC and it said to upload all demos. From past experience, they will also be reviewed and come to a decision. And of course I'm giving demos to the admins. Not to prove that you're specifically cheating in CAL though - just in those specific cases there's suspicious stuff and that there could also be more inside CAL, where matches actually count.</strong><br>
<br>
I've had admins ask for more demos which I've given to them only to have said demos given to people like ace, blas, etc... (once again just examples). People that shouldn't have them in the first place.  <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Err.. the admins haven't even given the demos to ME. Do you seriously think they're going to give it to those players, specifically <em class="text-italics">Ace?</em> You're delusional.</strong><br>
<br>
Then I've had my name "tarnished" as a player, with people ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED that I'm hacking and spreading it all over the community. We've even had the CAL playoffs put on hold for Christ's sake!  This is obviously more than a little dispute, and I'm getting sick of it. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">This comes with most cheating disputes</strong><br>
<br>
I will put up some demo links from CAL this season if it will shut some of you cry babies up.  But seriously...HL2DM is dying...why waste your time?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">This seriously makes you sound so ridiculously guilty. To me, it sounds like you're convinced that "HL2DM is dying" and as such want to get the most fun out of it as you can, and cheating is pretty fun imo.</strong><br>
 <br>
Start CAL back up and finish this drama before it gets even worse.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Maybe you should post your CAL demos so people can make up their own minds and put more pressure on CAL to start it back up.</strong>

<blockquote><div><cite>holymoly wrote:</cite>Hang on a second and let me recap this thread.<br>
<br>
CAL requires players to run an anti-cheat client during league matches, and Grain was running this client during a league match. But you say the client is a fallible, so Grain not having any blacklisted programs running during the match proves nothing. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">True.</strong><br>
<br>
The CAL admins have demos of Grain from the league match in question. They've been showing them to other people, who have been telling other people that Grain is clearly a hacker. These people have pretty much told the entire community that Grain is a hacker, before the CAL admins have even made a verdict. <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Completely false. The admins aren't giving out any demos.</strong><br>

<br>
LOL. This is cute. Someone finally calls out Grain on why he's asking OTHERS for demos to post instead of posting out himself and he doesn't want to because "<strong class="text-strong">people are still trying to prove me as a hacker and that will just give them more footage</strong> and possibly my steam information so they can show the shit to the higher AC admins"? So basically you don't want to post them because they might find suspicious stuff? And, of course, let's not forget his other excuse of "most of these demos are being used in a frag vid that im SLOWLY making sooo I don't want to give away all my frags". You'd think that proving yourself to the community that you don't cheat is more important than a frag video that people might not download if your reputation as a possible cheater continues, but what do I know, right?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

In my opinion, the only people that need/deserve to have these demos are the CAL admins, and these are the only people that will get them for now.

If you still feel like this post "has guilt written all over it" then that's the way it is, but I won't be "forced" into coughing up these demos just because people believe something that isn't true.

<br>
<br>
Well actually it seems to me that my argument is that you should post the demos so the community can make a decision on whether or not you're cheating in CAL, but you seem to not want to do this for bullshit reasons again and again such as <em class="text-italics">"people are still trying to prove me as a hacker and that will just give them more footage and possibly my steam information so they can show the shit to the higher AC admins"</em>, <em class="text-italics">"most of these demos are being used in a frag vid that im SLOWLY making sooo I don't want to give away all my frags"</em> and now finally <em class="text-italics">"I don't feel like wasting my time uploading 250mbs of demos to filefront so that everyone can watch me play my matches."</em>.<br>
<br>
And of course let's not forget the fact that the dispute specifically said, according to the copy/paste in IRC to "upload all demos", yet you specifically say later in #hl2dm:<br>
<br>
(9:58:21 PM) Grain: you'll get 2 wrw2 demos<br>
(9:58:24 PM) Grain: thats it<br>
<br>
And you attempt to say that you want this drama to be over with?<br>
<br>
On top of this, you then accuse them: <em class="text-italics">"obviously some of the admins have different goals"</em>. lol?<br>
<em class="text-italics"><br>
"The only thing I care about is solving this stupid thing once and for all and moving on."</em><br>
<br>
If you really cared about solving this and moving on, then the obvious thing to do would be to upload your CAL demos and let the community decide, but it seems that the community doesn't deserve them and uploading overnight is just too much of a hassle for you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't feel the need to share all my CAL demos with the community right away; not because I feel guilty, but because I don't feel like wasting my time uploading 250mbs of demos to filefront so that everyone can watch me play my matches.  I have given the demos to the CAL admins and I had to use Paradox's ftp and account to upload the file since CAL wouldn't allow something so big.  In my opinion, the only people that need/deserve to have these demos are the CAL admins, and these are the only people that will get them for now.  Once this whole thing is over I will gladly put up some demos if the community still wants them, but for now this situation is between the CAL admins and I (and ewR).  If you still feel like this post "has guilt written all over it" then that's the way it is, but I won't be "forced" into coughing up these demos just because people believe something that isn't true.  If you think I'm guilty then fine, if you don't that's also fine, I don't really care.  The only thing I care about is solving this stupid thing once and for all and moving on.</div></blockquote>

Your sorta contradicting yourself over and over.<br>
<br>
You want to solve the problem yet you dont want to upload demos, but you kinda do, but dont want to, and kinda do, and you dont care that much and shit....awww man</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok.   Grain has a right not to make his demos public.  He is correct in that at this point it is between him and the CAL admins.  He was asked for the demos again by the CAL admins and he has provided them once secure a means to do so was given to him.   I offered my FTP as a secure place for him to upload them since the CAL site wouldnt accept them.  No one besides CAL officials will be given access to the files on my FTP.  The only ones with access info at this time are Grain, me and a couple of CAL officials.  Its a rather complex password and it will be changed as soon as everyone that has to have the demos has them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well actually it seems to me that my argument is that you should post the demos so the community can make a decision on whether or not you're cheating in CAL, but you seem to not want to do this for bullshit reasons again and again such as <em class="text-italics">"people are still trying to prove me as a hacker and that will just give them more footage and possibly my steam information so they can show the shit to the higher AC admins"</em>, <em class="text-italics">"most of these demos are being used in a frag vid that im SLOWLY making sooo I don't want to give away all my frags"</em> and now finally <em class="text-italics">"I don't feel like wasting my time uploading 250mbs of demos to filefront so that everyone can watch me play my matches."</em>.      </div></blockquote>

<br>
If you really cared about solving this and moving on, then the obvious thing to do would be to upload your CAL demos and let the community decide, but it seems that the community doesn't deserve them and uploading overnight is just too much of a hassle for you.</div></blockquote>

95% of the people that initially sided with you have come forward now and apologized to Grain after seeing the full demos as opposed to your .avi's.  Apparently there's a 5% margin for stupidity and/or poor vision.  The CAL match demos are in the hands of those that need them at this point, if Grain wants to release them after this is over I'm sure he will.  What Grain doesn't want is for someone like you to take his demos, tear them apart, make avi's and try to convince people that something 'suspicious' is going on like you've already done.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

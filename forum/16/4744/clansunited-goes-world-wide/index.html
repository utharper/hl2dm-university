	<div class="content">hey guys.<br>
<br>
911 asked in our forums if they could play at cu as there are no more north american leagues for hl2dm. we are happy if new clans would join us, still we see the reasons why it can be hard to play in europe servers and follow "europe rules" for example for americans. so the idea came that cu could host a north american league. maybe we can change rules for this league with ff off and us-servers for example. cu could offer the forums and the place to post wars etc.<br>
what i want to know now, is, if this is worth to be started (means are enough teams there to start an own league for americans, australians etc)<br>
<br>
if you have a team and are willing to play in a league then add my with my profile:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/koncentrate" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/id/koncentrate</a><br>
<br>
hope we can start this.<br>

SpD is down with this. We all still want to play competively. CU coming to the US would be a great thing to pick up where Warzone left off. I also think that all the North American Clans should talk more on the config settings such as friendly fire being turned off, this seems to be an open discussion because some of the players are more open to try a different kind of competition.<br>

this<br>
<br>
most of the cu-rules would also count for you, such as "no flaming in cu-forums etc" (what will be hard enough for you guys), but if you get a decent amount of teams then an own division for you is no problem and then we dont mind what server you play on. today i will open a topic in our board where teams can register theirselves.<br>
what we need then is:<br>
- teamname / teamtag<br>
- link to cu-profiles of all players in a team<br>
- all profiles must include the STEAM_ID in the right format (STEAM_0:0:100)<br>
- all players must have the teamname in their cu-nickname<br>
- i need a homemap, (for now you can choose a homemap from the cu-mappool, if you want maps to be added, talk to me in private) <br>
- name a leader and a co-leader<br>
- additional info like homepage or something<br>
<br>
link to board will come soon<br>

Maybe I'll get punched at for answering but. You're not only getting forums, you get the match system too. A report function where the winning team sends in screens and scores. this then get transfered to the data base and added to the tables etc. You will also get a head admin that isn't in your league. That will make sure everything works fair for each team. Make sure teams behave etc.<br>
<br>
Not the head of a clan that makes sure his map is the map played in the finals etc ;D</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Non biased admins...database for reporting wins/losses screens, non biased map selection (you choose the map you want for the season). Really nothing to lose....just working with warrior to add U.S. maps, making sure friendly fire is off and the like.

It's thought of a 2v2 or 3v3 league for americans inside of cu (Depending on interest). That map list is for 3v3. Altough Silver and Valiums is figuring out a new maplist for the american league. Adding/removing maps. <br>
<br>
The roster is at no limit except that it can't be fewer players than required in the actual league. Ie: Not less than two in 2v2 and not less than three in 3v3. Note taht one player can only be in one team per league.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Add Warrior or myself if you have any maps you'd like to be available for your hometeam map selection (unless your going to be ridiculous and suggest de_walmart or a killbox map), though most if not all maps that U.S. players already play for 2v2 and 3v3 will be available in the map pool later soon enough, from amp to zeta.<br>

To clearify. You can play for SW in 2v2 and 3v3 for flaS. It's okay as long as you're not in SW and flaS in the same league. This is how we do in the euro league. Dunno how it will be though for the american.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

When it starts is on us, the quicker we sign up a sufficient amount of teams the quicker we can start it all. Americans will not be playing Europeans, we have our own division.

I think that a team should be able to choose any map as their home map so long as it doesn't have any gimmicks like instant kill buttons, isn't even for both teams, isn't a 1 weapon map, and isn't a true killbox. Size of a map can have problems, but to me it is still even for both sides. I've always preferred the format of teams having a home map instead of playing a different map each week.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

LOL it was just like CAL!!!!<br>
<br>
Seriously though, it might make it more interesting if teams have home maps.  Also, as stated above, less bitching with weekly map choices.  Having to play the same map all the time though, might get boring (?).   Is it possible for a team to have 2 or more maps they can choose from?   I havent had time to read the site yet but is a match determined by total points or round wins?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think you guys could do this and since it a league for you and not EU. My judgement is it work out for you guys because you play a range of maps and as said it might get boring for you. Reason why it was not done for EU is that everyone was used to having a fixed map and tbh the players in EU are very limited on what maps they play so having fix maps allowed them to train a particular map for a up coming game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

winning a match works this way:<br>
<br>
you get <br>
- 1 point for playing<br>
- 1 point for each map win<br>
- 1 point for winning overall by frags<br>
<br>
the 1 point for playing should be only seen as a punishment for those teams who doesnt show off for a match<br>
<br>
you win both maps: 4 points<br>
you win 1 map/lose 1 map and win whole match by frags: 3 points<br>
you win one map but lose by frags: 2 points<br>
you lose both maps and also (ofc) by frags: 1 point<br>
no show: 0 points<br>
<br>
thats it.<br>

also i think its not good to have more then 1 homemap. atm seasons are 5 weeks long (6 teams per division) and thats not such a long time that a map gets boring. you can change your homemap mid-season <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">imo there are some different things in cu from what u guys are used to. first is the homemap thing. you have to play a homemap for a whole season, means you can train that one (due to the fact seasons are short it wont get boring). also there is no us-admin for managing this league, so he wont be corrupt or something with what u had problems in the past. cu 3v3 is now running in the 13th season and 2v2 is running in the 7th season. and that with 24teams in 3v3 and 18 teams in 2v2 in a game where everyone is crying that its already dead <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> so you see, cu is pretty successful until now, and euros are mainly very excited that us-guys are joining with their own league<br>
<br>
about scheduling a match. every team has to arrange their wars in the cu-forum with time and date, also the team that starts the topic, should be in this format:<br>
<strong class="text-strong">title: S01W01: $W vs nS</strong><br>
also in the text should be a date and time suggestion, only "hey when can u play" doesnt count as an effort to play the match <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
if there are still rules questions, feel free to ask here or even better in cu-forums.<br>
<br>
@paradox:<br>
i only know you from reading your posts here in the u, and i dont want to argue with u, but most of the posts from you here in this thread are pessimistic. dont think this helps a bit to get this running successful <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> maybe u can trust us that we know our business. if it fails, then feel free to say: "i knew it"<br>

Maybe I'll get punched at for answering but. You're not only getting forums, you get the match system too. A report function where the winning team sends in screens and scores. this then get transfered to the data base and added to the tables etc. <strong class="text-strong">You will also get a head admin that isn't in your league</strong>.

	<div class="content">I want to clear some BS up. CAL did not die because of corrupt HL2DM admins or lack of participation. Everyone saying that is just bitter or sorely misinformed. CAL ran season after season and I whom actually kept any track of player participation never saw a significant change every season it was pretty much the same no matter what rules were in place, who was the admin or what maps were played. CAL died because the owner of CAL and the CPL was an asshat who blew all the money on himself and eventually needed to sell it because the organization was insolvent, during the sale of CPL/CAL he did not deliver the back end and website files and code for anti cheat to the Arab firm that purchased it. So they had no website to get going which they had planned to do. Then the Arab firm filed a law suit eventually it was sold to a Chinese firm who still does not have the needed files. Many people held out hoping things would be resolved but nothing ever came of it, basically it was completely out of the control of anyone in any position in CAL or the CPL except Angel Munoz. <br>
<br>
As for Dallas I can not comment. But I have never seen any league in HL2DM that was without accusation of corrupt admins and that certainly includes CU. The fact is no matter what you do some people will never be happy. I do notice though the same people who are unhappy in one league tend to be unhappy in another even when run by completely different admins. <br>
<br>
As for map picking once again that was all tried. The problem with teams picking 2 maps and breaking a tie by frags is simple no team with any chance of winning will pick certain maps even if they love it because this system rewards teams for playing maps with more scoring. There is no fair way to break a tie if 2 different maps are played especially in HL2DM. You just pick and get good at a small map with tons of spawn kills because then each time it comes to a tie you are more likely to win. Anyhow pick your maps carefully people it will be the difference of winning or losing in lots of matches since if 2 teams are close they are likely. And for choosing maps once again if it is to be completely unbias people mist be allowed to pick any map they want no matter what. But to keep the quality of the league in check you need to rule out maps and then bias comes in, after all it is just map bias that decides that a killbox is less worthy than any other map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Some people gotta relax, no one around here besides Da11aS was offering to run an entire league for us and it didnt workout for various reasons. If someone who was proven to be unbiased actually tried to startup a league for us we could've seen the same interest we have for CU because of the influx of new players...but it hasn't happened and until then CU is offering to host and run everything free of charge and free of ass kissing to make things happen and they seem to do it well.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is something i remember discussing with some euro players some time ago, mainly the part about whoever chooses a high frag map like bio is almost always going to win a tiebreak against someone choosing powerhouse or some other map where you can camp/hide/run even if losing and end with very few deaths. It seems odd that this setup is still used (the discussion was years ago iirc).<br>
<br>
Also its not hard to remove bias in ruling out maps, just have a league wide set of simple but sensible stipulations on what constitutes a competition grade map that goes into effect before the season starts. Ie, no major bugs or defects, made for stock settings, not a killbox (insert killbox definition here), etc.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No, a 5+ layer inverted ziggurat of admins, most of whom dont play the game or even know how it works, is perfect. Nothing like having to grind through nearly every layer over a 2 month period to get a final cheat dispute verdict of "were fucking clueless".<br>

The divisions will be based on skill, through my own personal experience and suggestions from team leaders and various players we have the divisions set. Division 1 3v3; em0, $W, LsD, Xs, Synergy, 911. <br>
<br>
Division 2; nS, nX, Elite, team L, spD.<br>
Winner of Division 2 will move up to Division 1 in place of the lowest scorer of division 1. Sorry if I offended anyone with the placements but through experience and advice from many this seems to be the best structure.<br>
<br>
2v2 will have identicle structure except there are 6 teams for both division 1 and division 2, with synergy having an A team in division 1, and a B team in division 2.<br>
<br>
EDIT :: EE still has the chance to sign up if they want to, I just need you guys to sign up within a few days however. Also it would be good to know if PB and Nutri will play for you guys, in that case LsD will be moved to division 2 and EE will place in division 1 for 3v3.<br>

im not 100% sure but imo RaWR stands for RaW Runoff, they have a very active runoff only server and afaik the RaWR players are the ones playing on that server most. maybe snd can say somethign abbout that <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Clans-United NA will definately without a doubt continue. As to whether there will be two divisions thats completely up to you guys. I had almost predicted that 911 and spD would be gone at the end of the season before it started, I gave spD some slack room to try and fly straight but they didnt do it. 911 had alot of members but only 2 out of the 10-12 members were only active. I was surprised at SynGold leaving, hopefully they make a return if they find some more members.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fact is we need more clans for two divisions, IMO we dont have enough. As it stands one division, longer season is looking likely. We have a bunch of "maybe's" or "possibly's" about committals to next season, if all the maybe's were to join/rejoin next season we will have two divisions. <br>
<br>
<br>
Long story short, two divisions for next season? Need a few more clans, need people to stop immaturity and stick with a clan if its gonna happen...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What in the sam hell are you talking about, the scene is not dead? Division 1 had 19 matches played alone in a span of four weeks only, Syngold is likely returning along with 911 next season. <br>
<br>
We have MORE then enough for division 1, too many teams actually if we try to consolidate the league into one division if 911 and Syn return to div 1, thats my problem, we need a few more for Division 2 to live....To call the scene dead is ridiculous as we're looking at the CU playoffs/championship match starting next week. Your idea is pretty cool and radical, but Division 1 is still extremely active, and will continue to be active to the point the need for this system is completely not needed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Some way should be devised to run it more like a ladder or alter the division format so everyone is sort of lumped together but based on skill you tend to play teams that are more near you skill level. Usually ladders achieve this. Then it does not matter what number of teams play they always get games and more or less they are as close to their skill level as the limited number of teams allows.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">One division is all thats needed. Put everyone in that one division and after each weeks matches are complete, simply set winners to face winners, using rpi or elo or whatever ranking system cu has to determine which winners play which (im assuming it has something to track quality of match outcomes), do the same for losers and youll have roughly equally skilled players versing eachother during every week except the first (and the equality will increase as the season progresses).<br>
<br>
This system also functions better (fewer lopsided matches) as the player count increases, so cramming everyone into a single division becomes a good thing instead of a problem.<br>
<br>
The only potential issue is that there can end up being quite a few repeat matches between players of similar ratio/ranks, but its hard to see this as an actual downside as these players will also generally be evenly matched.<br>

Then, they'd probably improve after playing with such a variety of players as this could present (if it can catch on).  You could have a judge (or judges) that make the decision of whether or not someone is too good to play in the draft league or whatever it be called.<br>
<br>
We (the top players) have CU, even if there aren't many of us left, all we do is play each other over &amp; over anyway right?  No reason to change it now to raping average people in a draft thing.<br>
<br>
I talked to impala about it and he wants top players to be in the draft league because we show people what real tdm is like.  I agree with this, you don't get better unless you play better people, but I find that attitude rare in this game anymore.  And, quite honestly, I don't care anymore about people improving; I just want one bigger, consolidated community ffs, not a bunch of little split up ones.<br>

Word.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just as simple as someone stepping up and being the organizer/leader for it. Me? I'll pass on trying to run CU and a draft night, but I would love to see Sunday night drafts again.<br>
<br>
BTW....I having my last two exams this week, and one on Wednesday, therefore the final deadline of this Wednesday to get ALL of your matches, I.E. missing matches and your final Week 5 matches is now Thursday. I'd like to hold the CU playoffs on Sunday, then our championship matches of Div 1 and Div 2 next Sunday at different times so people can spec both matches. Then we break for a little bit.<br>
<br>
<br>
One last thing I will consider the ladder concept, most likely hold a vote on it during the CU break.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What happen to the Div 2?<br>
<br>
Ladder system still has its flaws.  I would think if the div 2 team are evenly matched it would be a better draw to play for the Div 2 championships! rather then the 8th spot on the ladder</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Nothing happened to Div2 yet....though it might need to be scrapped next season because teams cant hold together and beside the fact clan lttl IMO is completely ready for division 1 play now, but I guess they get to prove that in the championship.<br>
<br>
Only possibility of draft happening is draft night, which I can help out with but I wont be the head guy to do it, there will be no draft in CU next season. For ladder though yeah, pretty controversial for some, I'll hold a vote on it during our break.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Honestly, the system works as it is IF we can get enough teams to participate for 2 divisions.  Personally I wouldnt fuck with it and introduce a ladder at this point.  Ladders have their issues as well and IMO you need many more <span style="text-decoration:underline">active</span> teams for a ladder to work, like 20 or more at the very least.  The point is, the game NEEDS more clans/teams.  No league is going to work effectively or be interesting with 6-8 clans/teams active, just wont happen.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

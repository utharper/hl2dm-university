&lt;niniojmaon&gt; yo<br>
&lt;PwnageTV|CptHowdy&gt; ?<br>
&lt;niniojmaon&gt; Hey, i was wondering if coverage of cal league went to any 'other' games<br>
&lt;niniojmaon&gt; i enjoyed your dods coverage<br>
&lt;niniojmaon&gt; i didn't see any info on how to get covereage or if you only do the set games<br>
&lt;niniojmaon&gt; hl2dm is getting ready to start playoffs in cal for 1v1,2v2, and 4v4<br>
&lt;PwnageTV|CptHowdy&gt; you can post in our forum about it, but to be honest we havent had alot of luck find good staff to cover this game type, and we havent recieved alot of support from the community in the pass when we have done it<br>
&lt;niniojmaon&gt; ah ok<br>
&lt;niniojmaon&gt; well i saw you could apply for caster somehow?  I guess i should take this to the forums.  Thanks for the info<br>
&lt;PwnageTV|CptHowdy&gt; np
</div></blockquote>

<br>
I think he was refering to the dods castings that went ok for a while, but then dods switched to a different cast system.  So there may be other options out there.  if we were to make this happen would would need some casters to apply and would need 10 people that would register on the pwn.tv forums and request cal-playoff coverage.  I think 1v1 would be a great way to showcase the game.... Maybe 2v2.  <br>
<br>
So I would be down to help.<br>
would you?<br>
I may make a steam group to make it happen.  But i need some one else to really wanna see it happen and give it a try.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Because of the amount of crashing I've heard about besides my match tonight in draft league, I am curious whether you guys would like to see the pause option implemented for <span style="font-size:150%;line-height:116%">CRASH</span> purposes only.

What? The pause option would be for ONLY crash purposes only. Any other use would have your clan DQ'ed from the round.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I expect it to be a close poll, I'm sure if the poll passes in favor of pause and it shows itself to be a failure after season 1 I will make the motion in an eFPS admin vote to remove it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
lawl the pausing option would never go that far. I mean when my powerline falls into a sinkhole thats a diff story.<br>
<br>
Something along the lines of the team must confirm the player has crashed then officially say "Player X has crashed, please pause the game". That way if its abused in anyway and a team disputes pause abuse all we have to do is look at the sourceTV demo (which are available to the public every week) and see that he really crashed or didnt crash. I would say a maximum of 1-2 minutes before the admin must resume the match, if hes not back by then tough luck.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

sv_timeout, change that from like 65 to like 5, cause seriously i dont see the point in that. But also would fix that situation as they would be kicked from the server allmost immediatly after crashing/timing out. Otherwise u have to wait a whole minute (steam id still in use on this server).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

That is rare, unlike crashing or timing out. In any case u could type "retry" in console. And if someone pauses for 5 seconds that deserves a pause imo.<br>
I dont know about u guys but i am allways timing out, and everytime i have to wait literally a minute b4 i can rejoin same server, surely it isnt just me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I know it is not fair but it never will be, when you crash you may lose control of the map, lose the weapons, lose timing and no amount of pause is going to give that back to you. When you respawn you may be spawn killed multiple times. <br>
<br>
Yes it happens as do alot of other unfair things in this game if you are good overall your record will reflect it. If you crash more than other people you need to address your computer or internet connection the best you can rather then making it a burden on everyone else. <br>
<br>
If we are going to waste extra time I would rather we just play another match to even things out a third round to tie break would be a funner use of time. It is highly unlikely that the same team would be at the losing end of 2 crashes in 1 match. If they are they need to fix their problems.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hummmmm strong words about time wasting when the last match you played we waitied on you for an extra half hour past the agreed upon time for your cooldown match. quti preaching what you don't practice, then again your known for doing alot of that. Also couple more days guys to vote! Looks as if it may pass, IMO one season of just testing it out wont hurt anyone.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I was always perplexed why you guys never used pause in a scrim match considering how buggy this game is and what a big difference it can make to the outcome of the game when you playing a man short. Now I do understand people thinking that a team could abuse it but that only if you don't have rules governing the use of the tool. Simple rules like how long a pause can be in place and what circumstances it can be use would keep it in order and if a team dicks around with it you got rules to punish them with. <br>
<br>
I don't think I have ever had a issue with it in a game only thing I got against it is if your team is playing really well and a pause happens it can be a very annoying and throw you off your streak. As with anything you got to adapt to it and don't make excuses and just focus on being better since it goes both ways.<br>
<br>
As for 1v1 in my past scrims the other player always pauses if I crash since the rule state it should be used by the player still in the game until the player returns or pause time has expired. It all about sportsmanship.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I fail to see how a tiebreaker round is more fair. Look through the summer cup and CU matches, all matches have been won by razer slim margins. Guess who wins in tiebreaker rounds? The ones who get rebels, and how do we decide who gets rebels? After doing a 4 hour marathon against $W in STA when wins were counted by who won the round and not by score it became apparent how flawed it is, we did 4 overtime rounds, the first three were won by whoever had rebels.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Not sure about your math but i'm pretty sure 5 minutes for a pause is shorter then 20 minutes for a third round.   When we used pro, the pause option was great.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think it's more than time to erase the line that has been separating killboxers and DMers.<br>
<br>
Too many players has been playing, days after days, years after years, a game they're good at it. HL2DM. But they've been looked upon by "the mass" who decided how is the game meant to be played. <br>
<br>
Killboxes and Deathmatches are like days and night and yet it's the same game.<br>
<br>
I want killboxers, and killbox mappers, and killbox servers to feel a breath of fresh air.<br>
<br>
Getting more player to visit the U by giving the league a forum section would attract alot of players here, new friendships, new alliances, new challenges, new horizons, new maps, sharing knowledges...<br>
<br>
Too many clans and players forgotten, with no way to rise. It's time to unite and accept the game as a whole.<br>
<br>
I dream of seeing a beanbot server running dm_lostarena because they got to know all of us a bit more and they want to experiment, and then seeing [server you're used to play on] running a killbox!<br>
<br>
Killbox name has also been ruined by the way people remember it. IMO kbh_b2 isn't "Teh killbox zomg" there's tons of really well worked, balanced, good looking, nice FPS, enjoyable killboxes to play out there, that no one knows about.<br>
<br>
I want clans like XS {rAc} thc* [KBH] TSGK and much more, to get what they deserve.<br>
<br>
Your opinion count alot. Please discuss.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 Since it seems killboxes are more prevalent than regular maps these days it only makes sense to unite at the U.<br>

ya, the reason the community is as big as it is right now is because of killbox players. <br>
It is also a good way for players to start the game or just chill out and shot some guns. I know i quti and didn't intend on coming back.  But after pubbing tsgk a few times and it always being full got me back into the game, at least having fun pubbing again.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd like to see some killmaps instead of just boxes, maybe like what punk said, but just open it up a bit and use jump-pads and teleports keep flow even though that map is massive.  <br>
<br>
I have been playing on getting a few killbox maps on 'the war room' server, right after i clean up all the crappie maps from the old days.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yea forum section would be a must.<br>
<br>
Clans that has been contacted so far last night are:<br>
<br>
&lt;bean-bot&gt; MaX IWU lWARl gotg gdawwg EYE TD:<br>
<br>
message has been spammed in all the eastern/central killbox servers around 23h and I plan on doing it some more.<br>
<br>
Now for the forum section, we could split a killbox section into "match settings discussions" and "suggest maps" or something so everyone can express themselves with the map/gravity for matches.<br>
<br>
expect alot of new registrated users this week, I hope <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't want to promote and get people excited about something that does not yet exist. Fearsome is offering the chance for the killbox community to have a division in CAL. If it is not handled correctly, it wont happen. First step is not bringing in all the killbox clans, it is getting admins who are mature enough and committed to run it. Then once the league is a reality, we would want to promote it like crazy to bring in the players.<br>
<br>
The reference to learning from our mistakes is intended for those who were involved in CAL when the ctf division was started, and they all know exactly what I am taking about (on both sides of the fence btw). <br>
<br>
Me saying that CAL would need admins that the wider killbox community respects is a legitimate concern. If the wrong people take the job, the league will be dead before it begins.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I think that I have heard or read somewhere that KBH and TSGK have "no league play" policies in place that would prevent them from participating, although I do not know for certain. Maybe someone from those clans could clarify for us.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well ive been killboxing for like 3 years now. <br>
<br>
From my own exp. I can say that there is only one map that plays decently (1v1 only), and that is kbh_2. <br>
And maybe add aim_arena.<br>
<br>
As far as the league goes it should be a 1v1 layout, no killbox imo is suitable for 2v2(or higher). If cals gonna be running it, it would make sense to just use the CAL config. Maybe make a revised version of kbh_2 for cal to fix the sv_pure error from the textures. dm_killbox_kbh_2_cal (I am sure keeper is aware of what i am talking about.)<br>
<br>
I don't think it would be wise if it contains low grav, as it would eliminate any chances for advancement movement.<br>
<br>
As far as admining the league, I do not know what responsibilities it includes, so if someone could clarify via pm or here it would be nice.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

1) There really hasn't been any.<br>
2) Most of us are really not competitive.<br>

i think clans like EYE (this i know lol), KBH, OFC, TSGK, MAX, etc will most definitely be serious about such a league.</div></blockquote>

I don't want to promote and get people excited about something that does not yet exist. Fearsome is offering the chance for the killbox community to have a division in CAL. If it is not handled correctly, it wont happen. First step is not bringing in all the killbox clans, it is getting admins who are mature enough and committed to run it. Then once the league is a reality, we would want to promote it like crazy to bring in the players.<br>
<br>
The reference to learning from our mistakes is intended for those who were involved in CAL when the ctf division was started, and they all know exactly what I am taking about (on both sides of the fence btw). <br>
<br>
Me saying that CAL would need admins that the wider killbox community respects is a legitimate concern. If the wrong people take the job, the league will be dead before it begins.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I think that I have heard or read somewhere that KBH and TSGK have "no league play" policies in place that would prevent them from participating, although I do not know for certain. Maybe someone from those clans could clarify for us.</div></blockquote>

i should have been clearer WT. i have no doubt yours and fearsome's intentions and concerns are legitimate. what i'm saying is many people including myself are not aware of past experiences and kind of read that post as a bit of "well you better behave yourselves or else.." and basically don't really know what it's about.<br>
 ...now that "history" has been explained it makes much more sense  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation"> <br>
so all in good will eh. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> <br>
<br>
on the same note. i do agree with snipe and keeper that regular KBs are only good for 1vs1 - we might want to extend this league to more than regular killboxes. <br>
aim arena is not a killbox. i think we should brainstorm this a bit more. there are arena maps and more complex KBs out there. they might fit in here very nicely allowing for more than 1vs1 matches to happen.<br>
<br>
your thoughts...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The reason for comments is because at one time I forced Ko Tao to put a killbox into the CAL 1v1. The idea was to get killbox players to play as they complained their was no killbox and that was why they did not play. Some people went around and spammed various killbox clan sites and server to get them to join. That I know of not 1 player joined, if one did it never played a match. Various complaints from regular grav to whatever came in. Killbox was then removed from the league. <br>
I do not think TSGk will join contrary to you, their leader has made comments that no TSGK member is allowed to compete and they claim to be a strictly non competitive clan. He also has done various things in opposition to HL2DM U. It seems he wants nothing to do with the U or leagues and for unknown reasons. OFC is another doubtful. I don't really consider them a killbox clan and the few members that do compete have to join other teams to do so. They have rampant paranoia that I and others cheat. <br>
While only time will tell, to me 50% of the definite interest you list is a very long shot in the dark. Im not sure you understand the killbox community, or perhaps it is I who does not understand. <br>
<br>
Anyhow my offer stands unlike the team play leagues I completely wash my hands of any influence I will only provide access the the suite of league tools CAL has. The killbox admins can run it all any way they please, high grav low grav whatever. And we will really see if the killbox community is just missing the settings they need or they simply have no interest in playing each other or anyone else.

What Joe had issues with is members scheduling clan matches.  With our history that has never ended well.<br>

But where TSGK has the policy that you can't use the tag in league play, KBH does not.  In fact there are some TSGK members in CAL.  They either have a different name, or just drop the tag.<br>

So, yes, we are in favor of it as far as individual members playing, but I don't think you'd see a clan poster from TSGK for any map udpates <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

It seems the leaders of 2 of the bigger organizations in the game would want to be part of probably the biggest organization in the game to help. <br>

I know it was tried before but what may have been a turnoff to these guys last time was the potential to have to play a regular map and at stock settings. If they all knew it was gonna be a killbox only type map and possibly 400 grav, they might think differently about it this time. Another thing to keep in mind is that just like anything the first time you start it, its gonna take some time to gain momentum and popularity as well as work out kinks or problems with it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm up for a Killbox League...<br>
<br>
Because of my disability I'm limited on my playing movements, and I find that killboxes are the only types of maps im decent at. Plus, I do map designing and things for the STK clan, and I'd be willing to design a couple of maps.<br>
<br>
If this comes to life, are there going to be any limits on what is &amp; isn't allowed? I only ask for the sake of reflecting back on my disability. Because I can only use one or two fingers on my right hand, I have a mouse and I have a jump+duck bind key that I use. Thats the only thing that I see that might limit me is if I was not not allowed to use this.<br>

	<div class="content">We generally run only Killbox maps on our servers, but sometimes will switch it up. I think some of our members may be interested in this league, but I can see some reasons why they would be hesitant. First, a Killbox environment has a more open free for all feel to begin with. When you start editing maps to make them more "teamplay" friendly, you end up with a a completely different atmosphere. If a league is going to be set up, it has to be run by people who enjoy Killbox maps, and that style of play. I know its been mentioned a few times that almost all killbox maps are only suitable for 1 vs. 1, but yet many clans run team deathmatch servers with Killbox maps. The 1 vs. 1 is a non issue for us, because the faults you guys may see in a map are something we learn to overcome.<br>
<br>
I think a Killbox League is a grand idea, but too many rules, and regulations, or changes in maps will get rid of that free for all Killbox feel. Thats just my $.02.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I would like to see it go 2v2 personally. Easier to schedule than 3v3 and up, one 1v1 division is sufficient IMO. I also see no reason not to include low gravity as an option, we have three other divisions running at stock.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

we should move this forward, we don't need to get clan admins behind anything. here is what i suggest we do :<br>
<br>
two things..<br>
<br>
1) Create a forum section dedicated to the Killbox League. it will serve two purposes:<br>
A. Provide a place for people to sign up for the KBLeague.<br>
B. Host discussions related to KBLeague<br>
<br>
2) Have the U officals discuss and decide what maps are played, rules, etc. - why? simple:<br>
Let people make these decisions and it will all go down in flames in two minutes. people love to argue and this thread is vivid proof. The University ALREADY has a board of officials and within the board there are people who play and know Killboxes and what Killboxes  are about. a slightly different approach than stock style maps is required here.<br>
<br>
I run a very busy life but i will devote all my online time to help this come alive. Let's start moving the KBLeague forward. CAL is not being run by major clans admins and so this league should not be waiting for those ghosts to apear so let's just forget about them.<br>
<br>
This post was written with the intention to move this thing forward in mind - not to argue with anyone or anything so please read it this way <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Good luck with your project. I'm sure many in TSGK will be interested in it.<br>
<br>
I was sent this link from a member who was surprised that TSGK had a policy about not allowing members to join. Firstly, only a TSGK member can really state for certain what rules apply to our team. Some of the contributors are at best misinformed about our policy while others have been more accurate.<br>
<br>
We do not have any problem with members playing in any league. However, they can not wear the TSGK tag. There are many leagues and competitions and it's only prudent that the team's management validate ones we're officially involved with. There are many we're not involved with, quite often simply due to time constraints. Again, any member can enter anything they want, and good luck to them. That's official.<br>
<br>
I don't know why some follks are adding 1 and 1 together and getting 3. Again, they could just be misinformed. I don't know to be honest as I don't know them, perhaps they use a different name ingame. This is the first I've heard about this league. I'm not aware of us being asked about it. We have a forum also, and I don't recall mention of it there. I think this thread was throwing an idea out before taking any actions so that probably explains it. As for Osiris having a problem with HL2DMU... Woahh! Where'd that come from? - not him I bet! This is very far from the truth as I think a lot of you would know. <br>
<br>
Anyway - best of luck to the project. And nice forum - keep up the great work.<br>

I tought I mostly pointed out how uniting together would make an actual league happen, I'm not ''mostly playing killboxes now'', I won't be admining this league if it happens as I retire myself from being an ''Instructor'' as well. <br>
<br>
I hoped to make what I tought was the right choice for the community of HL2DM, maybe in a wrong way (my bad?) Hopefully people didn't took it the wrong way and knew my true intentions. The link has been done, the word has spread around, now people will have to interact with each other in a cooperative way (wich is probably the rarest thing to happen over internet) and I wish it works out in the end.<br>

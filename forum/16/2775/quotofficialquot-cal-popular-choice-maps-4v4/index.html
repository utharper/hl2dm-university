Milieu is a preseason map because it is new.  The same thing with dm_lockdown_r5.  It gives people a chance to play it once before they have to play it officially.   It took dm_cannon's place, would you rather play that, I wouldn't?<br>

There are 8 weeks of regular season, so 8 maps, 8 weeks, no repeats during those weeks.  The semifinals and finals have not been posted yet.<br>

<br>
I thought preseason was to weed out the crap teams? So really people will not get a chance to play since preseason is for forfeits.....<br>
<br>
Fearsome always wanted to do this 4 maps by public and 4 by admins deal.   <br>
<br>
dm_carverns<br>
dm_lostvillage<br>
dm_zeta<br>
dm_lockdown<br>
<br>
then by admins<br>
<br>
dm_amplitude<br>
dm_milieu<br>
<br>
and the crap left over<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Well I don't know what preseason was originally intended for, but I see that it can have several purposes<br>
<br>
To weed out BS teams.  I wish I was a mind reader and could know which teams will play and which won't and get them out ahead of time.  I also wish we had locked main to only teams that had played before to avoid the problem with that division.<br>
<br>
To introduce new maps so that people can try them<br>
To get new people used to having to take ss and demos and getting the whole bloody procedure down<br>
<br>
To allow the not so new <br>
 teams to refamiliarize themselves with the bloody procedure<br>
<br>
To make sure the damn buggy CAL site is working <br>
<br>
I can't speak to how the vote factored (or not) into the map list.  I can only speculate because it was pretty much out of my hands.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The voting was partially ignored in 1v1 as well- feudal got more votes than zeta or drift, but they made the cut and feudal didnt. Not sure what the point of a top 8 vote was if half the results werent going to be used... could just as easily have done a top 4 vote, used those and had the admins choose the final 4, as that seemed to be the plan in any case.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

fixed<br>
<br>
As previously stated, the lower level admins did not pick any of the maps.  I was asked if there was one map that I would want to see but I thought the one I would have chosen was going to be in anyway.  I apparently also misunderstood how the maps were being done.  Had I realized, Icepick would probably have replaced Swamplight and I would have picked Icepick because of the number of votes it had.  As far as I am aware, the head admin, whomever they were, has always chosen the maps since season 1.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I chose most of the 1v1 maps for the length of my adminship, though i did have the occasional decision vetod. Cant recall if the 2v2/4v4 admins ever had any say in the maps; i believe not, but then those divisions were also running prior to my time as admin.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thanks for the clarification.  Like I said, I was not sure.  All I can say is that this is my 3rd season as admin and I have never had any decision making ability on the maps with the exception of being able to pick one map per season starting my second season as admin.  I made a poll between two maps and the winner got in: dm_Joyride.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Agree even if it was a joke, the forum is FULL of utter nonsense and some of the most retarded posts I've ever read (the reason I don't use it). but the archive of previously played games was interesting.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I would not say that. it was in the past when there was hardly any admin rules being enforced it which is too be expected when there are no rules. But there has been big changes at cu with new managment and we pritty much had it uncontrol and was getting new guys in the game with a more tough approach on player conduct.<br>
<br>
some may point their nose up at cu and brand players in it negative way. But cu severed hl2dm Europe community for a long time where esl complete failed at listening to the community needs and cu was there for us where others where not. We has 1500 members before hac we lost 500 of them and we have 300 players competing where we where gradually building up to 400 player base. <br>
<br>
Now we got to suspend the deadline for week3 while we fix everything. we lost our match archive which has screens and demos of some great games between great clans which is a great lost of 8 seasons of cu history. <br>
<br>
sadly there last back up for 2008 feb and webmaster to the site is on holiday so got allot of work to do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It was half a joke..<br>

I remember going on to the forums and trying to see who was winning the latest cup etc, but only finding threads like "ZOMG THIS PLAYER HACKS!!11" <br>

I'm not saying this is the fault of the admins, but those kind of threads made me decide not to join clans united.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Then why people who got their account jacked (lolme) get laughed at?<br>
<br>
It is the duty of an aorganisation to set proper security and backup site often, they made a mistake, they will learn, they'll get back stronger - that is all.<br>

cu has always been a pretty lame league compared to other professional leagues like cal. i wasnt surprised at all when i found out no one has a recent back up of the database. i have actually been working very hard to restore the site and help the admin team since the hacking incident occured but now basically those people who didnt move a finger to help us get cu back on the road want to erase everything weve done and just simply revert back to a fucking old update when the current season hadnt even started yet. tbh i would love to get those hours back i spent trying to help cu, it was such a waste of time. i even cleaned some of the crap up current and former admins left behind, but except for a few people from the admin team, no one is grateful for anything ive done. so im asking myself, why the fuck did i stay up till 5 am recovering their shit? <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> lets not forget about tamara either, whose work is abotu to get flushed down the toilet too. every1 thinks nix is some cool guy for hosting the league. well i could grab the database any second and just host the whole thing myself and i wouldnt start playing the boss like nix did, everything would be the same as now except for the incompetent admin team.<br>

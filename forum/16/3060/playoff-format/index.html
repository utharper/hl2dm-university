	<div class="content">How do you want the finals do be run double or single elimination. Double elimination always makes sure the final match is played by the best 2 teams. It also gives the chance their will be a come back. But the problem is it takes longer. For 8 teams to make it it will require 6 scheduled days of play. In previous seasons people have complained about the the rigorous match schedule. <br>

Please do not flame or stray from the point.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Also, of all the things that you could have allowed voting on, why this? Potentially adding a huge luck factor to the playoffs just to save 2 rounds / 1 week worth of time, when the pre + main seasons are already 10 weeks total in the first place, makes no sense at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

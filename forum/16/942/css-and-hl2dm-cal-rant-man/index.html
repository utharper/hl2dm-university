	<div class="content">Well first 1v1 for CAL week 1 I had to play against a guy from cs:s that was doing 1v1 league "just for fun." Well i won, he didnt get a kill execpt when i stood in front of him and let him smg me dead. Quite frankly im tired of people that arent serious about this game joining the league. Like i go to post the win, and come to find out my match has turned into a BYE week. so GG cs:s people. I even offered to teach him how to get good, like the basics of hl2dm and EVEN mentioned this site to him. He wanted nothing to do with it and his reply was "i dont recieve lessons" <br>
Soooo GG,<br>
<br>
edit: upon auctually starting the match i took to liberty to show this guy around the map and explain where weapons were, and how to cook nades. so GG</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

PM me on the CAL site; long as you have the screens, i can log it as a proper win instead of a forfeit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i feel the exact same way.<br>
<br>
either i get clobbered by  players who have played for longer or i play CS player who can't get into a division and wants more CAL fps experience.<br>
these experiences have ranged from positive to downright loathesome.<br>
<br>
if the game was larger you could have CS like layers of skill level with invite only leage. <br>
however due to the lower level of participants in the league you play with the competition that comes to the table.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

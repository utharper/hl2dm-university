	<div class="content">OK so we were haveing a convo in IRC and we thought it would be a good idea to have a discussion about maps again.<br>
<br>
Cant promise all your ideas will be heard, the admins havent even discussed it yet but here goes.<br>
<br>
A couple ideas I had and or heard for maps were these<br>
<br>
Caverns as 4v4 and 2v2  (replace Biohazard on 4v4 with it)<br>
TDM_Warlock as 2v2 and 4v4<br>
Lostarena as 2v2 as well as 1v1<br>
Insomnia as 1v1? <br>
L33thuania as 2v2 and maybe 4v4?<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">I'd like to see Zeta either fixed for competitive purposes or removed all together. <br>
<br>
The inside is way to powerful (rpg, ar2 and orbs,smg nades, shotguns and tons of armor) and there are 2 spawns inside. <br>
From my experience playing zeta, the match is often decided by the person or teams that get either the inside spawn or can get inside first. The rest of the match becomes a non stop king of the hill rpg campfest, and too bad if this is not your style your gonna lose if you don't do it.<br>
<br>
 Due to the inside spawns the other person or team stuck outside are at a great disadvantage based on the luck of the first spawn and I don't feel this is what a CAL map/match should be like. The are no other maps in CAL that work this way, and I don't think Zeta should either. The fact that someone can spawn inside and someone can spawn far outside means that it is not a fair race to the rpg from the get go, and the only way this map is ever played is by racing then camping rpg.<br>
<br>
 I really don't think king of the hill maps (they always promote camping over skilled play) have any place in CAL in the first place but if the map were to be fixed I'd say make all spawn points a equal distance from rpg, get rid of inside spawns and put a AR2 outside as to make use of the many orbs which are already outside.<br>
<br>
I will make another post about replacement map suggestions later although I can say I'd play caverns over zeta any day.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think zeta is ok. It's not as hard as you think to attack the inside, you just need to know how to spam nades from the outside. But having ar2 on the out area would be better IMO. maybe 2 ar2s?<br>
It is way harder if you are playing zeta in a 1v1, but on a team game (2v2 or 4v4), with the correct tactics you can handle yourself.<br>
I'm not saying it's freaking easy, but well done you can end up killing people from the outside.<br>
Last CAL zeta match I played, I got 3 kills with nades from the outside to the inside.<br>
Regarding the cavs vs bio modification.<br>
I really like caverns, but I really like bio too. The problem is I never played any of them on a 4v4, so I can't really say anything :/</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Caverns: 3v3 seemed like a sweet number for it. I'm not too sure how it would turn out for 4v4s, but it is a great team map with many things to hold control of. RPG, AR2, 200, etc.<br>
<br>
Lostarena: I've never 2v2ed on it yet. However, I'd assume the shortage of weapons would make some players dislike it.<br>
<br>
Insomnia: I haven't played the map enough to form an opinion, but the size and amount of weapons probably suits a 1v1.<br>
<br>
Warlock: No. No 4v4. Please. 2v2, maybe. This map plays very similar to Lostvillage except more cramped.<br>
<br>
Leethunia? 4v4? It's not gonna work. The whole openness + dirtwork style and small size isn't good for eight people. I think even 2v2 is pushing it. It seems much more ideal as a 1v1 map.<br>
<br>
IDKYet: IDK yet, but it may be best map evar.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i know this won't happen, but i'm just throwing this out there - i'd like to see amplitude removed. amplitude is seriously one of the worst maps i've ever played in leagues, maybe edged only by dm_carousel, since i've started playing this game. it's a classic rocket control map except it doesn't have enough health and suit and other guns and a complete lack of physics just makes it a huge clusterfuck at the rocket. a suit machine may fix this, but even so, its lack of physics and guns just makes it a spawn and spam grenades map.<br>

since it won't be removed, i'd like to at least see it not in the playoffs<br>

this is my problem with amplitude<br>
<br>
since you're playing it 4vs4 the problem is much worse, so the result is just spawning, tossing 2 grenades, smg, then die. i am a pretty conservative player but it's hard to play smart when the map won't let you</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

this is why the other thread got out of hand, just state which maps you like and don't and why if you want.  Lets just try and state our opinions on the maps rather then refuting other peoples opinions.<br>
<br>
--------CAL season 4, 4v4 map list ------------<br>
 	dm_lostvillage<br>
	dm_aftermath<br>
 	dm_swamplight_final<br>
	dm_avalon_b1<br>
	dm_amplitude_r1<br>
 	dm_biohazard_cal<br>
 	dm_zeta_prefinal<br>
 	dm_lockdown_r3<br>
<br>
so the was the line-up for the 4v4 last season.<br>
<br>
dm_aftermath_fixed  - might be worth a look, didn't really love/hate it one way or the other after my cal match on it.<br>
dm_avalon_r1 - been i map i don't care for but if others like it fine.  I'd rather only play it 2v2 really.<br>
dm_swamplight_final - It's a quailty map, for ffa.  Its been in leagues since the start.  But if we can find a better map i'd go with it.<br>
<br>
still haven't played dm_biohazard 4v4 or if i did i didn't have a problem, would seem to small.  Love it 2v2/1v1 though<br>
dm_lockdown_r3 love the new hall and changes, other then the windows, which i stated before since now the window blocks my favorite weapon the x-bow.<br>
amp, lv, zeta i love for 4v4<br>
<br>
Maps i'd like to see in<br>
<br>
DM_carvens_r1 people love this map in the draft 4v4,  it is the most voted on for sure other then lockdown.  And most teams i scrim suggest it to play.<br>
<br>
tdm_warlock - played 2 scrims on it 4v4, it kinda plays out like lostvillage with props.  Played the dm version 4v4 and oddly enough that may be better suited for 4v4 play as with tdm you will be left with no weapon every once in a while and it has enough hp but it is spread out and they are 10 packs mostly. tdm_warlock was great 3v3/2v2<br>
<br>
dm_octogon - r1?  what an i say, after the 4v4 on draft night that we lost, but was a very tight game the entire time.    This map was already shot down for league play and i'm not sure why.  But i'd love to see it.<br>
<br>
dm_L33thuania - looked like it had some promise, i'd like to scrim it b4 i make up my mind.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
--------CAL season 4, 2v2 map list ------------<br>
<br>
dm_lostvillage<br>
dm_caverns_r1<br>
dm_vault<br>
dm_avalon_b1<br>
dm_amplitude_r1<br>
dm_biohazard_cal<br>
dm_zeta_prefinal<br>
dm_lockdown_r3<br>
<br>
<br>
I like this line-up for 2v2 <br>
<br>
maps i'd like to see in:<br>
<br>
dm_lostarena -  I love this map 2v2,  shit i didn't mind it when i scrimmed it 4v4, but 3v3 is pushing it, and i wouldn't wanna play it 4v4 in a league.<br>
<br>
tdm_warlock - great 2v2 map imo,  perfect amount of weapons and hp for a 2v2<br>
<br>
dm_L33thuania - this may be best suited for 2v2/3v3 but i haven't scrimmed it <br>
<br>
---------- Thats all i can think of now. I don't 1v1 so i will not go there, althou i'd like to try one on staminia for fun</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You may be so high and mighty now, but we all have had the days that we sucked. When we were all coming up to, we used to be beat by the people that we talk shit to now. Now, I believe I helped you get better when you were in aXon. I'm not going to go around posting screenshots because that makes me as low as some of the other people. Like one of my favorite Lil Wyte songs. "Whether you a rapper, a dope dealer, a producer, or whatever. Before you cross the person that put you on, go back and look at yourself in some pictures in those dirty ass clothes. And think would I be in the same position that I am now if it weren't for those folks." Here's some advice, if you don't post anything, the thread will die. <br>
<br>
I'm not on anyone's side, but I'm just putting out a general statement for everyone.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I don't talk to you much BI, but that doesn't mean I don't respect and recognise what you've done for me. I recognise and thanks anyone that helped me achieve the level of play I have now, even if they just helped me fix some little thing I wasn't doing right, I know I don't show most of that and most of what I think usually, and I also know that it's one of my weaknesses. And I never tell anyone they suck or that I'm a way better player than them unless they're really pissing me off, I always loved and still like to teach what I know to people that need/want it and I like seeing them progress and even become a better player than me, it feels like I've accomplished something and helped them achieve something they wished to achieve.<br>
<br>
So while I'm on this topic, I'll like to thank: Zman, Luke, A Seagull, Book, Bad Influence, Conflict, Ninjins, Gas Mask, Fearsome, tlc, teto, and anyone that I'm probably just not thinking of right now that helped me getting better in any kind of way in this game. This list isn't in any particular order, just wrote them as they came out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

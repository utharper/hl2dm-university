Atlantic time and Eastern time are not the same.  Atlantic time zone (Canada) is one hour ahead of Eastern (US and Canada).

Are we talking CAL business conversations, or just general conversations between players?  Does this mean that if I post a conversation between Player X and myself for lulz I can be punished?  And what are the penalties and repercussions?  Those need to be listed otherwise an admin can just make up a punishment that doesn't fit the offense.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No edit from Css doesn't really have any baring on HL2dm since if hl2dm got big enough the first split would be a Cal-open and Cal-main division. <br>

Any post in public (Irc, forums of any kind other then private) of a private conversation from an Admin, match comm, disputes. <br>
<br>
Obviously has been lacking enforcement of this rule.  As many members should have/could have been suspended.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

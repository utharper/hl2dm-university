	<div class="content">A ladder goes on for ever and is probably why not many are interested in the idea. This OSe could work but a ladder system will fail teams and players like to have a goal or reward out of these comp. With a ladder it just a case of staying on top and over time which it just getting boring for those below. 1v1 for ladder may be ok for a ladder but for teams I never seen it work for hl2dm. It just get boring over time.<br>
<br>
your better off having a league set up and brake down in divisions of skill all most like CU  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green">. Not sure if it work down you end but I found it as a good way of getting teams playing others of similar skill.<br>
<br>
edit** there are plenty of goals in this method there of course fighting it out to be champions of league and then thers the lower divisions which are fighting for promotion and avoiding demotion. Their just so much more other than wining the league which is why you will have better turn out and activity in the league.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The reason I like the ladders is because you pick who you play (which suck for me in this game cause nobody will play me, but whatever). If you play better players, you get more points. If you're a wuss and only player shitty ones, you get less points.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Everything is decided on the very end date. You have to play consistently well for the duration of the season to win. You also play on your own time schedule, this would be good for teams like fusion since they're on late and don't always make it to scheduled matches.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No, 1v1 and 2v2 are a given.  The poll was to find out if there was a preference for 3v3 OR 4v4.  I am talking about a comprehensive HL2Dm league here that will incorporate 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3, not just one division.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

nothing, it should be the best place for hl2dm, few forfeits etc.  But OSE will get the new players (likely a lot that don't like it to don't try it) they wouldn't see the warzone site.  OGL would also expose hl2dm to other gamers.  Something warzone can't do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is a double edged sword IMO.  Joining a multi-game league to expose us to other gamers only seems to get a bunch of CSS nerds coming in and signing up and then not playing.  We all know what a fubar that was in CAL, and honestly was nothing more than a pain in the ass for both the players and the admins.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is nothing in the rules about it which is complete BS.   Please tell me where in any legitimate league it is allowed to use unrostered players to play a league match.   Why not just make it a free for all tourney with mix teams...oh wait thats Draft Night<br>

<br>
Again, in ANY legitimate league it would not be allowed, ever, not in the regular season and not in the preseason.  Preseason is to allow your team some practice together.  Munster isnt rostered on that warzone team so thats 2 unrostered not 1.  Im sure Confused wasnt too happy about it but probably pressured to do it because if he didnt the team would have been probably removed?  <br>
<br>
This is just another example of how the rules in Warzone change to suit the head admin.  Im sure 911 would never have fielded a team with 2 unrostered players to just "get it done" because OMG they might have to post a loss on their match record.<br>
<br>
And as far as my proposal, considering the traffic on this site these days and most if not all of the 'no' votes were probably 911 members, Id say there is support for a new league.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It was actually very funny trying to get this match played.  Black Flame kept vetoing the unrostered players Confused came up with (because they were all great players).  Flame kept pushing Confused towards Pomp in the hopes it would give us a bit of a chance (no offense Pomp) because we knew that Blender would spend more time crashing than playing.  Indeed I would bet that the first game we spent more time playing 3v2 than 3v3 because of Blender crashing.  Our sole tactic was to try to kill Pomp as much as possible.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>

There's a difference between bitching and poking fun at hypocrisy.  I'm not playing, therefore, I'm not bitching.  You can make the rules say that you automatically win if you have a teammate with a third nipple and use <a href="http://www.liquimetal.com/hl2mp/maps/dm_tight_yo.bsp.bz2" class="postlink">dm_tight_yo</a> for the finals.  I really don't care.  If you're hypocritical in the process, and I notice it, I'm still going to make fun of it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What I did was point out how hypocritical it is for Dal to tell one team to get their pre-season matches done or be disqualified, and then he tells someone else that pre-season matches don't really matter.  If you want my respect, you'll have to earn it, and that's not gonna cut it.  In the past Warzone had my support, and I would still be supporting it if I was playing, but you can't tell one team one thing, and another team something else.  That's called bias.  I don't care if ewR were a bunch of baby eating Palin supporters with tattoos of giant cocks on their foreheads, if you gonna run a league, you're going to have to run it without bias, without silly flaws in the rule structure, and treat all teams the same no matter what.  <br>
   <br>
If you want to call it bitching, then fine.  We'll drop the semantics so you can be happy.  Yep, Dal's put alot of time and effort into Warzone.  It would be a good idea at this point not to fuck it up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Now, is it just me, or does that map list completely contradict the promise of new competitive maps? Here we are, the remnants of a once not so fucked up game, trying to squeeze the last bit of life out of HL2DM as possible, and we're still playing leagues with maps that have been around for years. Come on. How is this helping the game? Warzone has completely disregarded almost every HL2DM map maker out there with this map list. It's a joke. Lockdown as the finals? Give me a break. Caverns had 5 more votes than any other map, and airfusion had the same amount as LD, but we're stuck playing a ported-4 year old-single player map in the finals of the second season of Warzone. Way to go!

LOL idk. 1st time Ive seen book rage it, I came into the 911 server the day this started and he was raging so hard about ewr I had to tell a few jokes to calm him the fuck down. oh well, I guess that leaves blasphemy squad as the only competitive player I've seen to never publically or in game rage about something, divinity was the 3rd man standing but look how that worked out :/ guess the rage inside accumulates and we all pop, just a matter of time guise. RIP old book well all miss you ;(</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

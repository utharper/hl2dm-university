	<div class="content">Is this the right place to post this?? ...Anyway,<br>
<br>
Hello all HL2DM players,<br>
<br>
We (Lich and Silla) decided to make a fun competition for the jump maps enthusiasts to see who is the fastest player of several jump maps.<br>
This is a fun competition, the prize will be your own sense of reward <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
For the matter of this event we created a website with all related information and the maps in which the competition will take place.<br>
<br>
The competition dates are still to be announced, but will be so very shortly. During the time of its duration you can provide as many races on as many maps you want. There is no limits to your attempts on being the fastest one. Finally at the end of competition we will publish a ranking based on the fastest races.<br>
<br>
The winner demo of each map will become a video as prize, where everyone can see his jumps and may receive many compliments ^^ We are not commercialy organized ... so no cars or bunnies as gift ...  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
Go check it out:<br>

You do the maps as you please. If you prefer to not bhop then you'll loose advantage, cuz someone will probably be faster by bhopping. I noticed it a few times in some maps, like Darkskill on jumpstyle lvl6, but he bumped into the wall and that level is kind of insignificant, so no real point in restarting just cuz of that.<br>
He also did it, and vels too, in the nub maps, but these jumps are a bit too short at times, and the rotating platforms are unpredictable and a bit bad for time trials...<br>
But it's not forbidden anyway. But players know that they must be fast if they want to win, so...<br>
Only map exploits aren't allowed (skipping levels, etc)<br>
<br>
The silent sprint happens to me a lot too, specialy when going from crouched stance. I'm still gonna look a bit deeper into it.<br>
<br>
Now, about that aux thing in Ulti... I had not noticed it, and supposedly neither did Silla... I emailed him. I dunno what will be done.<br>
<br>
But yea, it's like you said, we're running into new grounds here and it's all still a bit "experimental", so to say. We thought about such problems on the start, but we just went forward with it just to see how it'd turn out, and have a bit of fun managing it and provide some fun to ppl too hopefully. Lets see if there's a next time, if we pay a bit more attention to some details, (Ulti = lesson learned) and hopefully not have any unfair stuff.<br>
<br>
Thanks for noticing that, Ade.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

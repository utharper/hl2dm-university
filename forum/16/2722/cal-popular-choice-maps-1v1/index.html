Nobody nominated it.<br>

Edit- It was nominated for 4v4.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>badinfluence wrote:</cite>Amplitude? Seriously?</div></blockquote>
It was nominated.<br>

Note that no one bothered to nominate original lockdown, either. Unfortunate, as it would be interesting to see which version is actually more popular.<br>

I guess that you saying replace dm_lockdown_r3 with a fixed version of dm_lockdown wasn't enough to nominate dm_lockdown?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

?<br>
What do you want from me,<br>
I made an official nominations thread, then as per fearsomes request pulled all the nominated maps from that thread and compiled them into a list.<br>
?<br>
I don't see how number of views says anything...if people choose to ignore map nominations or just blindly assume theyve already nominated then i think people are setting themselves up to be dissapointed when their vote is not heard. If you care enough to want to nominate your map of choice why not check the new threads that come up in the league section pertaining to map choice?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Fearsome, at the time I made the thread we were still debating the details of it behind the scenes so I did not want to state explicitly that it was going to end up in a vote, but that was the intent.  I did compile a list of the maps mentioned in my thread and posted them in the CAL Admin section for review of the CAL admins where I stated: <blockquote class="uncited"><div> Fearsome, you had mentioned at that you wanted to do some kind of vote for maps in CAL. Well I started a nomination thread in the League forums to get feedback on possible maps. Lets see what they come up with.</div></blockquote>

 If you go back and look at that admin thread, I did post a draft list of maps "for a poll" for 2v2 and 4v4.  As I recall, not everyone responded to it so it didnt get to the next step.  Then Zman started his thread.  People obviously thought that the first thread was valid, and IMO, the second one should never have been started in the first place since most if not all the maps listed there were in the first thread.  <br>
<br>
In fact I questioned the need for a second thread but I see my post was conveniently deleted but the quote some one made of it was not:<br>

	<div class="content">The thing, the people on this board thought that the thread entitled MAPS IN CAL? was a nomination thread.  After all it does say "MAPS IN CAL" and it was posted by an admin.  It is implied that it is going to be used to pick maps for CAL.  Also the "No promises that a nominated map will become a CAL map" also implies that the thread is seeking nominations for CAL.   It was so that if someone posted an obviously flawed map, it gave us a means to not accept it for a poll.   <br>
<br>
The main thing that bothers me is that people took the effort to post in the first thread, it has 4x the response than the second thread, and their input is going to be ignored.  I am at the point where I am reluctant to put any effort into anything.  There is no communication and when we attempt to start a discussion, it gets ignored so here we sit spinning our wheels and nothing gets done.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

How about listing any map that is mentioned in this thread or any other thread related to CAL maps? This isnt some government organization that has to stick by the rules. Its a game for christ sakes. There is no reason that Lost Village shouldnt be on the list since its been brought up as missing. How about setting the voting toware you can change your picks and add all the maps that have been brought up. Does a specific thread really matter here?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Because we would have 10000000 maps most of which would have 0 votes. <br>
<br>
If you really want to revote we can it will just delay the season by 2 weeks maybe more depending on how many maps are nominated. And of course we will need to make a vote on that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Fearsome, we DO NOT have to renominate maps, just redo the current poll to include the maps from the other thread so that the input that people have taken the time and consideration to put in gets included.  It wont delay the season 2 weeks, it will be one week at most.  It will allow for more teams to join the open divisions and those teams with only one or two people (there are a lot of these) to get their roster filled so in that respect will wont be a bad thing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

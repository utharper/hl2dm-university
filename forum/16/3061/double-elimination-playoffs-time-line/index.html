	<div class="content">In the past we have run double elimination playoffs in 3 weeks. However with open and main divisions now it is likely that more active teams will make playoffs and the desire to complete playoffs sooner will be less of an issue. Would you like to schedule a double elimination playoff to last just 3 weeks with 2 matches per week, or 5 or 6 weeks with 1 match per week except the finals. It is also an issue this season having kb leagues that players who wish to compete in both will have a hard time. You can imagine between all leagues their will be 10 scheduled matches per week in a 3 week schedule.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Just for a little bit more explanation and for the sake of the discussion.<br>
<br>
To schedule 5 leagues 1v KB, 2v KB, Reg 1v, reg 2v and reg 4v with 2 matches per week is going to be crazy if people are participating in both.<br>
<br>
We will have to schedule some of the playoffs for these leagues on the same days<br>
<br>
Just as an example in past seasons with double elim and 2 matches per week:<br>
Reg 1v would be Monday and Thursday<br>
Reg 2v would be Tuesday and Friday<br>
Reg 4v would be Wedsday and Saturday<br>
<br>
So this leaves the question:  What to do with the 2 KB leagues?<br>
<br>
One idea we were kicking around was<br>
kb 1v Monday and Thursday<br>
KB 2v Tuesday and Friday<br>
<br>
Or reverse them to<br>
<br>
KB 1v Tuesday and Friday<br>
KB 2v Monday and Thursday<br>
<br>
The reason we are thinking of avoiding the days for 4v4 is because we all know how hard it can be to get 4 players together as it is so we thought it might be best to avoid hangups with those days.<br>
<br>
Please discuss constructive ideas and suggestions<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">If i were running the league, id set it to 1/week, to give ample time for practice, disputes and lenient scheduling.<br>
<br>
Personally, im fine either way, but not everyone has a flexible schedule, and 2 matches per week has been the cause of forfeits in the past. Id also rather win due to my own skill as opposed to an afk opponent.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">one game per week.  if an individual is participating in all 4 divisions he/she will be used to the schedule by then.  if anything i would get rid of the double elim.  just makes the playoffs last WAAAYYYY too long.  and really, how many times has that team from the "1loss" bracket come back to win it all?  i would rather have each match be a best of 5 instead of best of 3.  get it all done in one night, you can rotate players if you want.  winner moves on, loser is done.  simple.

Dont forget seed 1 plays seed 8 first round which is kinda screwed for seed 8 if its single elim.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We did this one season the main problem we found was that once people had their first loss and no longer had a shot at the top spot they just did not play the rest of their matches. It was nice however that you could place all teams in 4 weeks since we took 16 teams to the finals.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

2 v 2 or 1 v 1 I totally agree. <br>
<br>
With that said, it should be round robin for the regular season for 4 v 4. I hate the fact that some teams dont play others. Especially when a whole schedule isnt presented before the season starts. Who decides on who plays who and what week they play? Why not make the regular season as long as it needs to be. If there are less then 6 teams then each team should play each other twice. I also feel that if you are 8 seed and get killed by the 1 seed, you are more then likely gonna get killed by the other top 5 seeds since teams are fairly close in terms of skill. Double elim is a drag lol. Did last season's 4 v 4 playoffs even get finished?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

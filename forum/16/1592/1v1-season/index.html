my last CAL experience was mixed.<br>
<br>

or<br>
i get a bitchass counter-strike knob who will refuse to meet the limited time frame (sorry daytime only)<br>
and i end up getting a forfeit loss, or the person described above will meet during the daytime and get a forfeit win b/c they leave after loosing first round. yay. <br>

i'm not going to win CAL. that much i'm well aware. what i'd like from CAL is the chance to play a good match. lopsided matches are fun for neither party involved.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

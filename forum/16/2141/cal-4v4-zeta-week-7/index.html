No, I contacted the author and asked to get a final version of the current map, not to make a new "balanced" zeta. It should play almost the same as prefinal, that IS the point. Sorry you are disappointed, but I think the goal we set out to achieve was right on the mark: a cleaned up version that does not play significantly differently in terms of strategy.<br>
<br>
There are many more changes than those you have mentioned, but you would have to study prefinal pretty hard next to this version to find them. The reduction in crappy props alone is enough to make the map play so much cleaner and smoother, it no longer becomes a cluster fuck in the main building. I also really like the fact that the skybox is raised way up. Try shooting smg nades up and into the main building now for example.<br>
<br>
People who don't like zeta will continue to dislike it, but that doesn't mean the time put into initiating contacting the author, testing the revisions and providing detailed feedback were a waste. How would you like it if I took your favorite map and "rebalanced" it so that it completely changes the way it plays? How about lost village for example, how come nobody complains about the rpg whoring that happens there? I think I was spawn raped with RPG about 10 times in a row in one match, it was just ridiculous how many times I spawned in the courtyard, or in another open spot where someone was camping with rpg.<br>
<br>
I still have had some of my closest and most balanced matches in zeta (1 point in it versus DGC back in the day, only a few frags between fusion vs. nino and ghost dog, tied with lost soul). When you play a team that plays it well you lose hard, but then whose fault it that?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

as WT said, this statement is wrong.  The mapper was happy with his map and rightly so. Just wanted to put the final touches on it.  <br>
<br>
It is a King of the hill style map, and with most all spawns outside, the spawns will not get completely destroyed. <br>

Any good <span style="text-decoration:underline">team</span> i have played was able to get the RPG from outside one way or another</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

we hoped to have this all done weeks ago but things got busy for me and others. By now people should be able to upload this map to their server and their server should have always been set up to allow downloads. I am not saying it is ideal but we need to move it forward.<br>
<br>
As grain said it basically plays the same so you wont have game breaking surprises. We really need as many matches to happen on the map as possible. Grain is just mad cause in all our matches with him he was going up on the roof and camping the out of bounds stuff now he cant. I also disagree the outside has been made better then before not by a ton but still better. Those hills grain complains about allow you to get to armor faster,  armor has also been added outside, they also have been carefully designed such that just simple walking will allow you to move any direction on those hills and never get blocked (so whats all this im gonna get stuck about) while still allowing people to have obstacles which they can move down into to avoid fire or up to the top to take a better position or jump up to armor. Lots of junk physics have been removed so people do not trip on as much all the stairs have been clipped so you can slide up them faster. Under the stairs where people hide has been blocked. Physics can no longer all be tossed out of the map and the new roof has been made so should not be able to camp on it though there are some instances where you can which we will fix. This means that now you can nade jump phys boost or whatever to get into the rocket and not have your match overturned. Tons of small visual errors were fixed and HDR support was added. A new way out of the canal has been added so you do not get trapped in their as much. Every single possible addition to the map was a net zero or loss to the rocket inside. But some people have always hated the map and always will and nothing will change their mind when someone comes and says the exact opposite. That is fine I hate many maps in CAL too but to each his own different people like different things you have to learn to respect that even if you do not agree with it.<br>
<br>
As said multiple times we never set out to flatten zeta if we did it would not be zeta and we would not be running the map in CAL. We set out to polish the map up make it more exploit free, our goal is to remove any rules for the map and just let people play however they can also have it look great and be well polished.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I still don't understand implementing a new version during the week of the map. Having people play it is another issue. Why would you put an unknown untested map in during the season? And why does it have to vetted and played before the playoffs? Why is it so important for the playoffs but not now?<br>
Even if it plays the same, it is not the same.<br>
CAL should substitute NO map during the season.<br>
I don't hate the map. I like all the CAL maps but Cannon.<br>
Ill leave it at that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well we have swapped maps out before with out any problems lockdown revised went up a revision during a season. Also as Zman said we have been play testing it quite a bit. It is a solid build certainly less error prone then the first. I do agree that we should not swap maps mid season but if I don't do it now it will take forever and after we wrap this up we are on to another amplitude revision and other maps. If I slow it down I feel like I am just wasting time and whatever I can get done I need to just push forward so I can go to the next thing. As stated before the goal is all 8 maps are great examples of maps that look great perform well and have a unique gameplay, when 1 falls behind it gets chopped off in order to get to that we have to move forward on what ever we are doing as we can.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

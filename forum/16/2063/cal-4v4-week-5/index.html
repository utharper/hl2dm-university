instead of having this in as a map to tide us over i would rather have played some other map more times. shitty maps right now are not as good as decent maps later</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Plus, considering this map has both teams spawning with the crowbar and stunstick, expect more crashes.

getting close to the halfway point, we should start thinking of an replacement.  <br>

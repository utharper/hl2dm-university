	<div class="content">Hey guys, tomorrow is the official start date, as in matches are officially available to be played and reported on Wednesday. Rosters are unlocked throughout the season however map choices will be locked in. I need you guys to post on CU if you want your map changed before it locks tomorrow. Also I need nX to make a decision on a map or we may take some punitive action. <br>
<br>
<br>
Examples of how to post for when you want a match to be played and agreed upon is in the CU forums, how Da11aS and Edge have done it is correct. Impala's team has been added to the waiting list in case of inactivity by any division 2 team.<br>
<br>
Love,<br>

There is no official map list when it comes to Americans, we play an extremely wide variety of maps so if a clan suggests a map thats reasonable and non-killbox it will be your map....and no the season HASNT started yet.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
 There is no "big list" to choose from, I thought that was unwise. Your clan wants to play Jaegar? You can play Jaegar. You want to play Mileau? Play Mileau. I even thought it would be fun to agree to have Sacrifist have aim_arena_reloaded as their clan map, something new and radical for a change. KBH maps were crossing the line though and I think just about everyone except a certain few agree with that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

lol relax...the way I got admin was pure luck in the first place. Warrior happened to be a long time European friend, he was made admin of American league, he asked for advice and I gave advice everyday until I was reccomended to be an admin. It's not as if I actively sought to be an admin in any league so far, at any rate I was poking fun at you because of course your team will be expediantly placed in 3v3/2v2 should a team not play their first few matches... but per usual you take everything to the extreme.  I'm not getting off on some big power trip as my powers are checked and limited. <br>

<br>
Awesome. Don't forget to record these matches guys...<br>
<br>
<br>
On a different note, I would to take Chemicals idea and suggest to you guys to wear a tag to commemorate the passing of p!ke and Mike throughout the season. Chemical came up with .m!b after your name, although you can wear any varience of a memorial tag after your name to your styling.<br>
<br>
I know some of you did not know either of them and may not feel comfortable with doing this so it's not mandatory to wear the tag, its just out of respect for our fallen. At the very least if the players don't I hope the team captains can wear them to show solidarity with our small community.<br>
<br>
BTW team 911 and Syn, we will get back to soon about a date for our matches, waiting on word from Bahlk.<br>
<br>
P.S. I'm not suggesting the entire CU league, just the Americans</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
You do but having sourcetv relay for spectators is not mandatory, as long as the match is sourcetv recorded with POV's in case of advanced cheating disputes is what is necessary. Having a relay up is something ofc I'd strongly encourage for the "big matches" of div 1 and div 2. <br>

Okay...changed. sv_25000 will be used, that was the reccomendation I got that from a few people, of course a few people can be wrong about the best rates. In response to the question of having games pausible by a person, it was option along with FF that was not chosen to be part of the American league. It is an American style to just play on and reconnect real quick, but keep in mind if you do want the pause option on it could be abused by an angry team. If you want I need a majority of team captains to state so or PM me.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT; One more thing, we need to get one more team signed up for Division 2 by Wednesday the 17th or else divison 2 will go to a shorter season or have a week break to compensate for the lack of a 6th team.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I just thought about that and I realized I cant count how many times we accidently relied on a false team score because of crashes against $W, Xs ect when $W really won or we really won. Makes me support this measure far more, especially since I have a distinct feeling that.... <br>
<br>
1. The playoffs and/or the championship games ARE GOING TO HAVE REALLY CLOSE FINAL SCORES (In 2v2 specifically, not 3v3 so much)<br>
2. So far the pause option is not being pushed too hard by our teams, although its actually gaining some momentum in popularity for the idea.<br>
3. Because we will have crashes because the pause option has not yet been pushed by a majority of captains (Please PM on CU, steam or here if you want it), and because we will have close games in the playoffs and championship, the last thing I want to have in the finals is a score dispute to ruin the legitimacy of our champions<br>
<br>
<br>
So I do 100% think its unexcusable for it not to be implemented due to myths about a basic form of keeper which absolutely does not conflict with server smoothness.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I cannot speak for CU but in CAL the reasons for not running plugins were security reasons. Some people say the plugins (any no matter how small) cause lag or bad hit reg. But the larger problem is that by enabling the plugins you open up the real possibility for admin abuse. A server admin could upload another plugin or spoof the keeper plugin and pretty much do anything they wanted to with a coder as far as cheating goes. Simple example you code the plugin to recognize your players and they only take half damage. In the heat of matches and the hit reg in this game no one would ever know. <br>
<br>
Now that we know a simple console command added to a config is the only thing needed to stop impulse 51 the only advantage to the plugin is scores. It hardly seems like it is worth the security risk just to fix scores. In CAL I cannot remember there ever being a score dispute maybe another admin remembers one but it was certainly not a large problem. Everyone was instructed to take demos in the unlikely event a score dispute took place those could be gone through to take care of it if the scenario of crashes plus a close game led to a score dispute. The CAL admins thought this through and considered all options before going the way we went.<br>
<br>
It is my opinion that if you are going to run plugins then you should be running plugins like zblock that actually help secure the game in addition to keepers plugin. Opening up the league to a security flaw just for a single feature that should rarely be a problem just does not seem worth the risk for the insignificant gain it brings. Any 2 mature clans could resolve a scoring problem on their own rather than wasting a dispute on one since their was a 2 dispute limit and that pretty much took care of the problem. <br>

Reread my post, and how would you know if an explosion did half damage or not? Don't bring up stupid examples sure some idiot could code a plugin to give himself 9999999 health but most guys are going to be smart enough to do things discreetly. It is just like any other cheat where people know what to do to not get caught, even though there are some idiots in pubs who may do it blatantly. <br>
<br>
I clearly said I am against plugins for security reasons, but IF you are going to run them which I cannot control because I am not an admin then you should also run security plugins. What is so hard to understand about that?<br>
<br>
Also just because no one has bitched about it in Europe doesn't mean it does not happen. Lots of people don't complain because they do not know what is possible, but lots of people who know how to code know how easy it would be to pull off such a cheat. I like the way you result to personal attacks I am doing nothing other then stating the facts and getting information out there for the decision making process. If I or my team was personally doing something like this I would have just kept my mouth shut wouldn't I have? And chances are if anyone was doing that in europe they would have kept their mouth shut too.<br>
<br>
I completely understand why this plugin is so great for FF on matches in europe but I do not understand why we need it in north america, and I really really do not understand why you guys do not run zblock or other plugins which add security features to prevent net setting exploits and so if you are already running a plugin.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

We had timeouts in CAL but never like this except when there was a botched Steam update and even then it happened all the time, not just in matches.  <br>
As far as the match cfg is concerned, I cant say I see anything out of the ordinary with the other server settings or a setting that I havent seen before that might be causing this.<br>

As for the plugin causing lag.  I dont believe that with today's server hardware that one plugin is going to cause a server to lag.  I have seen servers with many more and resource needy plugins without so much as a blip.

There were never any score based disputes. Hardly surprising, since its not hard to count frags/suicides in the event of a close score and the console log cant lie.<br>

Im reminded of that semi-recent league match where some retard used mani to silently toggle buddha (or whatever) and took 2-3 direct nades, a full shotgun clip and a barrel to the dome all within like 5 seconds without dying then timed out due to "lag".<br>
<br>
Like Fearsomes saying, its awfully easy for a semi competent coder to do similar with keepers plugin yet not be so stupidly obvious. Avoid overdoing the damage reduction and dont mess with weapons that have set damage amounts like mag/xbow... maybe give props a 1 in 4 chance to do nothing... no one would ever know. Seriously, people with shitty connections or wireless routers get similar benefits (if not so reliable) all the time; the corrupted plugins effects would just blend right in.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

here is the last example for a match without keepers plugin. the scores are fucked up. the keepers <strong class="text-strong">league</strong>-plugin is written especially for league using. clans-united is using it since at least 6 seasons for both 2v2 and 3v3, thats 100s or matches, and never someone complained about this. you cant tell me that if a team gets always only half of the damage in dozens of matches that noone would ever notice that.<br>

if we would always for every match have to check the console log to count each frag, we should need at least 5 admins only counting frags for each league. total bullshit imo. and that wont happen in clans-united.<br>
when we started the american league i said you can play in whatever mode you want, only a few cu-rules have to be followed. one of that rule is that the keeper league plugin has to be used in every single cu-war. <br>
<br>
maybe someone can get keeper here to state about security status with his league-plugin?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">There is one sulution to all this that can be considered. The admins won't have anything with the scores to do. The teams that play the match are the ones that have to make sure that there's a correct score. If disputes rise up an admin could be the final judge. Altough I advice you to allow playing with the pause as an option. Then only to be used in case of a crash. All other cases should be banned. <br>
<br>
Sorry about the personal attack Fearsome* but I'm sick and tierd of everyone blaming everyone for cheating  or suspecting the worse. In Europe we don't have this problem probably mainly becvause everyone, or almost everyone at least play on Silla's server. If we can't trust a nonplaying admin's server we shouldn't even play. <br>
<br>
I can see your point, I just doubt someone cheating in that way. Altough if some one can alter one plugin why shouldn't they be able to alter another one. I'd rather see no plugins than two. The rule of keepers plug in came up long ago. Before anyone taht's admin now was it really. Except me and Silver. <br>
<br>
I sat and looked through mails every day, counting scores from each map for both teams. Adding all of this by hand into something close to the awr but more stuff to fill in. This rule was made just because of the amout of time counting frags took. Now you players enter the score so one person don't have to do every single game and enter it. <br>
<br>
I can see why you're suspicious if you think it has happened in hl2dm (Plugin manipulating). I've only dealt with this  in css, but what shit doens't come from css?<br>
<br>
Consider my suggestion and tell me what you think? If you can handle counting and checking it yourself I actually see no problem with it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Yeah...I timed out like 6 times in a 5 minute span about 5-6 days ago out of nowhere. It either has to be the CU config or a steam related issue. We'll be running various tests to pin down whats going on, feel free to run your own tests, I.E. testing out a different config, if you find something and think you have proof do it with a source TV recording however to compare and contrast with definitive proof.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thank you Neo for your input, just as you posted this and I logged on steam I got a few PM's about game wide crashing in public servers too. I hope this issue is not here to stay in HL2DM and is more an issue of an overlogged steam client database being unable to handle high traffic or the like. <br>
<br>
<br>
THE PAUSE OPTION IN THE KEEPER PLUGIN IF BOTH TEAMS AGREE TO HAVE IT BE USABLE IS AVAILABLE FOR YOUR MATCHES! It's about the only safeguard we have right now to have something of a shell of a playable match until steam fixes whatever the issue may be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yea I have played some scrims in COD4 MW and the FF is on there too.  It definatly makes you more careful and puts more reliance in team strat than spam.  They also need to run a mod/plugin for the TWL league.  Its really only in the N.A. HL2DM community where we get this anti mod/plugin debate/attitude.   CSS leagues all require zblock or some other mod. <br>
<br>
 Personally as far as Keepers plugin is concerned, I think that overall its a good thing.  Also, Fearsome's suggestion to run zblock in addition isnt a bad suggestion either for the reasons he states.   I have run servers with plugins for a while now and I have seen servers with 4 or more running at one time with no issues whatsoever.  Plugins may have caused problems 5 or more years ago when game servers were not as powerful as they are now.  The hardware most servers employ now can more than handle a little plugin or two so I really dont see it as a big deal.<br>
<br>
I also have to agree with Chem and Val.  They invited us to play and they made many allowances for our style of play.   I think objective discussion is good and may reveal something useful, but whining about it because its not like CAL is pointless.  This isnt CAL, its CU and its their rules.  We finally have a chance to have a decent league again, lets not blow it and go off pouting because its not what we are used to.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You can go there and get the plugin as well as read about it. <br>
Basically we all know that valve never does anything to make the console variables more secure. zblock is the plugin used in CS and other source game competitive leagues to enforce many console variables. There are tons of things players can do to make themself laggy like setting their max fps really low or other net settings. zblock addresses those it also ads steam ids to the score board allows us to check on net settings of players and so on. <br>
<br>
If I was only going to run 1 plugin it would be zblock not keepers. The lag added by zblock will be minimal we ran it on our server when CAL was over and plugins were allowed and people liked it.  <br>
<br>
Also everyone stop saying CU has been running without controversy they have had plenty of controversy and plenty of arguing. Just look through their forums. <br>
And just because people have done something a certain way for a long time does not mean it is the best way. For a while CU was running without pure 2, and I remember when they made the switch to pure 2 there were a bunch of Euros who were strongly against it and plenty of discussion took place on their forums.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'll give you the only reason. Being lazy, it's a darn good one. Because if it wouldn't help our lazy asses we might not even do the work as admins at all. Imo it saves you from alot of trouble, more trouble than it makes as far a i know. About zblock if you guys want it, it can be voted for and might be implemented for upcoming seasons. <br>

To chem, we've had more bitching than you could imagine. The thing is taht it's always the same guys who bitch. Mainly people who broke the rules and then ask why they got punished. People can't ask in a nice way, instead  they go: "Fag admins you suck why the fuck do you punish me you idiots? Corupt league!?" This means they get banned for real and then we get more whining of the same sort. About pepole wanting brightskins. There was about 3 players a while ago who wanted them and it was probably at least 2 years ago it was actually allowed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

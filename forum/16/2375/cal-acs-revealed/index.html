	<div class="content"><em class="text-italics">Due to the nature of the way ACS was designed to run, ACS may inadvertently gather personal information in the form of screen captures. <br>
<br>
It is recommended that you do not visit any websites that may display personal information such as emails, bank statements, or open any other document or program that may contain information you wish to keep private, such as passwords. <br>
<br>
In a case where personal information is displayed that does not have any correlation to a match, CAL will do its best to purge these images from its database. However CAL cannot be responsible for these images or what is contained in them. CAL has gone to great lengths to ensure the security of these images, however by running the ACS client, you agree that whatever information displayed by your computer while running this client is your responsibility, and you agree not to run the ACS client if you feel your privacy is not safe. <br>
<br>
The use of the CAL ACS client is required for all matches. If you do not agree to these terms and decide not to run the client, you will not be eligible to play in CAL matches.</em><br>
<br>
In other words, it takes a screen shot every x seconds and sends it to the website. It must send them immediately because as far as I can tell it's not storing them on your HD. That would also explain why it drops my fps when running in game.  <br>
<br>
now... how do I hack into it so it sends the "I love kigha" picture instead  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Pretty useful against wallhackers I'd say. Also if you have aimbot...anything weird in your screen will get you banned I believe ;P<br>
I saw the screenshots taken from a TF2 match in a (cevo?) league. It seems it's a common method to avoid hacking....</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Apparently the hacking programs have some wierd screenshot function.  If any screenshot is taken it gives the normal image without the hacks.  I did some research and most of the hacks out there say that they are VAC and CAL ACS secure, I won't post links for obvious reasons.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

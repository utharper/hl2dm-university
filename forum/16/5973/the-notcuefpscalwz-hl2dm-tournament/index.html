	<!-- BEGIN MESSAGE -->
	<div class="content">Hey everyone. So... As most of you already know, I'm hosting a HL2DM tournament.<br>
This is NOT a CU, eFPS, CAL, or WZ inspired tournament. It will be run ENTIRELY by me and a few other trusted friends.<br>
<br>
I guess I'll get to the point. <br>
<br>
First off: PRIZE. This is going to be where first-place winner gets $2,000 USD.<br>
Now, most people find it difficult to believe that I'm actually downing 2 grand on this tournament.<br>
I will post a picture of a slip of paper from my bank account (Obviously with all personal info blurred out) showing the money I have in it.<br>
I will, at the time of the winner, be putting this 2g into PAYPAL for who ever wins.<br>
Do NOT ask me to upload ANY money to Paypal BEFORE the tournament is over for "proof." I WILL NOT upload 2 thousand dollars to an unsecured website just to let it sit there for ever.<br>
Furthermore; If you ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH to have a Paypal, do NOT bother joining the tournament UNLESS you have someone of legal age / consent to open a Paypal and retrieve the money FOR YOU.<br>
I will NOT be sending money ANY other way than Paypal. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. <br>
<br>
Secondly: ALL rules and regulations regarding the tournament will be on Facebook. I've created a separate account that you MUST ADD in order to be on the list of attendees for the tournament. <br>
<br>
Here is the FB to add: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003660440731" class="postlink">http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003660440731</a><br>
<br>
If you DO NOT have a valid FB account to add, you WILL NOT be allowed to compete in said tournament.<br>
This is for legitimacy reasoning and I am NOT willing to be persuaded otherwise. <br>
FB is a free social networking site. The chances of you not having the most popular one in the world is beyond slim. <br>
If you REALLY don't want to add your "real" account. You can do what I did. Create a separate one and add it on that. <br>
But it's really not that difficult to make one. So please add that, as I don't like posting on these sites. And I almost NEVER respond to any Steam messages until I'm already out of game (or there's a tournament match going on that I'll be on the lookout for)<br>
I will also be posting my Steal Profile on there, as well.<br>
But I must know your in-game name that you are going by, and it must be added. I will be posting / uploading the map list soon (and possibly suggestions, if anyone has any!)<br>
That is all. Thanks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Which, I would not be doing my friend Janek justice if I mention this: you should use the ag2 platform. <br>
Different game engine and different, custom, and specialized software parameters make it a much harder platform to hack.  <br>
<br>
I realize that you were always one of the bades and that this will fall on deaf ears, but as I said, I gotta mention it. <br>

You lose nothing from vavle_dm to ag2_stock, nothing at all. You only gain; provided, of course, it is a competitive setting and NOT pubby. <br>

	<div class="content">I'm sorry, I know I'm not the most trustworthy person from my past.<br>
But this is completely legitimate.<br>
And most people are welcome to join. I'm pitching in 2 grand because I have money to throw away, and I'd love to see a huge tourney again. That's why.<br>
Furthermore: I realize FB is "gay" but that is how I'm doing it. I Apologize if it makes it difficult for anyone.<br>
AG2 will not be used unless an incredible amount of people prefer it.<br>
<br>
Again: I'm not MAKING anyone partake in this tourney. If you don't want to join, then don't. Simple. I just want everyone to join and have a good time. That is all. If any other questions or concerns are to be made, please contact me via FB, Steam Profile will be on there with in-depth answers.<br>

No. That is not the reasoning.<br>

It's not hard to not bitch and whine and complain like everyone ALWAYS does about EVERYTHING. <br>
It's a little ridiculous how bad you all are when it comes to things like this. <br>
It's 2 grand. It's completely legitimate. Someone can take it or don't. <br>
You can try to not be dickfaces, but I know that would be asking too much of this community.<br>

I speak pretty well, but Kigha, you gotta disclose a lot fucking more before anyone will begin to trust you. <br>
<br>
Also, if you want to garner interest in a dead game by injecting funds into a competitive tourney, (or whatever your reasoning) why the fuck are you not donating to an established league like CU or eFPS?<br>
I have worked with *and* received prize money from Dallas, and despite him being a satanic Cowboys fan, he does NOT fuck people over.<br>
Unless I am mistaken, CU has successfully had money tourney's from donations.<br>
<br>
Both are very viable and popular establishments that have rules and community input/information methods already in-place. <br>
I am sure either will follow you condition(s) about the money, like it being for a NA tourney only, or whatever; this would be provided, of course, that your conditions are reasonable.<br>
<br>
Why are you not using an established league? What is your agenda?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Secondly, how did you get this money?  You must have a good job to have 2 grand lying around, or maybe it was a really good day in the stock market?  Just be honest, even if it's drug money or something.  Blas would still take it.  Or are you just that fucking nuts to throw away 2 grand that took like 6+ months to save from a grocery store job?<br>

Not buying it.  You literally spent years building a fake online persona only to be discovered, rage quti, and now you come back offering a few bucks for a tourney when there's only a handful of people still playing.<br>
<br>
Something doesn't add up.  If you have money to flush down a toilet, why not give it to charity or some needy family who could use it?<br>
<br>
Why use FB to set up a tournament if people are just going to make fake accounts?  That's a lot of hassle just to set up a tourney when available forums and Steam work just fine.  <br>
<br>
Your previous level of dishonesty brings me to only one conclusion: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Something is just not right here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's purely 1v1-only. No 2v2. No divisions. Just simple random seed-bracket 1v1 type of tournament. <br>
<br>
And I'm well aware that I may seem like I'm joking about this. But I'm really not. And I didn't randomly rage quti, either. I've been playing this entire time. Even after people found out. I just stopped caring about dumb shit so I stopped making a big deal about everything. lol. That's the honest truth. <br>
<br>
And as far as Steam, if everyone REALLY would prefer to use Steam, my Steam ID is "nolmts" feel free to add me. <br>
<br>
Furthermore: I'm not using an established league already because, simply put, I just don't like them.<br>
I mean, you guys literally have NO investment in this. I honestly don't know why you're making such a huge deal out of something you have to put NO money towards. <br>
Even if I DID "fake it" and pull your guys' legs, you'd still lose ABSOLUTELY nothing. So I really have no clue why it's a huge deal. Just play and have fun. But I'm definitely putting the money towards it. <br>
<br>
Might make a Steam page I guess as an alternative to this so everyone can see since FB is apparently the most difficult thing in the world to use. <br>
<br>
Anyway, add me and I'll see what I can do about page for you guys and you're more than welcome to privately message me any ON-TOPIC (again, I quote: ON TOPIC regarding the tournament) questions. I do not want any bs questions regarding anything offensive or ill-mannered, please.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yes, winner takes all. And I'm not organizing a LAN because I'm not paying for everyone's fucking flights/trips out here.<br>
I have money, I never said I was rich. Knock the LAN idea, it isn't happening. It would be major amounts of fun, but it won't happen.<br>
Plus, if people don't even trust me enough to believe I have 2k, who the fuck is going to bother travelling out ANYWHERE NEAR me for a LAN? <br>
In addition: I hate LANs anyway. <br>
<br>
I honestly have no clue why you people don't just sign up, I even made a Steam group page with a Steam ID you can add because everyone was whining about the FB thing. NOW that THAT is handled, you all complain about the money... This community is literally impossible. It is seriously impossible. It costs you all NOTHING to compete. At ALL. There's NO damage to your income to compete in this tournament. I have no clue why there's a huge deal being made from it.<br>
<br>
Either way, it still stands. And all rules are posted on the group page. Like I've said a million times, it's 2k, first place wins all, join or don't join. I'm not changing anything. <br>
<br>
The ONLY thing I'll consider changing is splitting up the 2k between 1st, 2nd, and third place. That's only if you guys want that, of course.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote><div><cite>Proctor wrote:</cite>Nicely done New Guy, you managed to make a post where you didn't run around in circles and pretend to have a point.</div></blockquote>
Being pedantic is my nature, yes. That would be the more concise and accurate term you were looking to use. <br>
On matters that I find to be of relatively greater import in this shitbag community, I consider myself thorough and perfectionist; others call it pedantic. Whatevers. <br>
<br>
You obviously garner some degree of animosity toward my posts at CU, for only on matters of mapping and the age-old OB_mod have my posts been quite-the-hefty-read on these forums; and therefore, would be the posts/rants you are referring to. The reason you don't rebutle any of my posts in their respective threads over there @ CU is the same reason you don't scrim in ag2_stock and jump to support this shady nìgger of transvestite internet-personfifed piece of cockgravey: you ain't fucking good enough. <br>
Sorry kid, Better luck next year.<br>
<br>
If Dallas or CU put up this money, we would have no questions as to "why" whatsoever.<br>
Other than the usual "why this game?" kind of questions.<br>
People would think an established game league would use it in a more popular game like tf2 or a newer one like Nexuiz.<br>
<br>
The nature of our collective questioning is not derived from the amount of money or how it was "earned." <br>
It is derived from the obvious fact (not just overwhelming opinion) that <strong class="text-strong">Kigha</strong> is in the same circle/boat of shifty cumguzzling nigmuffin shoe-shining pigfuckers as <strong class="text-strong">Panic</strong> now is. <br>
Kigha is a "classic" shifty-circlejerker. You would know this if you crawled out of those dm_sniper Pubs sooner. You support him/her/it (even though it was obvious you were trying/failing to appear *not* under her/its banner) because you and kigha are the same type of small, pathetic, palpable turds that just refuse to get flushed out of the "competitive" hl2dm scene. <br>
<br>
Instead, you're all apart of the post Oct_2010 DM shitstew. Valve already flushed this joke of a game away. <br>
That's another reason why I think a thread/idea like this stinks to high heaven.<br>
<br>
It is over. Cyn^ won. Or gay ass phantom, idk which. <br>

<br>
Nexuiz looks like a dumpy unreal tournament 3.  An established league would pick up SC2, tribes and few games that are more interesting to watch than that slug of a game tf2 and now nexiuz.  NASL is already on its way with providing all the hype and fan population needed for growth. Also, Blizzard now does there own tournaments. It's exciting to see now that social networking is allowing <br>
e-sports to grow. <br>
<br>
In short kigha does not have a website or special interest in building anything around him/her. he/she has no reason to put up this money other then to stir shit up. And like new guy said.....If he ran it through efps i would be more then happy to play and forgive him/her.  But the truth is people don't really change, kigha was a sleezeball back then and will continue to be one now.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I only promoted using ag2 as another form of hl2dm or as a secular league-based platform, which is exactly what it was made for. One should use the right tool for the job.<br>
Now I use it to test my own game theory for what will likely be a source 2011 mod. That's not a cause, it is my ambition. Nìggerfaggot.<br>
Janek did excellent work on his mod, but I was never into the ag/pro_mod stuff. The quake-style bhop code is amazing fun. <br>
Don't try to walk this intellectual tight rope and then try to pull "tl;dr" as the reason you are misunderstanding/not-caring/not-reading my past-posts and points made on said subjects, or even try to say that my posts do not "have a point."<br>
The majority of the fucking community always knows my points, especially when they don't want to. Am newguy, dumbshit. <br>
I am bull-headed and authoritative when I write, you blind cunt.<br>
Either you possess the ability to READ my stuff or you do not. Do some research before you try analyzing me. Many PhD's have, and they very much like what they see.

Listen, Kid, I meant crawl out of that secluded community of TKC and bullshit. You would have been around for how Kigha was a complete gossip dickhead-cumstain to Luke. <br>
Luke was nerd, but a good guy. I am sure Ace feels as I do, and that is a degree of shame, for rubbing it in on him. My excuse is "billy told me to."<br>

Fucking idiot. Yes, I played @ those low grav servers, for that is how I fucking knew YOU were there. <br>

</div></blockquote>
I am not a pundit for this game, I believe in real skill and I enjoy losing to phanty/grain because they have it in ag2. <br>
I was never "good" among the REAL community, but I am leagues ahead of the trash that is left.<br>
Go read my books @ CU on why the movement is now fucked in valve_dm, for I make no "name drops" idiot. My awesome arguments are my own.<br>
PB, Grain, Gina  - only in pubs talking about lawls past do I mention them (aside from Alex being uber_cute or PB being my fav_butthole on these formus.) <br>
<br>
... and mentioning Janek is name dropping? The fuck are you talking about?<br>
Janek, who I did not discover until it was far to late, was a brilliant community-oriented coder who worked his ass off for his mod.<br>
He worked REAL close with Boshed too - and I worked with abnoksious. Those guys made dm_helix and dm_airfusion respectively, both new-age, dynamic and probably the most aesthetically pleasing environments the game ever fucking knew (I still love you Valar + beef.) <br>
These gentleman are professionals who put forth their free time to make this shit, and mentioning their names and their work forces my arguments to undergo a defamation?<br>
I am now learning from these gentleman and their work so that my own works can resemble a shed of their ability and perfectionism. Fuck you, idiot cunt.

No one can be a real pundit for hl2dm gameplay. It is a random joke that had no real Game Design Theory, only re-writing the SP code 5 times over and fixes a few things for fios.<br>
I know this. You did not, but do now. But were we speaking of hl2dm gameplay? <br>
If so, I'll continue: <em class="text-italics">EDIT: LOL I LIKE RANTING <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> - and I am leaving it in, enjoy</em><br>
I used to think it was possible for my theories and ability to create a standardization of game-play the competitive-community, but even though my props formula was solid - fearsome wanted 8 different maps and 8 different games in a season. Everyone was fucked in the head back then. And that Fucked era took away the games "golden years." - Yah know, the time when you were in sniper pubs and NOT in CAL scrims and matches? MOUSE2: Idiot.cfg<br>
<br>
I used to be a "pundit" and mappers even invited me for interviews and stuffz, now I can't give much of a fuck since it has all gone to hell @ CU. Maybe I should have mentioned that before, but fuck off.<br>
<br>
I can say I know far more about what hl2dm was, is, and could have been, as well as the elements of REAL skill I have seen from players like phanty and grain, than you ever will.<br>
I also know far more about groups of players and their styles, for I categorized them, classified them.<br>
Stickers, spammers, sweepers and all that BS.<br>
<br>
Thing I failed to see years ago was that work would not be for hl2dm, but my own ambitions.<br>
Such inequity is now being rectified. No thanks to late wannabes like you.<br>
In hl2dm, I tried to find a theory in a lack therof. The random ruins it. It is why my game will have 0 random aspects.<br>
I made a solid formula for normalizing props in maps and creating a standardization of game-play in the fuckfest of hl2dm.<br>
Too bad the game was pretty dead, even by April 19th, 2007. (First day I played)<br>
<br>
In sum: I am not a pundit for hl2dm "theory" per-say - but I am for FPS game theory in general. It is now my "field" of study.<br>
Yep. Nerd. Bitches love it. And small dicks.<br>
<br>
But again, we were not getting into all of that of FPS stuff. We were taking about kigha's shiftiness and community knowledge thereof.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">I am not a pundit for hl2dm dramalore, I was just regurgitating common knowledge. Idiot.<br>
If I came across as knowing everything - it is okay - for this is true.</strong><br>
<br>
The not-pundit bit was you misunderstanding a more "concise" statement. My apologies for not being my usual thorough self.<br>
If you fail to see how a player like phanty is very much involved in "REAL" hl2dm and "REAL" skill and the knowledge gained from playing him - you really are an idiot.<br>
Forgot my own rule; never argue with an idiot, for they just bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.<br>
<br>
Good thing I know everything, so I can't lose. Awesome. <br>

	<div class="content">Kigha doing anything in this community is reason enough for us to squint our eyes and discuss wtf? or Why?<br>
Considering the amount of shifty fuckoverness (panic) this community has seen, we, I, they, anyone could question why Kigha would be selling her strap-on's or anything else.<br>
Everyone is, and should be, free to express whatever. Right?<br>
<br>
You were telling people to stop discussing the possible shadyness of Kigha, and your reasoning was that a mere 2k is not enough to warrant such a lengthy debate or discussion.<br>
You're a fucking idiot. It is kigha. If you don't think people should give a fuck about 2k, kigha, my cock, etc. then lead by example and don't give a fuck. Idiot.<br>
Not giving a fuck is done in scilence. Moron.           (like OMG - right? new insult now - yay!!!!)<br>

You don't need to say I am knowledgeable about hl2dm for it to be true. I say that myself plenty and can back it up easily.<br>
Many respectable developers within the community know of my knowledge, and know it well.<br>
If you, or anyone, cares to see how, why, and/or to what extent - I would be more than happy to oblige. <br>
Such should be painfully obvious.<br>
That is another thread/rant for another day.<br>

<br>
  I'll excuse your poofter of a mistake for now since i agree with you about most of the things you say when it comes to this DM game. However, you're wrong about saying cyn^ won. I've said this before and ill say it again since you dummies don't understand how evolution works (i'm not talking about apes to human theory).    When DM first came out, the cyn clan was able to master the fundamentals and further progress to advanced techniques before anyone else.  They were the legends, pioneers if i may.  i'll use UFC and boxing as an example. You take a look at Royce Gracy and Huhammed Ali, those 2 were able to think outside of the box to succeed the competition. When the sport progressed you would then see examples of there fighting styles all across the globe.  Through evolution comes a more technical, advanced form of fighter.    So like the fighter, the competitive players will progress.<br>
<br>
Only thing Cyn won is being able to evolve the quickest, and to this date... have the best frag video.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Obviously I am a .ewR| fanboy so I didn't want to come across as biased and shit if I mentioned them.<br>
Because of the "HE'S HACKING - WHERE IS MY TWINKIE!?!?" delay caused by Seagull, the last real season of CAL got pushed into the semester and Grain could not practice.<br>
Therefore, he couldn't apply himself to the nuances of lame outdated maps like amp, zeta, etc. and let his naturally higher talent beat $W in the post season after they once again rigged it so they could scrape in as a last seed. <br>
It still makes me LOL when I think of how they just gave up and gave away FWs after their loss to ewR.<br>
Anyways, because of all that drama, I cannot say ewR.<br>
<br>
Both Cyn^ and $w nìgger rigged their respective leagues, so I shouldn't have mentioned either. <br>
You are completely right about cyn^ - the reason I mentioned them at all is because it still kinda stings of how I let the second round of the eFPS finals slip.<br>
I should have just let billy play instead. My net was all fucked and I could not communicate with Alex, and on LD with no footsteps - it is kinda a big deal.<br>
So yah. Lame ass emo/shotgunaithez is the best team. Them faggots.<br>
<br>
Valiums is just a cheerleader though, and just smacks phantyblast on the buttocks when they head out to play.<br>

Past history has given you the answer to that question. I never once defended Kigha's character..you only accuse me of that because I never attacked him either. Common misunderstanding for narrow-minded thinkers like yourself.</div></blockquote>
Was tired &amp; busy yesterday. Here is a better response:<br>
You didn't defend her/it directly, and no one fucking would. Ever. But you were trying to get people off the idea of talking about the money. <br>
Or, you were trying to not give a fuck by giving enough a fuck too critique everyone when you should have said either "nothing" or "not that much money, I don't care about any of this and neither should you all." <br>
So either you were nonchalantly trying to get people off that Kigha hate train, or you were and idiot and moron with regards as to how one should NOT give a fuck.'<br>
<br>
So you were either being a shifty idiot or an ignorant idiot. <br>
I did assume the former, but considering how you play and scrim with that group of wannabes that kigha associates with, I really don't think I am wrong.<br>
You run in the same group as her wannabes that like the idea of competitive leagues in the broken game. <br>
I am telling you that it is REALLY dead now, so just get flushed lil turd; hl2dm is a joke and should have always been treated as such.<br>
Yes, I was once an idiot like you and took scrims and shit srsly. <br>
Thing I did not realize until relatively recently is that the best fun came from not leagues, but casual 1v1's with Grain.
<blockquote><div><cite>Proctor wrote:</cite>By me calling you out on the name dropping, I never implied that I didn't know who they were. I know who they are</div></blockquote>
The one time I dropped alex/phanty name, I was trying to convey to you that I am not someone who is a pundit for "just" hl2dm - with pages and pages of detail - but for FPS skill as a whole.<br>
I got to my self-proclaimed expert level on FPS game theory through a lot of nerd (hard) work and dedication.<br>
I won't be more widely credited as such until I finish all of my works, but until then, I can give you a private lesson if you wish. Lewl.<br>
<br>
Also you know who "they" are, and the traits and knowledge they posses? Why is it wrong to mention them? Does it hurt your butt?<br>
It is basic freshman shit. Even if you (*I*) are an accredited expert on the subject, you still bring in other "experts" into your work (term paper) to help your point.<br>
Would you bitch if I mention Edward Witten on the subject of String Theory? I gotta do it all by myself? Lonely.<br>
<br>
I was saying how I am not a pundit for hl2dm, but REAL fps skill. Grain/Phanty have it and use it well in practice. Gets it?<br>
Grain is a quintessential sweeper, Phantom - Sticker, and Billy/blast - spammers (thinkers.)<br>
<br>
I am not going into it anymore, you fail to see how I am extrapolating on ELEMENTS of hl2dm gameplay, and not the game itself.<br>
The former I am a pundit of - in all its possible definitions, but the latter - not anymore. Got it?<br>
The game itself is fucked and now even more broken. Tournament in it was a huge mistake at 100k - and still is @ any amount.<br>

Again, stop trying to tell others to not care, for the best thing to do in a free and open society when someone is screaming a message you DON'T agree with, such as posters of dead fetuses or how God kills soldiers because we let gays live/marry, is to walk on by like they ain't saying a goddamn thing.

I'd play with ya but if i crash 3 times during a game you might take the win and refuse to play me ever again.<br>
<br>
I'm surprised you played fanom the other day, you usually don't play anyone unless it's leagueplay or if you know you can win or. hence the sc2 challange. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PB's history -   Play for 6 months, starts winning here and there, starts beating good players, enters cal. Beats me by 1 point in game three. reg season stomps me in tig (smart move, i never thought you would pick a map that was never played until that season) Then plays me in lockdown, a map you never beat me at prior. I crash 3 times and you take the win and talk mad shit all over the U. Say you're the master of the universe and never/ever give anyone a shot to play you to take it away. Just the smug attacks on the U after that, So no we aren't going to play a game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What planet do you live on??? <br>
<br>
"Cyn would be Royce Gracie and he did indeed beat folks ass early on."     <br>
<br>
 Yes they slaughtered the competition, but... Royce Gracie trained in ju-jitzu before anyone else did. So that is an advantage much like the fast orb was when players first were able to utilize. Cyn mastered that before anyone else could.  Muhammed Ali took alot of punches because he knew the fighters would tire out at the end of it (which caused him alot of brain damage in the end) But nevertheless he won. Now fighters pick up on that game thanks to muhammed ali and know not to tire themselves out. People that fought Royce Gracy didn't have any defense against it so they just flopped around like a dying fish.   Just by watching them you would see that as the sport progressed the ones that followed had built on that knowledge and made themselves better fighters.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mike tyson (in his prime) would slaughter muhammed ali.<br>
Anderson silva would systematically pick apart Gracie.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The problem with you old folks is that you want to hold on to your legends.<br>
<br>
<br>
And much like your view on politics, your view is outdated. The old way is dying, something new has to replace it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Cyn^ played the same kind of old, shitty maps and game-style that $W did. And beat them. A lot.<br>
Please don't make me re-start my rant of how $W was a team that just played the odds against the 'randomness' of hl2dm rather than one that possessed elite raw skills.<br>
Cyn^ was the same deal from what demos I saw, but thy just learned the nuances faster. <br>
<br>
The lack of raw skill applies to all of those teams' members except Luke and Kurtz of course.<br>
EDIT: Lawl. I misspelled "Luke" for "Luck," and 90% of his prop kills were just that. Still a talented player though.<br>
<br>
Seagull is far from all time best. Far.<br>
It was not like he "aged" and got slower and suffered reaction time dulling (like Micheal Jordon did when he played for wizards) when both grain and billy beat him senseless in 1v1's. <br>
That is what made Seagull "focus" on a "better" game like tf2.<br>
<br>
Seagull initially pressed for grain to join Vdus, but utterly refused to play him in a tryout 1v1. Even on stock lockdown.<br>
Seagull always knew grain was more talented, and his fat ass never could get over it. <br>
And since Grain would not join Vdus and help seagull win CAL and/or eat Cheetos off his man boobs, he then began hack campaign.<br>
<br>
That's how seagull operated; if he didn't win, it had to be ill-legit.<br>
Even when he was about to lose to an ever nerdier fag like Teto he alt-tabs and ends his steam.exe process, which creates the illusion of a crash.<br>
1:37 was left and seagull was losing by 2, but never counted it as a win for teto because it was not a "complete 1v1 session."<br>

Not bad...I Agree..... few things to add in there for funzies..... LukeGT had a long period of domination but crashed and burned like tiger woods. LukeGt also was a poor loser and would not give people the benefit of map choice unless it was league play. When i played luke i had to beat him on his east server when he would never ever choose to play fair and play a westcoast server.  Seagull was better than LukeGT. Seagull would also talk shit but he was like a ghost, if you talk to all the top people in the game you would see that they never got a match with the guy 1vs1 outside of leagueplay.  So seagull never really showed himself much other then he could completely dominate in leagues. <br>
<br>
fnm is the only one that deserves respect. He plays people when asked, server and map choices don't matter. Only thing i don't like about the guy is that he backs up valiums.<br>
<br>
So i'll end it with saying there skill represents those basketball players, but there actions are not worth shiiiiiiet!<br>

"Seagull initially pressed for grain to join Vdus, but utterly refused to play him in a tryout 1v1. Even on stock lockdown.<br>
Seagull always knew grain was more talented, and his fat ass never could get over it. <br>
And since Grain would not join Vdus and help seagull win CAL and/or eat Cheetos off his man boobs, he then began hack campaign."<br>
<br>
<br>
Why you always tuggin your own teammates wankers all the time. I get it you want to be apart of something greater than yourself.  Here's the truth. Nutri was a great up and come'r (not as good of a player as poorbilly).    I was scouting nutri at the time as well, we played a couple of aim map matches maybe 5 in total, i won 2 of em. I noticed he had a great mag and had alot of potential.  I wanted to be on a team with the guy because he was looking like he had a promising mag shot that could out due mine. After playing him in regular maps you could tell he wasent much of a 1vs1 player. I'll ask it now to anyone....How many people got to play nutri one vs one other than newguy and billy, or other shitties that he could dominate. I dont even recall him being in a league outside of 2vs2 or teamplay..... So anyways back to my story......Nutri jumps in with Billy.  Much like the fearsome and lukgt combo.....We can all agree who carried who there. So here we go......... They join a league together, PB carries nutri. They win it. Pb disapears. Nutri loses to everyone in teamplay. End of story. If you want to discredit anything i have said show me the screens. i did a good job of grabbing all of them. <br>
<br>
So here's where the beef all started with nutri and I. We start having 2vs2, Blas and i vs nutri and PB.   Due to contrary belief, we didn't have have that many matches and the ones we had were pretty damn close both ways. We won a match on Lockdown and Lostvillage. They won some on those as well. But where it ended was with them slaughtering us on caverns. They completely dominated that map. but after they won being pb and nutri, they started rubbing it in. So the convo you see of me and nutri posted about nutri telling me how to work out was after that match, where we never got to play them again. <br>
<br>
<br>
"That's how seagull operated; if he didn't win, it had to be ill-legit.<br>
Even when he was about to lose to an ever nerdier fag like Teto he alt-tabs and ends his steam.exe process, which creates the illusion of a crash.<br>
1:37 was left and seagull was losing by 2, but never counted it as a win for teto because it was not a "complete 1v1 session."<br>
<br>
Yea he did that to Blas and I.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, Ace, I can't comment on your history with Nutri other than it being utterly hilarious when you threatened his life.<br>
<br>
The reason I "tug their wieners" a lot is because I did play them a lot, which was a pleasure most others didn't have (as you said,) and therefore I have a great deal more perspective on them and their styles than anyone else.<br>
<br>
Billy was ALWAYS shittier than Grain. The rivalry between themselves was actually the most heated one, in one sense or another.<br>
They never disliked one another, but also were extremely competitive amongst themselves.<br>
Billy was the same type of movement and item/map managing player as Seagull - and got better than Seagull.<br>
Poor_Billy would always admit how Grain was better, when grain was not around lol, but grain's play was always very streaky.<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Lemme Explain</span>:<br>
The problem facing grainy poo was that he never nerded (studied) hl2dm as the other "greats" did.<br>
Hell, I nerded the game more than him and only beat him like twice. <br>
Therefore, I can say that his play was based on what I refer to as "REAL" skill, or rhythm and flow. <br>
He could mesh very well, made very good decisions on the fly in combat, and yes, had a nice long-range mag. <br>
The things he did not do well are the things blast, phanty, billy, seagull, etc. (everyone else - lol) would put a paramount emphasis on: map gathering.<br>
<br>
He never wanted to be patient and actually hone such skills, if he did, he would have been the unquestioned best and maybe we would have won the eFPS 2v2.<br>
Like 4 times he would take EVERYTHING at the bathroom and be like "I got this" - "Dun wurry bout it" - then die.<br>
And I would get impatient as well and be retarded and use nades on LD. Yada-Yada.<br>
Grain is a brilliant young fellow @ UWO and that program did eat up a lot of his time, but w/e's - game is done and over. All History now.<br>
<br>
The instance in which Grain is nothing short of invincible is when he is playing me, for he is laughing, relaxed, and never fucks up. <br>
With that at his back, he is able to accidentally have control/domination of a map.<br>
Shit taking can work on grain, he is human and sometimes prone to get angry, impatient, clumsy. <br>
If he nerded and made map control second nature - he would be in same tier as phanty/Ak3d now are. <br>
<br>
Despite those flaws, he ALWAYS has a good chance to beat you and opponents have to adapt to HIS play.<br>
I am building my game around those combat-based talents that he and phanty have.<br>
<br>
1v1 anyone? all this nostalgia is making me thirsty.<br>
<br>
As far as your grain-teamplay &amp; your screenie-crap comments go - yes, you are likely correct. I can see the screens if you wish, but I don't doubt your analysis. <br>
Grain has to rely on others to keep the weapons and spam AWAY from the enemy, and he never played to win (team-wise, not individual KDR) when 2v2ing with anyone else (Rico) besides Billy.<br>
Just like he does now, ge would just smell blood and rack up the majority of kills for his team. <br>
Also, in ag2_stock (the closest thing to old-school hl2dm) I doubt that you + [even an amazing partner like phanty] could beat myself and a non-dusty Grain. <br>
Give him two weeks and a helium-filled beach ball, he'll be ready...<br>
<br>
Wanna go brah? Huh Brah? throwdown Brah? Yeah Brah. Doit. Faggot. Brah.<br>

This keeps in line with you original statement, but the reason behind it is that Grain would listen to billy more and play smarter. <br>
My net was all fucked too, bleh. If the finals were on almost any other map, we would have won. <br>
<br>
Lol, grain didn't even realize that there was 3-loose rocket ammo's on ld_r6 until I told him at like 6 min into the second round.<br>
Again, he wouldn't study. And billy's invoked-atmosphere made Grain more nerd. Hl2dm was not about "REAL" skill, it was about nuances.<br>
Ag2_stock made it slightly better with the hit_reg and better prop-client-relations, but yah, still lame randoms and geighness.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

He played leagues to win though, he didnt actually enjoy 1 vs 1 at all and so never played it outside of that, which u would know if u had talked to him aboot it. You would understand that view if u thought 1 vs 1 in hl2dm was as stupid as i do.<br>

 It turns out this time that fanom is your buddy, so i cant say you're wrong there. But the others are wack. Nutri and edge?! what the fuck planet you live on..especially edge. We already went over nutri...but edge?!<br>

Now take in consideration a 2 year absence and a 2 week return. As i recall he just stomped you in a 1 vs 1, so that shows you still don't got what it takes. I also recall beating you 5/8 games we had in teamplay. So you calling me garbage, must make you a bigger piece of garbage.   In the short time coming back i still managed to beat Blasphemy and bahlk in a game at least a few times (they won majority),also beat confused. only guy that stomped me was phantom. For 2 weeks after a 2 year break, that's pretty good if you ask me.<br>
<br>
Nutri, you were always a shit 1vs1. You took me out, and not by much on an aim map, 3 out of a 5 games?. I beat you on any regular map and no..you were not just up and coming. you already had beat top guys so quti making shit up like you're something special.  This was around the time when i beat billy in games and had just lost by 1 point to billy in game 3, after being tied. Which you were not even close to how good billy was. He carried you, end of story. Not this i gave it up bullshit. Because if we went off that info.. then i would of gave up long before billy and you.<br>
<br>
Nutri's logic.     Kurtz is the best. Kurtz stopped playing as much. Luke became the best. Luke gave up. Seagull became the best. seagull stopped playing as much. Ace became the best, Ace stopped playing as much. PB became the best. Pb stopped playing as much. Edge became the best. Edge stopped playing as much. Phantom became the best. Hmmmmm.<br>
<br>
P.S that's a whole lot of lying i see in your post. With your logic about taking it easy, then you obviously didn't beat the real seagull. Because clearly seagull was not taking the game seriously anymore, amirite?!   You fucking skinny little undercover faggot. We all know who you are nutri, i was going to leave you alone since i actually felt bad for you.<br>

" back in the hey-days could have beaten you in 1v1s. Rico, Kyle, Nino, and Ghost included". Now that's a fucking joke. <br>

<br>
<br>
I ain't the best or think that i am. I just think that i deserve some respect for beating everyone in the game(minus phantom, i have been gone for way to long to even attempt it).  But fuck you all for saying i'm shit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Edge + Myself actually beat phanty blast real bad, on fucking lockdown. Lockdown. Yah.</div></blockquote>

<br>
But who won the majority? And was it a big majority? Was it only 1 game? Where there things involved to dictate the score of the match? Lots of questions .... just saying 1 time we rocked them so that means edge must be great.<br>
<br>
If this aint the story and correct me if i'm wrong. "We beat blasphemy and phantom badly on lockdown while we played rebs and only for 1 game"  Will make you look like a moron, so i hope i am wrong with that.<br>
<br>
Here's where i base my knowledge on edge.  Edge was a backup for the clan i was in right before i quti the game 2 years ago. He was a teammate who i played 1vs1's with often. I had never lost a game to edge and was trying to teach him some more advanced skills. I knew that he had been around for a long time and would most likely not improve a whole lot. Anyways when i came back for a few weeks i played suppertime who was a member of 911. who thought edge was really good and i explained to him why i disagreed. Anyways i played suppertime 4 games and won them all. Then the next week he told me that he beat edge. So i assumed he was still at the same level of skill.Anyways short story short. I didn't and still dont think he has skill.  But again, i could be wrong since i' have been gone for so long.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

 That is just so fucking stupid it hurts. So lets take that example and run with...... Ok so cyn was hot when the game was alive, SW was hot in fios and after for a few season.

When EWR  showed up the game was already dead. You missed out on the 10 hour days of scrimming. you missed out on the leagues when it was thriving. You missed it all...So i  guess any win after that means that it didn't matter? Fuck.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Are you that fucking stupid where you cant see  i said ewr stomped us on caverns.  There is a reason why we called them the 1 map wonders.<br>

The reason we stopped playing was because u knew we could beat you guys on any map other than caverns. you guys pulled a seagull on us and instead of playing the maps that we wanted, you only wanted to play caverns.

<br>
<br>
SW on zeta was terrible. The players that played during the match were even worse. Correct me if i'm wrong here.... The roster consisted of Luke,fearsome,tlc, mario....Maybe i remember conflict playing in there.     <br>
<br>
Here's what happened with $W and blasphemy can back me up for this.    So here's a story...Blas and i used to play $W red on a regular basis(TLC,Mario) back when they were the 2nd best team in the league. We used to have some good games with them until we started to beat them on a regular basis. They gave up and played less than 10 hours a month while we only had the chance to play SW black. We played them lots and also got beat up alot...But there came a time were we beat them on a regular basis. Luke through a hissy fit because he hated losing and stopped playing us, and the game in general. Fearsome followed.   <br>
<br>
<br>
So the $W you played was a pretty damn weak one....tlc, mario, conflict, and i'll give fearsome a bit more credit and say he can play better then those 3. Anyways you played 3 washed up players that weren't even good in there prime. So beating a dead team in a dead game does make you so high and mighty. <br>
<br>
Con and constipator were nothing special. The time i quti the first time and came back. I played them both around the time you beat them. Here's what happened.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://s17.postimage.org/kp74b3959/1123123.jpg" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
<br>
I only got to play 1 game with before div rq'd<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To end my point. The game never changed for the better. It actually got worse because no one plays the game seriously anymore. The only thing i noticed for skill is phantom and maybe vapor since he took out the top prospects for the tournament. Everyone is the same or worse then they were at there prime. So maybe nutri's logic does make sense, but inadvertently discredits EWR in the process.. good job nutri.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">@ your first point: They still had Luke, and it was on a Dinosaur map like Zeta in which old-school inbreds could still remember the lame, static, and slow strategies to such a map.<br>
They game was on a trend to a standardization of play and such was reflected in the trend of maps that were produced.<br>
 Fear said it was a bad thing "all maps are starting to fit the same bill," he cried.<br>
<br>
My props formula cropped up at this time. Its embers were not given breath by league admins (fearsome) because they were all antiquated, ignorant, and asinine.<br>
Fear wanted 8 "very" different maps, and he wanted varying play. He might as well have thrown in a RP map to change it up. Very backward adminship. <br>
<br>
Again, ewR was not allowed the opportunity to show how new-school they were. Caverns is pretty bad now....<br>
EDIT: New maps were better, but no one could play them for realz. Cancer set in....<br>

Poor_Billy changed it for the better. Without him popping up, game would have died sooner. <br>
Seagull was then, and as always, never treated with a sound mind, and his antics were given too much consideration.<br>
The majority of the community lost all faith in the player-admin system after that final BS. <br>
<br>
ewR injected interest, and the ruling party's response was "death to the game."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well i disagree with alot of that. Especially taking what conflict said and running with it.. All con is good for is his creative artwork.

The new era was made when a new nerd, billy, showed people how much more fucked hl2dm was from the ground up...<br>
In other words, its base game-theory (or lack thereof) was made more apparent to all players by billy.<br>
TLC did it for orbs. Luke and lame props. Moose/fear using spam and rocket behind that, etc.<br>
Or maybe it was Cyn^ fuckers I never new, still, the shotgun was not "whored" in cramped, antiquated maps like lockdown.<br>
EDIT: It is still effective in those maps, but Billy was the one most attributed with finding that out. The idea spread like herpes in a hot-tub.<br>
<br>
The new era was also defined by knowledge passing through the whole of a community, like the intricacies of it's exploits (including the over-powered shotty,) VERY quickly as opposed to the old days. <br>
I was made "good" by this new era of knowledge-wealth and sharing. No more blast withholding fast-crawl and such.<br>
<br>
Nerds lower skill ceilings, and then the community raises them up again in response.<br>
The shotty nerding happens in more open maps where it was easier to move at higher speed when entering into combat; hence, the shotty rushing of a mag/smg_nade spammers face. <br>
Then trends move toward more balanced and new-age maps like airfusion. Shotguns became apparent as a backbone weapon. <br>
<br>
EDIT(2): But, as I said, the competitive community died before it could implement the community of developer's response to this game-changing stuff.<br>
Unlike cavs, new maps allowed both teams to have shotguns whilst dealing with the overall strategy of a given map. <br>

	<div class="content">Valiums is a part, albeit a small one, of a team that is currently the proven best @ hl2dm, in both broken'er valve_dm and ag2_stock.<br>
I was a similar small member of a team that beat you many more times that you ever beat them. <br>
If you could have beaten grainbilly in a league setting - you would have - and we all would know and acknowledge.<br>
<br>
You didn't prove shit with select screenshots. All relevant persons here have their memory, we knew and know what is up, brah.<br>
I now offer for a fun, but very competitve, old-style tourney. You don't address it.<br>
PhantyBlast would play - I would play - Grainbilly probably would - but *you* would not...<br>
Or so you told me in Steam; Quite a "man." yeah. brah.<br>
<br>
You were never apart of a team that could dominate like GrainBilly or PhantyBlast. Get over it. <br>
We are practically fucking the dead horse now. Fucking.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Inb4 you reiterate your "one map wonder" argument, in realtion to my ^statement of Grainbilly beating you more.<br>
Do re-read my previous point(s) if you feel the need to make that argument again; <br>
GrainBilly were ahead of the curve in the new-age of hl2dm, but the the game died and newer maps (minelab, air, helix) could not be used in dead leagues to prove it.<br>

<br>
Here are the facts and figures with valiums<br>
-He has never Beat me in a 1vs1<br>
-He has never even came close to beating<br>
-Even after 2 years i come back for 2 weeks and outplay him. I got screens and proof so there is no tip toeing around that.<br>
As far as being proven best , well you're a fucking illogical moron.<br>
<br>
Now on to you.<br>
<br>
"I was a similar small member of a team that beat you many more times that you ever beat them."<br>
<br>
What do you mean "MANY" We hardly played together. maybe 5 matches untill shit broke loose. We were proven to beat them or on par with them on any map other then caverns.<br>
<br>
"You didn't prove shit with select screenshots"<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll be glad to "lose" your respect after this. I don't need someone who is all over the map, you said 3 very opposing things in all of this. Stupid claims to about you being better then billy. You're all fucked up man. <br>
<br>
How many do i have to spam?<br>
<br>
PhantyBlast would play - I would play - Grainbilly probably would - but *you* would not...<br>
Or so you told me in Steam; Quite a "man." yeah. brah.<br>
<br>
What is there to prove now you fucking tool.<br>
<br>
<br>
You were never apart of a team that could dominate like GrainBilly or PhantyBlast. Get over it. <br>
We are practically fucking the dead horse now. Fucking.<br>
<br>
So i guess in the prime of the game beating seagulls team and lukes team means not dominating at all.  Take another dick you wimpy female.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sucking is just foreplay, no big deal.<br>
<br>
Yes, I was curt in my last post, but I can't be all touchy-feely-long-winded all the time.<br>
People get tired of it.<br>
<br>
Listen, you seemed to *still* be all fiery about hl2dm - and I just want to give you an canvas to express that.<br>
No, it won't be the EXACT same backdrop as hl2dm of old, but it will be close.<br>
I am not asking for anything to be proven except the "old" players can still do a tourney. Perhaps I am wrong.<br>
<br>
Please stop taking everything so personal. I still have respect for you. I still wish to give you hugs.<br>
Doesn't mean I can't tell you that your very wrong in my usually authoritative-dickhead style. Sheesh.<br>
Going up against uber-angry-prone Centers like you in my Football days is what made me create the "my penis is small" line.<br>
<br>
Yes, I do "know" more than most, but I just as flawed and fucked as anyone else: I am just a slightly different mixture. As are we all.<br>
I am the same kind of meaningless spec of dust in the vastness our universe as anyone else;<br>
We all stew in sentient ignorance as to what we are and why we exist.<br>
"My penis is small" is my 'creative' way of expressing this in a subtle manner.<br>
No one is truly "better" than anyone else in their entirety, only in specific attributes and narrow ways.<br>
<br>
The "I know everything/am better than u" attitude is my way of coating a given debate with an accelerant... <br>
Such is my way of giving breath to passion and thus forcing points to be made/addressed faster.<br>
This is America, time is money. I am not, nor will I ever, attack you personally.<br>
<br>
...Chillax brah. Never take newguy srsly.<br>
I am a seed, but you should really stop hating on eggs.<br>
They are the more valuable side of the species/relationship.<br>
<br>
Also, you would have had the opportunity to play ewR far more if the powers that be didn't go and kill the game (in a competitive, non-noob sense.)<br>
If you still care this much about hl2dm performances, just play now. It would be a good experience.<br>
Joke of a game was always a joke, and should be regarded as such.<br>
<br>
Rico's post is a marvelous example to us all.<br>

As blast, myself, and many others would say - It does not really matter what players "could" do. <br>
The 'game' was dynamic, play-styles adapted and improved. Old players would not have shit one someone like phanty/Ak3d now.<br>
Kurtz, Seagull, Billy. Nothing. Prolly not even have squat on a mediocre like me - if I applied myself movement and map theories, again.<br>
In that regard - or under those conditions - I am better than billy was, yes.<br>
<br>
This was all true, until valve removed 95% of sweeping. Final killing stroke to the "REAL" game.<br>
<br>
Now it is my goal to take those "REAL" elements and put them in a new game.<br>
One not broken. One not random. One that is Golden; "easy to learn, hard to master."<br>
I would like your input and feedback in that endeavor. I really would.<br>

Absolutely<br>
Not in starcraft, of course. <br>
<br>
This is how it goes down:<br>
ag2_stock, closest thing to classic hl2dm. We use that.<br>
I pick two maps, you pick two maps. One is a primary, other is secondary.<br>
We play our primary maps, two 10 min rounds total; since I am the one "challenging" the idea of your "Universe" title, my map/round is first.<br>
<br>
If one of us wins 2:0 in rounds, that fag gets the cash.<br>
We use Alex, Rico, or Dallas as a intermediary who holds the 200$<br>
<br>
If we tie 1:1 in terms of rounds, we look at frag scores. <br>
Whoever has the most overall frags gets to use their secondary map pick.<br>
In such a case, the winner of the third round wins the pot.<br>
<br>
In a single round, there is no such thing as a "tie," for ag2 has 5 min overtime periods.<br>
Each round is played until there is a single, leading, winner.<br>
<br>
Sound good? we can stream this too and have Rico/Alex shoutcast.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Once I get a "Yes" on this idea - I will tell you my map picks.<br>
And yes, we can play 2 rounds of the same map should we pick as such.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
We can't do what DM was, but closest thing is ag2_stock; therefore, we play that.<br>
Don't be a pussgina, and our last "spur of moment" 1v1 was in ag2, if you remember.<br>
<br>
We publicly post our respective maps 1 week early so they can be practiced. <br>
My terms are reasonable, vavle_dm - as it now sits &amp; stews - is a much different game.<br>
<br>
I don't give a fuck about that now more-lame game.<br>
The BETTER tie-breaking system only works in ag2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Shotgun works fine. <br>
It's theory and balance is the same just in a MUCH less diluted and pure hotbox system.<br>
With the alternate hit-reg, it could be very well argued that the shotty got more powerful.<br>
<br>
But you never were very good with the aiming at stuff. Not consistently anyways, despite what you may claim.<br>
<br>
You could go into options and use valve's hitreg system (within ag2) and aim you shotty like old days, or so I am told.<br>
I would never use valve's hitreg myself.<br>
Janek was particular in making hl2mp_stock the EXACT same, but the better (alternate) hitreg is "on" be default.<br>
<br>
Also. Final projects are cramping down, so I will be good to play anytime after may 9th.<br>
This will give you time to see how ag2 is better, and time for Dallas to perhaps make a steaming event.<br>

Gone. And it won't come back. I stated this well before you posted your "challenge."<br>

	<div class="content">I don't need the 200$. Its not about money anyhow.<br>
<br>
I will concede to this, though:<br>
Billy's round/map-pick is on valve_dm<br>
My round/map-pick is on Original_HL2MP<br>
<br>
Same round rules as I stated before, but with these slight changes:<br>
If billy's round is a tie, then whoever wins my round is the overall winner (no such thing as a tie-round in my platform.)<br>
If rounds are 1:1 -  whoever is leading in the combined frag scores will determine the tie-breaking round's conditions. (platform and map)<br>
<br>
Map pool will be that of CAL 1v1 2009. [ I would like this list to be confirmed by someone other than Billy or .ewR| ]<br>

aim_arena_reloaded<br>

dm_lockdown_r5<br>
dm_tigcrik_r2<br>
dm_vault<br>
dm_zeta_rc2<br>
<br>
This match (2-3 rounds) cannot be before May 13th<br>
We each announce our two picks at least one week before match date.<br>
Since Billy is challenging *me* - he announces his picks first. I follow with mine within 12 hours.<br>
I realize I said I would announce my maps first like 2 pages ago - keeping with a theme of Billy having a "Master Universe Belt" - but that was me giving some courtesy to billy, since would not stand a chance in a platform with ACCURATE hit registration. Not a chance. None.<br>
He needs a lower skill ceiling. And tampons.<br>
<br>
What will be your excuse now, Billy?<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">The Quickmeme that the Canadians are posting is horribly inaccurate - not that Quickmemes are known for being the opposite. <br>
The OB update of October 2010 greatly "altered" hl2dm, no one will argue against that - no one intelligent and correct anyway.<br>
Fast crawl doesn't even exist anymore, that was a huge aspect of quick gathering on tigcrik. That is just one example.<br>
I could post pages of how the dynamic movement was also hindered, but those are @ CU forms. Read them.<br>
<br>
Janek's software took a paramount attitude toward preserving hl2dm the way it was made by vavle, but it underwent only one DEFAULT "alteration:" <strong class="text-strong">alternate hit registration</strong>.<br>
This "alteration" <strong class="text-strong">can be removed</strong> and you use the same <strong class="text-strong">hitreg code made by valve</strong>, which was present in the source 2006 hl2dm used in CAL.<br>
<br>
Billy wants to play the hacked&amp;slashed shell of hl2dm as it sits now, even more broken than before.<br>
<br>
I would beat him at the game hl2dm was, and he knows that. <br>
That is also the point I previously made and maintained, and it had no "challenge" attached to it.<br>
Everything else is just Billy bleeding from his pussgina.<br>

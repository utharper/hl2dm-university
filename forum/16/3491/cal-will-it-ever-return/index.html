Since we're gonna play the ad hominem game, why don't we mention that you're a useless GM every time you post?  <br>
Nino's pretty much correct from what I see.  Every season I've been in has had a delay.  Two seasons with EE - both delayed.  Two seasons with ewR - both delayed.  At least you've got a legitimate excuse this season. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure">

I'll just quote what I posted months ago.  Your inability to comprehend astounds me.
<blockquote><div><cite>Uncle Rico wrote:</cite> I'm really tired of re-living this. This Para, is drama, what you had before was discussion. But for the record, those are not complete facts. <br>
8-11 Playoffs suspended<br>
8-15 Dispute filed against Grain - the email we received asked for the demos from the match being disputed and he submitted those within the time alotted. (48 hours)<br>
8-19 Another email sent from CAL requesting the demos from "the" match again. If I'm not mistaken, I'm the only member of my team to get this email. Not even Grain got it. Not until I logged into the CAL site did I see a completely different message requesting all the demos which was several days later.<br>
I still have all these emails.<br>
8-24 After several attempts to upload the demos to the CAL site, you got them from him via ftp.<br>
8-27 We're asked for missing screenshots for our 2v2 team. All of which were previously submitted via CAL's site or emailed to you after each match, but we re-submitted all of them the same day if I'm not mistaken.<br>
9-2 Playoffs resumed.<br>
I'm not sure who is resposible for sending the wrong messages, but the delay is still unacceptable. Whether it's a person or CAL's message system we'll probably never know, but if the matter is still open without a decision, and the season went on anyway, then there was no need to suspend the playoffs in the first place. This horse is dead. We've beaten the absolute fuck out of it. Let's drop the whole Grain/delay/hax/ewRareassholes/omfg nonsense.
</div></blockquote>It was never Grain's fault for the delay.  Blame on CAL's dispute system or whatever, but it wasn't him causing the delay.  Why do you keep bringing this up?<br>
<br>

You know why we pick on you, Fearsome?  Because it's easy.  It's like poking you with a stick from hundreds of miles away, and knowing full well that we're irritating the shit out of you.  Questioning your ability to be GM gets under your skin.  Why do we do such things?  Because you told us to.  Don't remember?

I don't need another account to call it how I see it.  No one here claimed this season's delay was your fault.  We compared this season to the others and pointed out how many of them have been delayed.  Apparently you were feeling guilty about something and started the flaming on nino.  <br>

I'm not the Voice of Justice.  From the few times I talked to the guy, I get the impression that his account is shared by a group of people. <br>

<br>
Didn't say anything about last season.  It was more about every season there has been some kind of delay.  Remember the Month long delay in season 2 while everyone waited for luke and seagull to play a match?   Then had to wait 3 months for the next season to start.   Always something that makes the cal season's fail. <br>
<br>
<br>
Fearsome you are the one who sent the demo request to the wrong team (WRW2).  Which was the cause for the delay.  I still don't understand how a request for <span style="text-decoration:underline">one match</span> one should assume to send every demo from the season.  Don't be mad because a higher admin stopped you from banning grain for not sending all of his demo's when only one was requested.  Then you had to send a new pm for all the demo's then got them.   I am sorry if I have been in leagues were disputes are common and know how they should be handled what is fair and which has the potential to be a setup.  Like if you suspect someone all season, you do pulls during the season not the day before playoffs. <br>
<br>
Yeah, tell people how I am no longer cal admin.  Tell them how the season was going well with many active teams <span style="text-decoration:underline">playing the game</span>.  And then I flipped out because of a month in a half delay to "review demos".   Also, tell them about how the admins  with any experience and self respect quti after that failed season.  Why don't you have a $W member take random clips out of context and try to make people think ewr hacks?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I can explain the name thing, because it happened to me too.  For some stupid reason, watching Grains demos changed my (and I assume Fearsome's) game cfg and changed not only my name to his but some of my key binds as well.  When I finally figured it out I was like WTF!<br>
<br>
Look at my consortium profile<br>
<a href="http://hl2dm-consortium.tsgk.com/index.php?mode=playerinfo&amp;player=14977" class="postlink">http://hl2dm-consortium.tsgk.com/index. ... ayer=14977</a><br>
<br>
It shows me using Grain's name on the same day as Fearsome.  8/15/08 was the when the whole cheating dispute was going on and when we were both watching demos and comparing notes.  Not a coincidence and no one is gona fucking believe that I hax no matter whose name I have because I am just not that good.  In fact they would prob say "Grain man, are you drunk?  Cause youre sucking donkey balls."<br>
<br>
That said, I will vouch for the fact that Grain had a hard time uploading the demos to the CAL site and as soon as I gave him an alternative method, he did it right away.  Also I was the one that asked for the 2v2 screens and again I will verify that they were submitted very soon after they were asked for.<br>
<br>
Honestly I agree with Rico, it is a dead fucking horse, we should all try to move past it and that includes you Fearsome.  You re-opened this can of worms with what you posted.  With all due respect STFU now, its over with.<br>
<br>
Nino, Ko-tao quti for other reasons beyond the cheating dispute and the issues with that season.  Further, I have a lot of self respect, thanks.  I just happen to disagree with how you chose to handle things.   I also disagree with Fearsome on alot of points and have had some epic debates with him on many topics.  I just dont vocalize them publically most of the time.   Beyond that, as I told you before, I still considered you a decent guy and it was nothing personal, you are the one that made it so.  I stayed because Fearsome cant do it alone, because I love this damn game, because I want to contribute and because, IMO CAL/league play is what keeps it going.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
     All of this was done during the season and long before the dispute.  All done trying to not let ewR know about.   Fearsome asked me to get Grains demos in mid-season.   The dispute was filed shortly after I tried to get a CSS admin to look at the scrim demo's and he said he wouldn't look at non-match demo's without a rcon status SS.  Which is standard in normal leagues.   So just like the ACE deal, something happen in week 2-3 and Fearsome didn't handle it until after week 8.<br>
<br>
Regardless,  with hl2dm numbers going down.  Consent league play is needed.  Long breaks are bad for any league.  Weather it is from s4 from a dispute, s3 from two teams in playoffs not playing, s2 two teams in playoffs not playing putting the season on hold for a month.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

None of us knew about the Ace issue until way after he did what he did because no one was looking for something like that.   I didnt find out about it until at least week 6 or 7 because Ko brought it to my attention around that time when he saw it.

Not exactly what I said, but dont be surprised if it goes up in flames.<br>
<br>
Just saying if we are gona do it many would want to see it done right and not some half baked, poorly planned disaster in the making.  I think to really do it right will take money and time and people willing to commit to being part of a real team that works together with no bullshit and no secrets and hidden agendas.  It would have to be an effort that spans multiple clans that agree to the above, but shit we cant get that now.<br>

Hardly a ban worthy offense either; I recommended a warning at most, but then my actual power to make important decisions for the 1v1 league was very minimal, and while i could refuse to wield the ban stick, i had no ability to prevent others from doing so.

<br>
I am actually talking up to 2 years ago.  My clan and others would just scrim for fun.  We werent in CAL, it wasnt even for bragging rights, we just got the two clans together every week or so and played a map or two for the hell of it.  Also it seemed clans were just a lot more friendly back then.  We talked to each other, posted on each others forums, played on each others servers and just generally enjoyed the game for what it was.   The rivalries (with the exception of a few epic ones (*cough* Cyn vs $W *cough*) were mostly good natured and rarely resorted to the flame fests that are so common now.  At least I never saw them.<br>
<br>
Yes I agree that without some sort of competative league, the game will not last long.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

once i had that too, i was watching a demo and after that i joined a server with the name of the player i watched.<br>

Similar happened in a previous season, where the final 2v2 match delayed everything by 3 months. If cal is going to continue as a serious league, <strong class="text-strong">this sort of bs needs to stop.<br>
</strong></div></blockquote>

That is what I was talking about originally.  Every season had some large delay.  <br>
<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Ko-Tao wrote:</cite>
<blockquote><div><cite>Paradox wrote:</cite>None of us knew about the Ace issue until way after he did what he did because no one was looking for something like that.  I didnt find out about it until at least week 6 or 7 because Ko brought it to my attention around that time when he saw it.  I am the one that told Fearsome about it, he had no knowledge prior to that.  Then there was a disagreement on who should handle it and how it should be handled, which caused the delay for a week or so.</div></blockquote>
Hardly a ban worthy offense either; I recommended a warning at most, but then my actual power to make important decisions for the 1v1 league was very minimal, and while i could refuse to wield the ban stick, i had no ability to prevent others from doing so. Also, the minimal delay was far less an issue than the bans effect on the playoffs.</div></blockquote>

I guess I was special because I was in IRC with everyone when ACE clearly stated he posted the pic of the luke kigha thing on the Forfeit against fearsome.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

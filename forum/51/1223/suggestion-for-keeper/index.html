Reason i say this, is i hear ppl turn off ambient sounds so they can hear better, this one reason is good enough but im sure it would be usefull for alot of things, could possibly be used to stop certain kinds of cheating...even just not letting dxlevel to be customised...woh'ever ya know, DO IT! ^_^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Like i said though, could come in handy, if i was running a server im sure my imagination would spark off some more ideas, and stumble onto some, there are surely other uses i think.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

that is such bs i lived on dx7 for 2 years and all it does is make props fade over distance so if you were to create a wall that was a solid prop yeah it would cause a wall hacking effect but since it is a prop its only faded and still cannot shoot some1 and if your within a few feet of it it becomes solid i cant count how many times i died from not seeing a prop 3 feet from me in lockdown</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I tried dx7 for like 10 minutes with my old crappy card and yeah everything was legit but the physics do what neo said, and I couldn't get used to it, like physics just appear flying at you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@nino, no that's a client thing.  You can't create screens from the server.  Would make some admin functions easier, but oh well...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Speaking of joining upon connect:<br>
<br>
I was thinking that it's a fact that people DO crash/disconnect during matches, and if you reconnect you currently end up as spectator. It would be very cool if you (keeper) could make it so that you're put in your team right away. Don't know if it's possible to do this via some kind of flag where any SteamID that were in a team upon match start will autojoin the correct team upon reconnect, whereas everyone else ends up as spectator? Or maybe anyone who via score restore has a score different from that of a spectator? That way it would work even if a player is replaced mid-game, and then this new player disconnects for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
And yeah, I should probably have posted this in the keeper's plugin topic <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
edit: actually, I'll post this in a slightly expanded version in the released plugin forum.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

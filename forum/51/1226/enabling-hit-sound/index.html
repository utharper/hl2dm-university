	<div class="content">Is there a way to enable the hit sound through the console or must this be done through a plugin?  I REALLY enjoy playing with the hit sound, because I am always fooled by the blood when I get a hit that doesn't register.  I don't know shit about plugins, but it seems that people really don't want to see them on servers.  I've also heard that keepers plugins are well optimized, so my question is will a well optimized plugin still negatively effect the performance of my server?  I've played on servers with mani (which apparently is terrible) and not had lag probs, so would someone mind enlightening me?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Mine just hacks one variable and I put very little in the routine that calculates ever game tick.<br>

I have several in the works for the orange box.  One is the headshot/sounds type plugin.  One is a pure admin plugin.  One will be a match mode/gametype plugin.<br>
<br>
I'm going to put the hitsound in the pure as well as the sounds one.<br>
<br>
But no, you cannot do that without a plugin.  I've sent a bunch of code changes to VALVe in the hopes that headshots and hitsounds could make it to the orange box.

	<div class="content">i was gonna say the hit sound would be nice for all weps, but then I thought about it for a sec and it wouldn't work for competative play. (no plugins in CAL anyway right?)  if you bounced a nade around a corner with the hit sound on all weps if that nade did dmg you would know some one was around that corner.  Except it would be nice to hear if your xbow did dmg on a bounce shot or something like that.  but then i guess that would give you the same advantage as the nade so nvm lol.<br>
<br>
It seems kinda ridiculous to me that hit sounds haven't been implemented in competative play yet.  I mean with all the hit reg issues people gripe about, hit sounds seem like the obvious solution.  I dub this a "Heres your sign" moment for the competative community.  I'm sure some one can enlighten me as to why such an obvious quick fix hasn't been put into use.<br>

	<div class="content">Yeah, I have had this discussion with a few people now. Definitely hitscan only, anything else changes the game. Splash weapons mean you can spam and listen to locate your opponent. Xbow also changes things, such as spammed bank shots in lockdown and biohazard.<br>

I do get frustrated sometimes when a displacement or stairs reduce splash damage on explosives, but it is nothing compared to the frustration caused by hit reg issues on hitscan.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So i mean hit sounds solve the hit reg problem...at least they improve it, but they aren't used in competition?  I'm very curious about this, if anyone has any insight or knows the actuall reason please enlighten me.  I'm guessing its because of people aversion to plugins, but if keeper has such a non invasive plugin that only effects gameplay for the better, whats the sense in not using it?  I can't see how a plugin with such a small foot print could effect gameplay to such an extent that the gain provided by the hits sounds is out-weighed by performance loss.  <br>

I want something that does as little as possible for the highest gain, which right now seems like just implementing hit scan sounds.  Besides when someone is hit with the xbow if they're bhoping usually the momentum of the bolt effects the players trajectory.  So if they are in your line of sight, you'll see them stop, bounce into the air a little, or accelerate, letting you know you got a hit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's done, but it won't work.  Not 100% anyway.  It might be better than nothing tho.<br>
<br>
In the game events, when a person gets hurt, the engine returns 3 variables.  Attacker, Victim, and Health of the victim remaining.<br>
<br>
From the attacker, I can access the gun being used.  but if you hit somebody with a combine ball or a smg1 grenade it will still buzz because you're holding a hitscan weapon.  Or if you lob a grenade somewhere and then switch to the mag before it goes off, you'll get a buzz because again, you are holding a hitscan weapon when the damage is done.<br>
<br>
For the most part tho, it will be accurate.  The question is, will it be accurate enough to use?  All they have to do is add one line of code when they fire off the player_hurt event and I can get it 100% accurate.  This is frustrating on my part.  So many things are like this.  I can grab the info I need out of memory, but that won't be a pure plugin.  I can also monitor health on each player hurt, but that might suck some power out of the server when it gets full.  A 1v1 tho wouldn't harm it at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

How do we know that is the only 1 your are running and that it is indeed the one we have approved. The only time we may consider it is if it will solve cheating issues. The second is it allows anyone with to run a server with the CAL config and have it be legal. This is a simplicity issue which is a main reason we do not use a pro mod. What you get from valve will work. If we do plugins then we have to force everyone to install them and add another layer of problem getting people to have CAL legal servers. As it is people just don't seem to get even the basic source TV rules and have them implemented right. If we were getting ready to go that way then we would have to consider going with a mod like pro mod and getting real fixes by working with the dev team. In addition I believe that the risk of not knowing if you hit is a tactical part of the game. When we start introducing the ability to know if you were hit, and if it was a head shot some of the alot of the risks involved with deciding to chase a person disappear. <br>
<br>
Practice on servers with hit sounds to get a feel for where to aim. And you will start to know more if you hit or not. But during CAL matches we stick with a standard valve server.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What most argue is that it shows blood splatter, when there is in fact no hit.  The hitsound was put in my plugin to allow an audio cue to ensure you acutally hit the person.  If there were no blood splatter on hits then I think there would be no need for hitsounds.<br>

In any event, I can see your points on server consistency.  Sometimes I wish I could work for VALVe to add some of these things the communities want without adding complexity to the game.

How do you tell if a server is plugin free? Is there some variable that disables all plugins, or something that reports it?<br>
<br>
I agree it changes play, I think it improves things. I am tired of watching mag round after mag round hit the rag doll on my screen, splattering blood all over the floor or wall, only to be told by my opponent that one or none of my shots landed. At least with hitsounds I would have some feedback telling me not to chase my opponent because they are not hurt at all, whereas I am at half health.<br>

If you have access to the console, then plugin_print works.  Other than that, I can make any of my plugins invisible to the user.  I could do stuff that would give the host server advantage ( 1/2 hit damage, increased weapon damage, better spam weapon accuracy ).  None of it would be detectable in the startup of the server or any of the variables.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Have you downloaded the Source SDK yet?  In there you can create a mod.  I would do the "Source Code Only" option.  In there there is an example plugin that you can follow to get started.<br>

	<div class="content">Well,for pubs, I can do a safe "hack" version that gets that extra little bit of info.  Then it would be 100%.<br>
<br>
The hack technique I use hasn't caused a server to crash since I released it over a year ago.  And that's with updates from VALVe too.  So it's pretty stable.  I use a real time search to find a variable rather than hardcoding it's position in the program.  If it doesn't find the variable, then the plugin continues without that functionality <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Haven't been getting onto the U as much as I would like.  Awesome Keeper thanks alot for going to all that trouble to make a hit sound plugin.  I would love to put that on my server and do some extensive play testing on it for yah.  I'm an uber noob though so if some one could please explain the procedure of loading a plugin onto a game server that would be MUCH appreciated.  For pubs it doesn't bother me at all to get a little more info for a trade off of having the plugin runn 100% of the time.  Reliable hit sound is SO worth a little extra "spoiler" information.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hahahah, Iam doing a robosumo project, the "NQC" code is sooo damn similar to C++, thats why they call it Not quite C.<br>
<br>
Anyways, to make it CAL legit, why not give CAL officials your source code, and then tell them to compile it. That why the only argument they may have is "Opps i dont know shit when it comes to computer programming".<br>
<br>
Or option 2 : Screw CAL start up a better league here.<br>
<br>
<br>
My opinion is very subjective.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The reason Fearsome gave for not running any plugin, even ones that would benefit the game, is that it would be one more recuirement you would need to load onto your serevr to have a CAL rdy server.  I guess people ahve enough trouble just loading the CAL config and source TV settings onto their server, and the CAL officials feel it would better not to further complicate the process.  But imo when the gain out weighs the hassel of setting it up its worth it.  Meh, I see where their coming from though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

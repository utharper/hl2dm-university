	<div class="content">I think this would be a good idea for this site.<br>
As we have many players visit the site from different backgrounds and skills, This would be just another way for players to get deeper into the game and have a lot more training from clan members fragging together then just jumping on here whenever a question comes up.<br>
<br>
So overall it would help Free agents get a team and teams that are in need of players to get them.  And with a full forum it would be 1000% better then on thread as is on the cal site.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Thats an awesome idea.  Instead of it all being on one thread, each clan and free agent would have their own thread.  I think this could have the potential of not only making it easier for people who want a clan/team to find one, but more importantly  increase the amount of clans/teams out there.  This would make it much easier to start a team, because you would have a list of all the free agents.  Instead of having to find players in game you could just setup tryouts off the list, it would be great!!  This idea definetly sounds like a keeper!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You probably did, they stole your idea, made it better, and gained on it. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> lol nah just we have good free thinkers in here. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

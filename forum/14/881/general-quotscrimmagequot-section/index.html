	<div class="content">That has different breakdowns? i.e. we have the "Scrimmages" forum or whatever. And then under topics say 1 v 1, 2 v 2, 3, v 3, and 4 v 4 and one for clans interested in clan matches. So we know who is interested in what? I know some people really like 1 v 1 and  2 v 2, so we know where everyone lies and so that everytime we want a 1 v 1 or  2 v 2, we have a sticky post where we go and look up names of who likes what? Just an idea to help get some practice time faster and so we know who likes what.<br>

lol If I confused anyone I can explain in better detail possibly with an example.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, the forum is quite big now. Then again, we are trying to do a lot of stuff here, and it offers a lot for visitors to explore...so...I don't mind so much.<br>
<br>
Forums with 1 general dicussion and a few special sections that never see posts are worse.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I dont think a "post here for a scrim" section works that well based on past experience with forums. I would prefer to just direct players to the <strong class="text-strong">#hl2dm</strong> IRC channel where you can ask for a match in real time. That is mainly what it is for after all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It's not really to get scrims, it's to know who wants to scrim and what level (2 v 2 etc,)<br>

I mean even if we asked everyone to put it on their profile it would be nice. Just something so when we're bored and looking for a game we can ask someone for a 1 v 1 and 2 v 2.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Cyber, you can hit me up with a request anytime I'm online Steam.  I don't IRC...yet.  Still debating that idea.  I basically suck, have never played anything below a 4 vs 4 (mostly Clan Matches) and have no admin authority on any servers.  <br>
<br>
But I'm game for a try.  If you have specific tactics or strategies you want work on, I'm a good sudent and don't really care how often I die.  I'll team up with anyone and be the sacrificial lamb.  But you'll have to provide the server.  Same goes for any of ya'll.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I have admin on STK servers 1-4 (4 is bug and 3 is low grav, 1 is pub and 2 is TDm so 2 is probably best) so yeah I think I have you added on friends. Or anytime you wanna play just jump in. Also we're welcome to clan matches if you guys are interested <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

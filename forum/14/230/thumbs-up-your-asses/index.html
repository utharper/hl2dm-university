I posted an announcement on how to affiliate, I dont recall getting an email from you. I apologize if you sent it and it was overlooked.<br>

The front page news is not really used for anything except major announcements, most items will be found here in the forums in the admin announcements section. <br>
<br>
So what's going on? Well, currently a new course on frag video making is being written, we are discussing hosting a map making competition and trying to come up with prizes, and we are looking into implementing a bug tracking system. Unfortunately some of this is behind the scenes stuff, so it is quite transparent, you will just have to take our word for it that we are moving forward on various things.<br>
<br>
The other factor is that no single individual is working on this site full time. We are all just regular gamers like yourself. The whole concept of the site is that it is made by the community for the community. If there is anything you want to do to help, feel free to contact me and let me know. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>

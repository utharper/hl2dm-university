	<div class="content">hello everyone, <br>
since there is a thread about active clans in the wiki I thought starting a thread for the map list:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/wiki/index.php?title=List_of_Maps" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/wiki/in ... st_of_Maps</a><br>
<br>
I like the idea collecting detailed information about the maps, think this will help newcomers and also people who never played map xy yet.<br>
Now I'm not informed how this wiki works, can everyone edit the wiki pages or is it ristricted to the administrators?<br>
<br>
at the discussion page I saw a kind of template (by Pig Popper) what information are needed:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>
1. Map name:<br>
<br>
2. Map size:<br>
<br>
3. Author:<br>
<br>
4. Brief description:<br>
<br>
5. Pictures :<br>
<br>
    Thumbnails only? <br>
    Minimum of 4 Pictures; <br>
    pictures without hud infomation<br>
<br>
            * "cl_drawhud 0"<br>
            * "crosshair 0"<br>
            * "impulse 200" <br>
<br>
6. Download location:<br>
<br>
7. Relevant website/link: 
</div></blockquote>

maybe we can use this thread, where everyone who wants can pickup a map and collect the needed stuff? so the administrators can paste it to the wiki.<br>
or how was it planned?<br>
<br>
I would like to do this for some maps. furthermore some time ago I made some overviews for the new members in the clan, so they can learn how we call the single mapareas:<br>

	<div class="content">@ Grape: most stock maps are best described as "Control" maps as they usualy have a control area. KOTH is also a contol map for that matter however the term "Control" is a more comprehensive one. moreover, KOTH is usualy associated with fast paced arenas that are less laiden with details, are much more opened and the KOTH element is more or less the main feature ...<br>

<br>
IMO it might be best to leave out stuff like what weapons are being used in the map, if and how many team spawn points or spawn points at all for that matter. i don't see how that helps understanding anything about a map. i suggest we do this:<br>

Since team play is what I've been dissecting lately, I've naturally considered maps from this point of view. Maybe you'd want to mention if the map is mainly team play and/or ffa oriented.<br>
In the above template I think Theme could be a subsection of Description rather. Maybe extend to something like this, building on both yours and Swot's examples:<br>

<ul>
<li>In info box:<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Name</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Author</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Release date</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Size (MB)</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Type</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">Number of players</strong><br>
<br>
Brief description followed by Contents<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Detailed description</strong>
<ul><li><em class="text-italics">Theme:</em> custom textures?<br>
<em class="text-italics">Size:</em> (ties in with No. of players)<br>
<em class="text-italics">Performance:</em> How taxing is the map for the computer? Is HDR used?<br>
<em class="text-italics">Flow:</em> a map in which you can move around quickly between key areas has a high flow, whereas a map cluttered with debris, narrow passages, ladders,etc. while lacking interconnecting passages and teleports lacks in flow.<br>
<em class="text-italics">Weapons, items and props:</em><br>
<em class="text-italics">Spawn points:</em> Number, Team based?<br>
<em class="text-italics">Secrets:</em><br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">For team play only</span><br>
<em class="text-italics">Balance:</em> by a balanced map I do not mean one that is symmetric in design, but one where weapon and item placement promotes a balance between technical and tactical skills.<br>
<em class="text-italics">Control index:</em> ranging from 1-5, this is a value that reflects how readily a map have something both worth and possible to control. In one end of the extreme you will find maps that end up in a campfest, like dm_powerhouse (index value 5), while the opposite is nonstop action with little to no thought involved such as a typical killbox (index value 1). However, for our purposes, a better example of a low value would be dm_lostvillage if played without the rpg (index value 2). In general, for any map, the control index will increase with the number of players, since fewer resources per player means greater potential for successful control.</li>
</ul>
<strong class="text-strong">Strategy and tactics</strong> I think we should consider that any tactical guide to a specific map could be considered part of the official curriculum here at HL2DMU. And I think the wiki is a perfect place for this, possibly with links under Stage 4 on the curriculum page if the guide in question is approved in some kind of review process. I don't see why we couldn't have several guides for the same map, officially approved or not, by different authors.<br>
You have to take into consideration, also, that tactics are somewhat dependent on number of players and ff on/off.<br>
Here you could also describe the map further:<ul>
<li><em class="text-italics">Control points</em>: these are built around items of high value, e.g. the rpg platform on dm_powerhouse or the items under the stairs on dm_lockdown (2 smg nades, 2 health packs, 1 orb &amp; 1 shotgun). Could even be an area with an unusually high concentration of spawn points.<br>
<em class="text-italics">Choke points</em>: points of a map which you almost certainly have to pass in order to get to another area, especially important if that area contains a control point.<br>
<em class="text-italics">Crossroads</em>: areas which can be accessed from three or more paths, making anyone there unusually susceptible to crossfire.</li>
</ul>
<strong class="text-strong">Tips &amp; tricks</strong> Like xbow and orb bounces or special jumps.<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Bugs &amp; exploits</strong> E.g. charging from under the supercharger on lockdown<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Gallery</strong> Including an overview with suggested place names?<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Download URL</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">External links</strong></li>

Have a seperate section for competition maps (might be confusing if someone doesnt know its a competition map) where that sort of thing is discussed in detail.<br>

Do a seperate series on competative play featuring the competative maps.<br>

I would favor the latter option and just keep the map wiki as basic info on all the maps.</div></blockquote>

So, basically, keep the parts that could be considered official curriculum (Stage 4 is kinda advanced I guess) on pages of their own. I think they should still be linked from both the basic map page as well as the curriculum page, since I believe that the wiki would be perfect for getting as much contribution as possible even with this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Hm, yeah, I guess some of this more advanced stuff is part of both of those categories. Keep in mind, though, that some of it is more general in that it doesn't necessarily refer to any special kind of play mode (team, ctf, 1on1, ffa).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah true. Actually, just have at it, I can use the Wiki to develop the curriculum even more. The idea of the courses is to cut to the heart of the matter and give people learning core material that will help them. The wiki is sure to be more extensive.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

It honestly depends on the teacher. I've had short 1 page papers and I've had 7-10 page papers. It depends on how often they are due and what the class is for. Right now the most I will have to due for any class is a 4 pager 3 times</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Not only that but it defeats the purpose unless the euros are speaking something other then english a major goal of the U is to unify people and standardize things. Just pick 1 set and make sure the names are short so they can be quickly said over a team speak.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

as I saw 50% of the listed maps got the basic template now. more work will be stuff like writing strategies etc.<br>
but that is how a wiki works - it won't be finished overnight. we should complete it step by step <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

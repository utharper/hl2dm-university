	<div class="content">i think you've covered all the ways you can say the samething.  poor kids.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Member Rules:<br>
<br>
1. Never Mis-Treat other players, whether they be in the .:|T§W|:.Clan or not, be patient with people, not everyone may be as good as you.<br>
<br>
2. Never lose control of your frustrations or anger. Never ever lash out against another player. Always maintain an attitude of moderation. <br>
By loosing your cool, you hurt the image of the clan and our servers.<br>
<br>
3. Respect all members/players as is their due. All players are due at least a small degree of respect as long as they abide by the rules. <br>
Never allow or participate in discussions on servers that might make other players feel uncomfortable.<br>
<br>
4. Try to help new players, not belittle or frustrate them. Never put down a player who is trying to learn. <br>
Always remember that at one time you were that new player.<br>
<br>
5. Never at anytime, insult or dishonor yourself or this clan out of ignorance or anger on any server or any forum.<br>
<br>
6. If you have an issue with another player, talk to them about it, don't lash out at each other on the servers, <br>
you make people not feel welcome. If you refuse to talk to the person your in a fued with, post it on the forums.<br>
<br>
6. Always remember to some this is more than a game. Present yourself as you wish others to present themselves to you: With honor.<br>
<br>
7. Always try to welcome players that enter our servers and others with a simple “Hey”. Always depart a game or server with a “gg”.<br>
<br>
8. It is mandatory for ALL members to wear their .:|T§W|:.Tag with honor, we aren't another group of kids that want to have a name. <br>
This is a dedicated clan, and if you don't wear the tag proudly, then you won't wear one at all.<br>
Should some event occur that requires you to momentarily remove your tag, you may do so, however, these situations should be kept <br>
to an absolute minimal, and always remember to put your tag back on before you leave HL2DM</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">please rethink the server config used on your CAL (normal gravity) server.  i popped in to see how smooth it was and found it to be extremely jerky for me.  my personal config is rate 100000, cl_updaterate 100, and cl_cmdrate 100.  the best i could get on your server was:<br>
<br>
max rate was 30000<br>
max cl_updaterate was 60<br>
max cl_cmdrate was 100<br>
<br>
at least make the update and cmd max rates the same.  doesnt matter if you choose 100 or 67 or whatever.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

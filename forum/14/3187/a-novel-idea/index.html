	<div class="content">Let me attempt to use different words to get my point accross;<br>
<br>
	Half-Life 2: Deathmatch University should not be your only stop in your quest to beccoming a better player and should be used as a tool only. It is a good resource for information but it needs to used in conjunction with a boot camp that should be used in conjunction with a powerful tool; Common Sense. "Boot Camp" can be as simple as pressing escape and studying your control's. Walking, Running, Crouching, Sprinting, Aiming and Shooting  are all basic movement teqniques every player should master on there own before they try and tackle more advanced multi-player feats of coordination like "bunny hoping" and "grav jumping". The only way to truly master any teqnique is to do it over and over and over again and that can only be done with time. The end result of the U is players that lack the information and education to inteligently defeat there opponents on the battlefield provided by valve and lack the basic knowledge and skill to manipulate there character on the screen. Take a look how the military trains new rectruits. Everyone starts at the bottom and works there way up slowly getting educated on how the system and the world around them works until they are fully trained and profficient in every aspect of there job. Its called proffessionalism and the same logic can be applied to your game and every aspect of your life. <br>
<br>
	 The "Rules" of the game are simple; Kill or be killed and use the tools given to you  to the best of your ability and have fun. The original Half-Life DM was simply the multi-player function for a single player game and not stand alone. Again the rules were simple; Kill or be killed using the tools and teqniques you have mastered while playing the single player game. Half-Life 2: Deathmatch takes those same fundementals; use the tools and teqniques you learned in the single player game and apply them in the field against your friends.The logic behind that is to make sure you have the basic knowledge and skills to at least be able to function in the single player environment before you graduate to the more advanced concepts and movement teqniques in deathmatch. Left 4 Dead takes those same aspects of survival and the kill or be killed atmosphere of DM and the single player aspects of the half-life series and blends them all together. Communication, Coordination, Teamwork and common sense are essencial or you will fail.  You don't know how to play? Play the single player, learn how to move shoot and aim, and then try your luck in the field.The U seems to want to get players ready and interested in the CAL aspects of gameplay only. You have attemped and failed to turn deathmatch into a sport and tried to apply sportsman like behavior into a war zone and change the roots of deathmatch and coincidentaly seem to have lost track of what the game is about; Killing your friends and having fun in an environment with no rules.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Preparing players for CAL was never the goal. Just because people involved in CAL have chosen to get involved with DMU doesn't mean that is the mission of the site.

Regarding sportsmanship, most competitive players prefer to play with a minimum of rules. It is actually the clans and various admins that try to enforce sportsman like behavior in game (no spawn killing, no killing afks, no spamming rpg/orbs/smg nades). Sportsmanship here at the U amounts to this: don't cry when you die, you will respawn in just a second!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Where do we claim that we are? The whole purpose of this site is to try to get people who still prefer to play dm together.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately many people who come here see only what they choose to see (elitism, exploiters, anti-fun, not enough moderation, too much moderation, anti killbox, anti-low grav) but again they are missing the point, and / or mistake individual players expressing their opinion for the values of the site itself.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The attitudes of everyone here that decides to post. No one here knows what DM is about and I honestly think if you are trying to promote and train new players you are going about it the wrong way Hence the lack of support or interest in your site by anyone not in CAL or not totally new to DM. I've been around for a very very long time and CAL is not DM. Cal is a seperate entity and should be treated as such. Your new players think CAL is part of this game when in fact its an off shoot if the original concept and adding rules and regualtions to a game that has none and they are going out and spreading there new rules around as fact and imposing those rules on anyone that they come up against. That is absurd.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sean: I don't get your point here. This site is here to support HL2DM, the game.<br>
That includes TDM, DM 1 v 1...<br>
It is here to be a resource for players, nothing more.<br>
You say CAL is not DM?!?!<br>
Well it is TDM and 1 v 1 competition.<br>
What else is it supposed to be?<br>
Maybe you could build a DM site, where folks enter and fill a 10 man server and slug it out and results posted on the site. Nothing stops you from doing this.<br>
<br>
The U has a training server, Trainers, demos, tips... etc.<br>
A lot of the folks here help noobs all the time, if they want.<br>
<br>
Maybe you could articulate what it is that you are hinting at, like Boot Camp.<br>
Maybe you have not stated your ideas well enough, rather than the folks here are close minded.<br>
<br>
DM, as originally intended is a server full of people, map changes, Map ends, someone has the highest score and wins, next. Nothing more.<br>
CAL is an attempt to expand the game and this is a BAD thing?!?!?!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have alot of Idea's and teqniques and tricks that I have learned in over 10 years of playing the half-life universe. I am by no mean's ever done learning new things in this game and I'm not claiming I am the best I am just offering what I can to the table. I know what works and I know how to make it happen the most effecient way I know possible. I can break it down step by step for you and tell you what works personally for me. It will just take me some time to formulate all of my Idea's into something easily understood and containing the points I want to get accross. I was expecting hostilities from everyone so I have not started on that project yet but I am willing and able and I have nothing but time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This being a haven for everything to do with CAL I assumed the source of that thinking came from here and perhaps I could shed some light on how someone could be so mis-informed. So I posted what I  thought the roots of DM were to me and gave my two cents on what I thought of the U's approach on things. And you are right, no one is forcing me to come here since I was attempting to have a rational discussion about my thoughts and idea's. No one is forcing you to contribute.</div></blockquote>

you're right, nobody is forcing me to contribute, i do it of my own free will, but i dont complain about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
	  Since Half-Life 2: Deathmatch was released as a stand alone from the game its easy to forget that some players have never actually learned how to move the mouse or fire a weapon in the game. My goal is to educate players that are new to the Half-Life universe<em class="text-italics">(New to the universe meaning never touched the single player game)</em> in basic movement teqniques and to familiarize and prepare the player to face  the many chalenges that he will face in the world of deathmatch. Luckily the folks at Valve have already come up with a solution for introducing there players into there world. If you remember when you played the first Half-Life they had the "Hazard Course" to help familiarize all of us new to Half-Life how to play. The crouch jump and the long jump were essential skills to master if you hoped to survive or even complete the game. Again in Half-Life 2, at the begining of the game new players were forced to familiarize themselves with basic movement teqniques or fail to move on. By releasing DM by itself and leaving out that critical step of familiarization and easy to follow instructions it's no wonder that there are so many clueless people out there. I plan to fix that and I think a "Boot Camp" map designed to show you everything from how to move left and right all the way up to the most advanced teqniques should do nicely. Learn to crawl, walk and then run is a pretty solid teqnique and keep it simple stupid are good rules to follow when designing a map for this particular project. Remeber the single player games already do this for us we just need to take the important basic elements from them all and then add all of the advanced movement teqniques as a seperate map after you have mastered the basics and "graduate".  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":idea:" title="Idea"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

ill admit this isnt a bad idea, and i applaud your efforts to help new players......BUT, if you havent noticed there's not an overwelming amount of ppl just joining this game.  i think you are going to end up helping a bunch of CSS players for a couple of weeks until they decide they dont like all the movement shit they have to learn and then quti.  i hope im wrong tho, cause this game does need some fresh blood.  good luck with this bro, and i really mean that, im not being sarcastic.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here is my solution to that. I will only help people that want  and seek it. I'm offering it as a resource for players because they didnt have it before. Think about it a little. WHY would new players not come to this game? Because there is no introduction and no one telling them whats going on around them. You are left to figure shit out on your own and no one is helping anyone along. The attitudes of the vetran players are to rape "Noobs" and "Own"  and that is certainly your perogative. I've been playing this game since I was 14 and I've had alot of time to think about "Half-Life" and what makes a good it a good game. However, since Deathmatch was released it was done so at first bundled with your purchase of HL and then as a stand alone by itself with no introduction and assuming new players have actually played the single player. You guys wanted Ideas and suggestions on how to improve your  site and get more players actually in this game. Teach them, this is a "University" and its board memebers should actually believe in the things they are speaking about other wise I can really just as easily design and launch my own approach to DM's problems and actually solve the ones at hand. Perhaps you don't have the time and thats totally fine because I have nothing but time to sit down and think about the worlds problems and come up with solutions. At least all of the MODS that were released assumed you have never touched a mouse and keyboard at first and I'm pretty sure Valve did this all to themselves by releasing a stand alone game with no introduction and no help  for new players. I love this game and I always will and I'll put in the time and effort to teach new players and I will gather those around me that feel the same way.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">To be honest i dont think any of us know your point.  you just randomly started on this rant about helping ppl learn the game.  as with any game, it has evolved.  im not sure how you are planing on helping new comers by showing them "the roots".  i can kinda see where you are going with that but, it makes so fucking sense. what is your goal for this learn the roots mission? this is like showing somebody who wants to learn to drive, how the cave man came up with the wheel.  teaching somebody how to roll a circular shaped stone down a hill, when the person is looking to learn how to work a clutch.  in this day and age, anybody who is playing online games knows the basic movement priciples like wasd, space=jump, how to crouch, how to sprint, thats a given to PC gamers now.  so your root mission is pretty much a waste of time, unless you plan on teaching ppl who just bought a computer and somehow decided to buy an old game like hl2dm how to get started.  <br>

Dont come here bashing us and DMU, there are links to trainers here, there are frag vids, tutorials, manuals, documents on strategy, league info, etc.  dont start a thread and tell us who can reply to it, saying only adults can when you yourself are acting like a child.  <br>

well i think the issue is the aggresive, offensive manner in which you presented your idea, not the idea itself.  as far as what im contributing:<br>
<br>
i have never said "no" to anybody who asked me for help. <br>
i became a CAL admin to try and help improve the way the league is run. <br>
i am helping Dallas out with his warzone league to give players another choice for league play.<br>
im an active member of this community who helps out anybody in any way that i can.  <br>
im a true friend and clanmate to many.  <br>
i run my own server for my clan, so that EE can have another server for matches.  <br>
i stick up for ppl who are good ppl and are getting the shit end of the stick at certain times.<br>
i made EE hats for my clan and mailed them to the members<br>
i am currently planning an EE LAN party in VA beach<br>
<br>
other little things from time to time, but im not sure why this is of concern to you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

However there are those of us that do take new people and try to teach them.  Mliquid and Rachkir are both pretty good players I found MLiquid on an OFC server late one night when he could barely move and I kept killing him all over the map.  So instead I started to show him stuff and I told him about the U.  He took it that info and ran with it and he got better, alot better.  Rachkir appeared in a our server one night and he too put up with the abuse being dished out on him so I invited him back and we started showing him stuff too.  He and MLiquid joined my clan and then trained together all the time and both got good fast.<br>
<br>
I still see new players come into my server.  Most of the time they leave after 2 or 3 deaths and we never see them again.  I have one or two right now that have come back and I have started to teach them some of the advanced stuff.  I have a clan member that started with us playing TF2 and he has now expressed interest in DM.  I took him to a private server and started teaching him grav nade and strafe jump.  <br>
<br>
They have to want to learn and yes they have to be able to put up with getting beat up.  You can show them every advanced technique there is, but they have to put the time in to learn it and then learn how to do it well in an actual game.  If they cant put up with that then its kind of a pointless endeavor.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You know those server messages that pop up on everyones screen when they start the map? Why not have easy to follow  instructions and links to anything they could possibly want to know about the game in front of them for those not able to press escape and put two and two together.

The part of the "Problem" I was refering to was the complete lack of desire to do anything. As you point out this entire group has lost all motivation and its just a hobby. If you want to go down with the ship then that is your perogative. I'm not going to sit back and do nothing and I've apprently been talking to a bunch of kids this entire time.

<br>
nothing you have posted in this thread is complex.  your original objective was, by your own admission, to get feedback on your idea.  i think you have gotten that.  let us know how your school is going.  almost all subjects can be related to a Seinfeld episode, this one reminds me of the one where Kramer tells Jerry he is getting rid of all his furniture so he can build levels.  Jerry bets him that he wont do it.  Then Kramer says the bets off cause he's not doing the levels, but says he could do them if he wanted to.  When all the while Jerry couldnt care less if Kramer actually did build the levels, and all Kramer was looking for was feedback and a reaction to his idea.  you see where im going with this, or is that too complex?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, I have been intending to update the site for a while.

A suggestion; stop. get away for a while and quti seeing the people you do now. avoid fastfoods and sodas. don't get into a relationship and get a job somewhere unimportant. after a few months things will start to clear.<br>

I've also come to the same conclusions. I'm glad that I wasnt the only one...take life in as it comes, learn the basic skills you need to survive and go out there and MATURE. Another thing to consider, why do you think all of the ancient civilizations sent there kids on "Vision Quest's" and to face life and death situations?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
nothing you have posted in this thread is complex.  your original objective was, by your own admission, to get feedback on your idea.  i think you have gotten that.  let us know how your school is going.  almost all subjects can be related to a Seinfeld episode, this one reminds me of the one where Kramer tells Jerry he is getting rid of all his furniture so he can build levels.  Jerry bets him that he wont do it.  Then Kramer says the bets off cause he's not doing the levels, but says he could do them if he wanted to.  When all the while Jerry couldnt care less if Kramer actually did build the levels, and all Kramer was looking for was feedback and a reaction to his idea.  you see where im going with this, or is that too complex?</div></blockquote>

I've learned everything I need to know about life from Seinfeld.</div></blockquote>

I never implied it was complex. I think, if you yourself could actualy comprehend what is in front of you, you might be on the same level.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

No. I've known InFeRnO since before joining the U. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure what I could add to this. It's always great playing you on socal, and the idea of a boot camp (like Opposing Force?) doesn't seem like a bad idea. I'm sure if the map turned out to be nice and you were VERY diplomatic about it, you might be able to convince WT to run it on the University Training Server or other servers with a similar interest. <br>
<br>
But at every moment you seem to be burning your bridges. If you'd stop with the ranting and the chronic defensiveness, you wouldn't have people thinking you're a troll. I think it usually isn't other member's lack of reading comprehension, but your own. You're interpretation of the most benign of posts seems to follow whatever mood you happen to be in. I'm trying to think about what might be the problem in seeing a message for what it is but all I can advise  as an annonymous friend on the Internet is to seriously cut back on the drugs, they aren't doing you any good. You read insults in posts that have no insults. Then you insult that person, that person insults you cause he can't leave it be, and you won't leave it be when he insults you back, so now you're in this viscious cycle that doesn't have a good ending.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

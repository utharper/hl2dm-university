	<div class="content">I think it'd be nice to have an active clan/team listing<br>
with every active team listed, for the recruitment section as a sticky.  I've seen these on other community sites and we would do well to list them,  either teams that compete in cal or just own there own pub and play there.  We could post on their forums and ask them to share some info about themselves here getting more of the community here on the U would be nice.  From every team.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yes, most of us were originally in CRUNCH and moved on because they were against any type of organized play and were a little wacko lol. Snail joined us a couple days after we started the CGC back in 06.

yup, I certainly do. Those were the times back then.  I remember Tarken playing in our server daily and bitching about his internet service all the time lol. Back then there wasnt any advanced movement being used so it usually went down to who knew the map and aimed better. I actually preferred the game back then. Players grav jumping all over the place and nobody knew any of the maps lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

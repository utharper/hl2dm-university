	<div class="content">I guess it could be done for 4v4 and 2v2,  just have a set of rules and be pretty open ended on recruiting,  This idea worked really well in dods when the community site sponsered a CAL team, and just picked up the free agents that had a problem finding a team or whatever reason didn't have enough to play with.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">We are a clan and team neutral organization, so there will not be a "HL2DMU" team as such. For the same reasons, I do not want there to be a dmu tag either.<br>
<br>
My recommendation is that any regulars here who want to play but don't have a team, sign there name down, and then come up with a cool team name and have at it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

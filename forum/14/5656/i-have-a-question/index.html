BTW, changing into a seagull doesn't enable you to fly around the map since it doesn't change your player animations and rig and you're still restricted by their "laws". <br>
other players in game will see you as a seagull flying low with weapons attached to it about 32 units high above ground.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

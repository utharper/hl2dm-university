Google translate and anything related to google - google itself even - may be tricky at times but can prove very helpful to those who know how to use it. I tried about 7 languages and combinations and I have to say it depends on the language. For some duos it's perfect, for others a complete disaster which can me minimized if you take my advice. I have to ask, are you gonna rephrase your post here n comments there, using ANY translation tool or translating person? As you can already see, no one can help you if you don't make urself understood.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

This is all false, not what I wanted to say. And to be short, I offered to make servers similar to that shit Howi offered, with no bhop, where new players can avoid hard pwning. But they would allow only temporary usage for players, so nobody starts playing this way only (because this would be able to decay the community with bhop haters). After blocking at the server, newbies would have seen the link to HL2DMU and go here involved into the game already.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

this website and its forum are dedicated specifically to enhance the game and help new comers. you are an advisor here. don't get all hurt when someone puts a mirror to your face.<br>
my post was directed at the general attitude as it were of the posts this guy got. i wasn't going at anyone in particular. but since you asked..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

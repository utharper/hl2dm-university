	<div class="content">Recently I have noticed that clans are coming and going, new faces appearing and old faces disappearing. Meaning that some people are new to this game and thinking about starting a clan. Perhaps there should be a section like the athletic centre were you can request help in starting a clan? Asking for help like, how to recruit or how to organize a clan fight properly? This may sound incredibly stupid to certain people but , I believe it is a good idea perhaps worth thought? I found myself about a year or so ago in a very embarrassing position were I did not know how to recruit or run a respectable clan with sensible requirements.<br>
Thanks for your time, and its a nice community you have set up here.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">idk if this is such a good idea for the forums, and to write an article on it wouldnt really.. be right.<br>
<br>
everyone runs their clan differently, some choose to be nazis with rules and others are easy going, everyones got their own idea of how a clan should be run.. you could pick a team you admire and model your clan after them, or just roll with the punches.<br>
<br>
an article explianing the basics of scrims wouldnt be bad tho.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I hate to say this but you've got a point. LOL yeah probably an article about scrims would probably be more concise.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I dont think he means it that way. A article with rules would be useless thats right. But an article about how to setup a forum, stats, servers etc everything someone needs who wanna build a clan, i think that would be very usefull. The recruiting office is allready there so maybe we could expand that section.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Setting up a forum really depends on where you are getting it from.   There are places you can get free forums online to start off.<br>
<br>
I think there is an article somewhere about servers, Ive never read it so I dont know what it says. <br>
<br>
Basically to have the best chance to build a clan, you need a server with good/fun maps, a way to fast download maps to clients, a forums, and a couple of friends to help you sit on the server and attract people to it.  Being friendly also helps.  I have heard alot about people going into servers where people were rude, generally its a turnoff.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have to say you have some decent points here. But alas I do not mean you should tell them how to run it , just a section were people can ask experienced clan hierarchy how they would deal with a certain situation , eg : clan fights , clan troubles , clan recruitment , server setup. As a clan leader of kc, I can understand how some clans might decide not to go about situations in a certain way, which would require at least several posts from people just to give the newer clan leader or clan member a idea of what some clans might decided to do. Department of Sociology sounds great, in the description it can explain what is meant? These are mere thoughts though, thanks for the feedback.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Hi all, I just ran across your site. I'm glad to find a group that's passionate about increasing visibility of good maps in the community. I was too, back in the day when I created this site:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://ascendancy.us.to" class="postlink">http://ascendancy.us.to</a><br>
<br>
The site hasn't been updated in two years (and don't expect any more updates, either <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">), but even if I had maintained it over those intervening years, I doubt the map collection would've doubled in size.<br>
<br>
Feel free to use anything you find on the site, including a list of all the map sites I could find in 2005-06, as well as the screenshots. All screenshots are 800x600, resized from 1600x1200, 8xAA, with the crosshair and HUD removed. Most of the download links are probably broken by now, but you'll probably be able to find active download links for all the maps on the site.<br>
<br>
It's unfortunate that most of the great maps don't get the play time they deserve. At one time I was running a map stats aggregator that pinged all servers every 7 minutes to see which maps they were running (I think I still have the C# code around if anyone's interested). If memory serves, the ranking of maps by number of player-minutes saw a couple of the official maps on top, followed very closely by several variants of dm_killbox and other gimmicky maps. I have a feeling that this is mostly because people--server operators and players--don't know what the good maps are.<br>
<br>
Cheers!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">See this is why I love this guy, PURE hilarity.  Just great, the hl2dm world hates him and his sense of humor endures. BRAVO chap.  But maybe you should stop looking for trouble eh?  Be your gloriously un-PC self, just don't go looking for places to be that person where its obviously not appreciated.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> Like my server for instance, your always welcome, I find your humor entertaining, therefore making it the perfect venue for your shenanagans.  Just don't be malious with your uncouthe jokes lol, some people of lesser mental constitution can acctually be offended by your off color toilet humor. :roll: So really what im trying to say is your a good guy, but everyone deserves respect, both you and your audiance.

Sorry for butting in where I have no personal experience Modus. I am completely ignorant as to what has gone on in your vent and am not trying to say anything about how you guys moderate it. My comment was less about New Guy and more about the racism, thats really what caught my eye in your post.  Racism imo is not appropriate in any social forum be it internet or RL.  There were obviously ways you could have conveyed your vehemence without resorting to racist remarks.  Its like people using the word "gay" all the time its just stupid.<br>
<br>
Sorry for perpetuating the bad vibes WT, but it had to be said.  I'd say lock this baby up, nothing good is coming out of it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

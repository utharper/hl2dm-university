	<div class="content">Your page says something about how the loser of the M64M/Micah match got to play against drago for the consolation prize of second place, which is wrong.  When there were 3 people left, it was micah left in the upper bracket and then me and drago left in the lower bracket.  Then drago and I played each other to see who would go on to the finals and who would be awarded third place.  I beat him first, then lost in the finals.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I was trying to make sense of it by looking at the results page on gotfrag.com and I thought I had it right. I guess I interpreted it wrong:<br>

<strong class="text-strong"><a href="http://www.gotfrag.com/portal/scores/brackets/591/" class="postlink">http://www.gotfrag.com/portal/scores/brackets/591/</a></strong><br>
<br>
Would you mind helping me finish the page? I was asking MODaL on xfire about it, but I don't see him very often because I am only on late and the time difference makes it tough.<br>
<br>
Not being able to figure out which demo was which caused me to delay exporting them and I would like to get back on track. Any info you can provide on which demo goes with which round would help me out immensely.<br>

	<div class="content">Took another look at gotfrag.com. I guess there use of the term "consolation" threw me off and I got it back to front. Makes more sense this way.<br>
<br>
So not only did you have to beat Oozy and MODaL to get out of the lower bracket, but you had to also go through Drag0's "second chance" to earn the final position, correct?<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also, the demo pack that was put together, do you think that is everything that can possibly be obtained, or is there the chance I could get in touch with the other players to see if I can fill in some of the gaps?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As for demos, I'm pretty sure anything that wasn't released is gone forever.  They had us playing on alienware computers that were temporarily "donated" for the tournament.  According to the admin that was there, as soon as the second day of the tournament was over the machines had to be "packed up and shipped back to the alienware warehouse" or something.  I think after the first day of the tournament he or somebody else went through the computers and extracted some of the demos, but after the second day they never got a chance to get them.<br>
<br>
Beating drago was really no different than beating anybody else out of the lower bracket.  It just caused me to continue on and him to drop out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Cool, thanks man. I most likely will have the same issues getting in touch with you as I do with others, so I will just PM you here if thats ok.<br>
<br>
I think the best thing to do will be just to convert each demo, then ask for your help to place them in the correct round. Shame about losing the rest, but what we have is better than nothing at least.<br>
<br>
Be in touch...<br>

I don't remember exactly... I do recall that at least for some of the matches there were 4 players in each server - the two people playing and then two bots in spectate mode.  I don't remember if they were sourceTV or some kind of special bots or what.  But they were displaying clips live from the finals on a big screen and I think it was being pulled from some kind of sourceTV system.<br>
<br>
I also don't remember specifically whether they had me record the final match but I know I would have recorded unless they specfically told me not to.<br>
<br>
Not like they ever went back the second day to get the demos off the hard drives before they sent them away, anyway...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

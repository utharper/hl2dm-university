<br>
I am sure there are many people like me who dont have and idea how to run/manage a server, add plugins like headshots, the rcon commands, etc.<br>
<br>
A course like this will proberly encourage people who want to get a server but not sure about how to run it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think most servers out there have the Bandwidth settigns wrong sure if you run it form your own PC then bandwidth is limited but when you rent you have unlimited you may as well set them as high as possible. <br>
I restart my server once per day.<br>

	<div class="content">A guide for running a server will take a long time to write and would be a lot of pages.<br>
The best way to learn is to get a server and learn.   Often, the server provider has a forums where people ask questions and get help on server setup.  <br>
If you need help ask someone you know well that has a server.  Most of the time they are willing to help.  I learned alot from doing web searches and asking people I know that had servers.  I also learned through trial and error.<br>
<br>
The main things with running a server are<br>
<br>
If you are running mods and plugins, make sure that you dont run mods that conflict.<br>
It is impossible to list all the mods and plugins and which ones might or might not conflict, its all trial and error.<br>
Best advice is to install one at a time and see how it goes before you install the next<br>
<br>
Maps:<br>
Make sure you dont load bad maps (ie maps that are corrupt or crash the server).<br>
Again its impossible to list them all, again this is trial and error.<br>
Load a few then run through them to test them.<br>
<br>
Configs are basically what you as the server owner wants.  There is no "good" or "bad" config, only preference.<br>
Possible options include things like sv_pure as well as gravity, map timelimits/fraglimits etc <br>
<br>
I would recommend restarting the server at least once a week and clearing out the logs once a month minumum.<br>
<br>
I would recommend having a fast DL redirect so that people dont have to wait 10 minutes for a map to download<br>
the file directory path of the fast DL has to match the file directory path where your maps are on the server so you need to make folder and subfolders to match so in the public directory of the fast DL you have a hl2mp folder which contains a maps folder, and whatever else needs to be downloaded to the clients.<br>
<br>
There is not a quick and dirty manual to learning about setting up and maintaining a server. Every game is different.   There really isnt much that can be applied across the board for every game server type out there. It takes a lot of time to get it down.  You just have to do it and learn.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

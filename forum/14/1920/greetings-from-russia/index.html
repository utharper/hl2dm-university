	<div class="content">Hi, guys!<br>
<br>
My name is Alex aka Dancer (perdoplyas). I'm the member of russian hldm 2 pro gamers community. Russian hldm 2 community is pretty big, we got a lot of top guys, whom you might probably know, btw, and loads of other players with different level of skill. So.. to the subject of this message. I and my friend have recently come up with an idea of creating a site similar to your University. That site will help russian players to learn the basics, improve etc. So the mission is the same. <br>
<br>
We thought about not just creating a similar site but creating an official part of yours.<br>
<br>
What I'd like to know:<br>
<br>
1. Is it possible to create our site in connection with yours? (banners, links exchange, using the same logo etc)<br>
2. Can we use your materials (tutorial etc.) to translate them into russian and post them on our site?<br>
<br>
It would be really great if you like the idea.<br>
Please, contact me as soon as you can.<br>
<br>
p.s. sorry for my english</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
We plan to add couple of other changes to your logo if we're allowed, but we want to keep the initials the same (we dont have a designer who could draw an independent logo, moreover this will show that our project is connected to yours.<br>
<br>
Doing so you will help us greatly!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think the best thing to do would be to create subdomains here at the U such as ru.hl2dm-university.com then give FTP access to the subfolder which the subdomain points to and drop all the current U files into it minus the forum, then the language translation team translates all the pages in less work and its up and running. Then you create a specific forum sub group for languages and add each language to it so the russians would have a forum to communicate in. This would be the most unified way of doing this. And once done the system could be applied to other languages. Then the hl2dmu header is altered to have flags that can be clicked on to take people to the translation sites.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
That being said, I still think a translated version of the main site (non-forum) as a sub group, would be an excellent idea. The problem is the forum (and wiki unless you translate that too) - how would you keep it clearly separate from HL2DMU? If a clear disclaimer and hosting the forum at a different address isn't enough, I don't know how to solve this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I still have the raw files of my movement tutorial. If you want me to do a russian version, please contact me through pm, and email me a .txt file with all the translations of everything written on my tutorial. Make sure it's flawless (regarding russian grammar and spelling).<br>
Otherwise, don't do anything <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What we have now is  materials from your site translated into russian. We've bought <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.ru" class="postlink">www.hl2dm-university.ru</a>. We're ready to start the project. Please, tell me if you agree or not. Tell me if you want any special terms (should we place a copyright mark etc.). We're planning to open it on 1st of september. <br>

<br>
Maybe you misunderstood my post:<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Walking Target wrote:</cite>Please do not use the HL2DMU logo or name to build your site.
</div></blockquote>

The domain is fine, but I am asking is that your site does not look the same or use the same graphics, like the green and black icon, or the DMU Coat of Arms. All of the content (text, videos, files etc.) you may use freely. You will just need to come up with some unique graphics for your site to replace the ones here.<br>
<br>
Good luck with your site! If there is anything here we can do to help you, just ask.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

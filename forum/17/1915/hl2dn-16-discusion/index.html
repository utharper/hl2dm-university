<br>
ya, and your team was the first one to start, team 1v8 and team 4v5 didn't get started until 10:15 or so.  That and, we started doing picks at 9:15pm that took way to long to get done.  Might need to go with 8pm, for just in-case something goes wrong.  Team 4 made finals and didn't finish until 12:50am.  Thats way to late.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

anyways i can' t make it to the next draft night but now that i understand this a little bit more i think i'll be able to make it in about 4 weeks from the 22nd. going on vacation for a while. so heres how i understand it, correct me if i am wrong....<br>
<br>
32 players, 8 teams, 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5. join vent an hour early, games start at what time?? 7pm i believe. <br>
<br>
umm also not sure how to make sure you're on the same team with your team mates in game. if anyone has any info/link for this please help with that. <br>

	<div class="content">I agree with Nino in making the teams as even as possible.  <br>
<br>
The time was too late.  I work for a living and can't always stay up til 1 am.  As it is it usually takes me an hour to get to sleep after leaving the computer (something with the effects of the screen and playing games on your brain).<br>
<br>
I will play dm_projects, bakbone, area 22, ld_r3, caverns, avalon amp, warlock, zeta, lv, lv_two and just about any other classic style map you want to name.  Backbone in particular would be fun to try.<br>
<br>
Will not do a 4v4 on OW (this has been discussed ad nausium...can you say dead horse?).  I also won't play on a kb map.  Snipe (kb) and smg spray (OW as 4v4) fests just don't appeal.<br>

I am not the only one who has discussed this, there have been many many posts and I am in the majority opinion here.  There are not enough weapons for 8 people with 1 mag, 1 xbow, 1 shotty, 3 smg nades, 1 ar2 and 2 orbs and a rocket.  Your gona spend half your time praying for a weapon to spawn.  And yea forget trying to get the mag, one of the few weaps that can counter the rpg.  All of the other maps you mention that are used for 4v4 have enough weapons for 8 people.  Its not the RPG thats the issue.  I didnt say its a bad map, in fact I love trying to kill the guy up on the roof with the RPG.  4v4 on OW would end up being an SMG spray fest which IMHO would SUCK ASS!  Its never going to get the votes for it as a 4v4.  Its a fine (and fun) as a 1v1 or a 2v2 but thats it.    It used to be a CAL map they took it out for a reason.  Ever wonder why?  Someone who has been around care to enlighten us?  <br>

I suspect there will be alot of trial and error in this tourney which is why I'm holding off my monetary donation until the next one.

Wouldn't it be much more of a challenge playing a totally unfamiliar map?<br>
It would still be fun and then it would be known at the end if it was a good map for competition or not.<br>
The other thing is if it turned out to be a bad map competitive wise, both teams would be at the same disadvantage during the competition.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

they would be 'new' to competition play. Yet old map itself.<br>
<br>
Caverns was used in one full season of cal.  So could be considered 'old'  I still think of it as a new and fresh map mainly because out of all of the full seasons i have played it was in about 10%.  If you started post Fios 20% and in s3 50% which would be most players now playing now. So it would feel old to them.<br>
<br>
I guess I will put dm_caverns_r1 *old* or new on the other maps in the vote and we can discuss if you feel that map is in fact whatever I put down.  If we feel a vote is needed we can vote on a certain map being new or old if need be.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I agree with ninoj on this.I for one never knew CAL cycled Caverns already for one full season, so by my definition I guess it is old... Caverns realistically is an older map but it's potential is still being exercised today strat wise, it'd be ridiculous to retire Caverns even if it is an "old" map. Also playing entirely new maps, I'm going along with it but I've played em all, you get what you wish for. I think most of the new maps are underdeveloped or too sloppy to provide serious play. After more and more scrims on Mileau I'm finding the camping and sloppiness of play revolving around the RPG area even more ridiculous and outlandish then Zeta/LV, but far less fun in it's ridiculousness.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I agree for the most part, but my vote for all new maps has nothing to do with maps made within the last year. It has to do with maps that have never been in any league lol. There are plenty of old maps that can be used that are just wasting away.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Well, I think it deserves more of a shot because maybe the scrims I've been in Mileau are flukes. For our scrims they turn out to be someone going for the RPG, but camps in the water until it's safe but then everyone eventually just jumps in the water over and over again and it usually takes forever to get the kill in the water with the pistol anyway.... Also if you do actually get it up the spot you camp it in the area is very tight and provides for very predictable and untacticle kills unlike zeta and even LV... All that aside I'm trying to say MIL still deserves a shot because it still has alot potential and others may play it differently then we did.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So now you start seeing the difficulties in being the admin who makes final decisions on maps. Rhideon and Fearsome forced new maps down our throats, in which some became popular, some didn't. I lol'd when I saw that people overwhelmingly voted for ALL NEW maps here and in the actual map voting thread it looks like there will be only one new map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

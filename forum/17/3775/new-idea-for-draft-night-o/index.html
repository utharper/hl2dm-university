well, ive been trying it out with neo some this weekend.  as someone completely new to pro... its a bit overwhelming.  while there's something to be said for choices... there may be too many choices.  if people dont stick with vanilla dm because its too compicated, why would they try pro?  i can see the potential for this mod, but manoman there's a steep learning curve... just to figure out how best to use your settings.  lol<br>
<br>
and then you have so few servers, mostly euro.  some with 1.9.3, some with 1.9.2, i think i even saw one with an older version than those.  kinda sucked to join a server only to realize you cant play cause you have a diff version.  <br>
<br>
i'll keep trying it out from time to time.  i do like the movement much better than vanilla dm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Pro when used in season 1 of cal, they updated it and changed some things to vanilla hl2dm, so they were forced to drop its use.   It was used in all of season 1 of STA with no problem, but then right before season 2 of sta Pro was completely broken by some stupid buggy game and wasn't used or even thought of using again in a NA league.<br>
<br>
At this point if pro is stable, it would be worth using for league play.  <br>
I think a different format for the draft is in order, and possible.<br>

Pro mod will only be as good as you guys want it to be and since hardly any of you makes suggestions or report bugs it's never going to fulfil it's potential.

I'm not arranging it but I'd hope that DJ Z3R0 is talking about playing it in Vanilla mode. <br>

<blockquote><div><cite>SND wrote:</cite>I do hope this villa mod feels like the current hl2dm if it does not well I'm afraid I will h8 it and spite on it and well you know.</div></blockquote>

It's smoother than HL2DM and you tend not to get stuck on/in every single prop.<br>
<br>
It might feel different if you've been playing normal HL2DM for X amount of years but you'll soon get used to it. Then when you play normal DM you'll notice how rough/buggy(ofc) it is. Give it a chance (more than 5 minutes)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Exactly I'm thinking of playing the drafts in Vanilla Mode. Maybe in the pre-post match have it in another mode, like the arena 1v1 mode so everyone can warm up but the draft matches would actually be played in Vanilla Mode. I prefer playing in Promod its a lot smoother than reg DM is. And it really doesn't take that much effort to set up. Maybe we could have just a quick night of people playing in pro outside of draft night to see how many people would be willing to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

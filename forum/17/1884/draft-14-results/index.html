<br>
the friendo thunda was taking forever to get in the server then when he tried to join he said he didn't have the map, so i had to get someone to replace him and since i only gots like 8 peeps on steam fwends, i asked invx who was the only one on steam i had who could play. after the 1st round pwn had to leave and we had to find another 3rd so invx got briggs to play 2nd round but when he joined he said he couldn't play cause his net was acting up and then billy left to go play cal 1v1, so we asked bunny who was in billy bo bobs team to be our 3rd for the rest of draft, then he said he had to go cause the apocalypse was coming his way, sooooo we asked briggs again and we waited to see who we where gonna play next, then briggs left so we got vals and waited in the server for about a hour or so but never got to play the next team soo i was like fuck it lets go play css.<br>
<br>
yap yap true story<br>
<br>
<br>
wouldn't say teams where all that stacked considering our pings but i am sure some would beg to differ. <br>
<br>
anyways gg's m8's<br>

	<div class="content">Khaos has been supporting a 10 slot public server for about a year.  I am beginning to think that it might not be as useful as it was when we first started it.  I really don't see anyone using it much for actual training, just really jump map enthusiasts when they have nothing better to do.<br>
<br>
Since the jump maps are really mostly not pub friendly and are available to download, I am wondering if its really useful for us to continue that server.<br>
<br>
The discussion regarding draft night has got me thinking that maybe a Vent server would be better and more useful for the community?<br>
<br>
I am willing to switch contribution to a Vent server if that is what the community thinks would be best.  I did a quick look and I think I can get one from my server hosting company at a reduced rate because I already have an account with them.  The prices look quite a bit cheaper than for someone that does not have an account.<br>
<br>
We would need some reliable people to run the draft preferably some willing to take turns doing it.  Of course I would give admin on the server to those willing to help out.  I personally don't want to run it.<br>
<br>
Please discuss.  I would especially like to hear from the DMU board and officers and people that are active in the community and in the game that would participate in draft night.<br>
<br>
The jump map server is up in February so now would be a good time to switch over if that's what you want to do.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">the jump map server is tard city most of the time.  needs a constant admin, i think, to be successful.  however, there is something to be said for helping others actually LEARN on a pub server... when the tards arent in control... vs loading up a jump map on your own listen server and getting no advice from others. <br>
<br>
i guess i vote for the vent.  but im afraid it will also die a slow death.  there would need to be a strong committment from MORE than one person to admin the draft nights.  and i would be willing to learn how to do that... AFTER this season of CAL is completed.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't very much care for it, and the horse certainly isn't getting anymore lively, i wonder if i could find a new horse, or at least put my money towards fucking a more recently dead horse? Maybe i should ask sisterfister about those Quake live invites, it'd be fun to play a game where the developer knows you exist... yeah, i'm totally going to play quake live from now on."<br>

Anyone need a quake live invite? If your on the fence still, please save your questions for someone good at multiple games like briggs or herb and not someone who religiously trys to save hl2dm between checking fish for penises.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Quake Live is just a lame rehash of Quake 4, but maybe you have been too stoned to remember Quake 4?<br>
<br>
Yes I have a JOB as a Fisheries Biologist.  Yes that requires that I sometimes check the fish for their gender because its important information for stock assessments and fisheries management.  Would you even know how to tell a male fish from a female?  BTW most fish dont have penises, but you probably dont remember that from kindergarden either.<br>
<br>
Also my JOB paid for my undergraduate loans and my graduate degree, and it just paid for my truck 6 months earlier than the loan was due, my DELL XPS 1730 Laptop that I got 4 months ago and helped to pay for a 38 foot boat that we had custom built in Maine, and is helping paying for our house.<br>

	<div class="content">Quake Live is far from a rehash of Quake 4, but since I'm really fucking high right now i better check:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.porse.cz/programy-img/quake_4.jpg" class="postlink">Quake 4</a><br>
<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/images/quakelive_15.jpg" class="postlink">Quake Live</a><br>
<br>
That has to be the worst rehash I have ever seen! I wouldn't expect you to understand how great the IDEA behind Quake Live is, since your knowledge of gaming probably doesn't surpass my knowledge of which fish species are equipped with cocks, I was busy learning how to spell "cat" and "dog" in kindergarten since how exactly fish fuck isn't very applicable knowledge at the age of 6-years-old.<br>
<br>
I'm 22, currently a student and live with my parents, i own very little but what i own i earned and have been working honest, hard working jobs since the age of 14 and i abso-fucking-lutely love getting high, like millions of other hard working, tax paying, god fearing Americans. I hope in 20 years from now on, when I'm your age, I'll be able to own the things i want, and then actually go out and appreciate them instead of returning home from work to battle over game politics on forums and IRC with people either half my age or leading just as sad of an existence.<br>
<br>
All of that shits provoked paradox, all the little fucking snide remarks about me and shit, it's not that i care, i really don't, it's that i did care enough to bite my tongue before.<br>
<br>
I don't like to play HL2DM anymore, fine if you do, and don't like Quake Live, but when I'm offering to invite people that i honestly enjoyed playing with and would like to continue playing with, keep your fucking cock holster shut if you don't want one "we all know you only care about one thing", shut the fuck up with that shit, i honestly care about so many things that "what pisses paradox off" isn't even on my list let alone a priority, imagine that.<br>

	<div class="content">As much as I love the jump maps I say bin it. If people want to learn how to bhop or strafe jump they can request a trainer (as no ones been doing that lately). As CD stated the U server attracts complete fucktards... most of which are Russian and as far as I'm concerned they can get their own server and abuse each other all day long , because they are and have been the biggest trouble makers on that server.<br>

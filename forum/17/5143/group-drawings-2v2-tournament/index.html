STANDYBY CLANS;;;   UGL-Markymark, Seven.  LsD- DS, Vitam1n.   Team =]<br>
<br>
<br>
These drawings were really done in random, as you can tell by how my team got stuck in the most ridic group. I will either begin on Thursday, or preferably Sunday, so you have Sunday-Sunday to complete them. Results of matches will be posted in the league events thread.<br>
<br>
RULES;;;<br>
<br>
One rule has changed since aliasing is becoming a potential problem from what I'm hearing, POV demos are now required. If you fail to produce a POV on request your team will take a loss, there is no two ways about it.<br>
<br>
Since the ghost spectate bug was proven to be a hoax, a bluff on zeiks part and actually doesnt work in HL2DM, source tv will be up for all matches. Rules are simple, schedule a reasonable time with your opponent and get the match done within a week. <br>
<br>
You may pick different maps for each of your matches. If there is a scheduling dispute or map dispute I will only intervene in the most extreme case, I want you guys to handle your own matches responsibly. <br>
<br>
As it stands we will not be allowing anyone to use their own server for matches under some evidence that our anticheats can be compromised or turned off during a match with someone who can claim their server is setup correctly. We will address eligible servers for the actual eFPS league later down the road.<br>
<br>
MAPS;;; Use reasonable maps, no killbox, no RP, no unknown maps. I am not barring say for instance Valars new maps, but I also will come in and bar a map if you pick a completely unknown map.<br>
<br>
<br>
GLHF<br>
<br>
P.S. Make sure the winning team tells holy what kind of sammich they desire upon the winning. Also I will mail along with the $1 dollar bill a hallmark card with a personal message of a derogatory nature.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Okay. <br>
<br>
<br>
BTW just a word before the matches begin, sometimes the anticheat doesnt ban right off the bat. It will ban in staggered times occassionally because there are checking intervals that sometimes speed up or slow down for efficiency, sometimes the anticheat won't detect variations until 2-5 mins in. In that case if anyone is claiming someone is banned please take a screenshot of the ban text so we know your claim is legit and be willing to do some server log analysis and confirm the ban was done.<br>
<br>
Note the anticheat is a beta version, if it should be causing proved crashes or noticeable lag I will reserve to right to take it down and implement zblock in the mean time while we optimize it again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

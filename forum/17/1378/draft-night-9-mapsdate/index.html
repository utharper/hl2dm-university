(I will talley up the map names and then post a vote on thrusday, so if a map you like has been posted before you remember to get your vote in by saying the map again, to let us know you want w/e map it is.)<br>
<br>
i wanna play normal draft time on 4/13/08<br>
<br>
If you want to play the draft on friday or saturday, someone needs to step-up with balls of steel and be an admin for the draft, cuz i don't commit to any games on those days.  (to all those people that say saturday would be a great day for the draft, i say, hold one on saturday then, I may or may not be around)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Question: It seems 6 times 4 equals 24. We had at least 24 or more. There were FOUR captains picked. 4 teams started Drafting and then left everyone else to play some kind of Pick up game that Paradox had to do all the work to put together. Why?<br>
<br>
I think it would be a good idea to have list of at least 10 permanent captains with servers (if possible) selected.<br>
The first 4 or 6 or 8 or even more would start the draft and you take the first largest number divisible by 4, IE, the first 16-20-24-28-32  who show on time and use the captains and then draft. <br>
Is there a way to time stamp folks entry into Vent and then give 10 minutes to draw in extra players to get to high 4 divisible number?<br>
<br>
Also, if U-participating clans supported Draft night with their match servers on Draft night, it wouldn't really matter who was captain and there would places to play, smoother running.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I asked the same question Impala and I agree with the answer.<br>
<br>
The reason is because with 2 and 4 teams, no team is left waiting around for half an hour.  With a 6th team (3rd pair) they would have to wait around for 30 minutes while the other 2 that won round 1 played then round 2 then one of those teams would have to wait around.  Thats what happened on the last draft night when there werent enough people.  It works better with 4 or 8 teams.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

just an ex. para i'll post my map selections later<br>
<br>
and in hind site i should have switched to 3v3 format(needing only 24 players).  Althou i don't really like this because you have so few picks teams will likely be uneven.....meh i guess not team 1 would get the 1st and last pick, and team 8 would get the 8th and 9th picks<br>
<br>
And as far as Para doing a mix match, i'm not sure how smooth that went, but she has shown in the past she can handle it better then most and get some games going.<br>
<br>
I just felt like people were getting ready to leave and are numbers topped at 28/29 then feel back to 24/25 <br>
<br>
And people just need to step up and be captains, maybe i shouldn't call it captain that implies you need to lead.  All you need is to know people in the community and their skill levels.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It went fine we got one match with 2 teams of 4.  I thought after that yea I could have dont 3v3 as well and had 4 teams.   I should have done that it would have gotten everyone to play so I am sorry about that to those that didnt.  I will know better next time.<br>
<br>
The only potential problem was the password thing, cause I had to bug you for them.<br>
<br>
Nino I dont mind helping out with the draft, but soon, Fridays and Saturdays are gona get harder for me when summer gets here.  Sundays are best for me too.<br>
<br>
Maybe we should call it server operator or RCON.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lets be honest, the teams that are eliminated first are the ones that are overall less experienced and skilled.  I would like to see what two more seasoned teams can do on that map.  So yeah Id like to spectate if possible.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If 6:45pm comes and we have 24-32 we will lock the Draft Channel.  All others will have to join the Draft Pool Channel.  For after the first 3 picks then we can bring in people.  <br>
<br>
SO IF WE START AND HAVE 24-32 <br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Non admins pm this to people like mad.</strong>  (This has happen to POMP several times there are 28-30 people in vent and we spend the 10 minutes to pick the 3.  And she just sits there doing nothing.  I say I am sorry to the 4-6 people left over from the picks and have to send them on there way. Then they find 2-4 players within seconds and ask to get in.  NOT TO SINGLE OUT POMP BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE.  DURING THIS TIME NON ADMINS PM PEOPLE TO JOIN THE DRAFT OVERFLOW POOL!!!)<br>
<br>

	<div class="content">Once the event starts  (6:45pm EST)<br>
<br>
1 - Draft channel will be locked. 6:45pm EST<br>
2 - ANYONE WITH A SERVER PUT IT IN THERE COMMENT (press the comment button and use the rcon command format " Connect IP; password password<br>
3 - Eight Captains will be picked (Admins will rank top 16 players in the Vent (quickly) and pick the second tier 8 to be captain  8-16)  Just based of opinion don't wait to long or care if it is perfect rankings <br>
4 - The captains will be put into "The Hat" program which will randomize the captains<br>
5 - Move the captains into the channels numbered 1-8<br>
6 - Picks will be made ( Other admins remind the Players in the Draft Channel of the rules and let them know it is going to start soon) <br>
7 - Captains  ONLY HAVE 20 SECONDS TO PICK.  After 20 seconds Admins will pick for them. ( an admin should be talking to the captains so they know there picks are about to happen )<br>
( After 20 seconds An  Admin should Pick the TOP Player off the board ( Admins should not hold off on the top player to stack the game))  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you leave Vent without pming an admin first you will go to the Overflow pool and get picked last If at All.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Will be needed<br>
<br>
So if you <br>
<br>
1 - do not get picked<br>
2 - cannot join until later (after start time)<br>
<br>
Idle the Overflow Channel <br>
(move to afk channel will be set to 5 minutes)<br>
(Pub will be in comment for games while you wait)<br>
<br>
How do you get to play in the draft from a Overflow Channel?<br>
1 - If we only have 24 players then get 8 in the Overflow channel  -  The last round of picks will be made.<br>
2 - Ringer, If someone drops (Again I need fair admins)  A player of close to equal skill will be picked by an admin for that team.    As in if Herb has to drop then Ko-tao can join from Overflow or If Cellar Drops then Para can join.   Don't think of exact skill,  think of what round they would be picked as Herb would be a 1-2 round as with Ko and Cellar and Para would be 2-3 rounders.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Again try to keep games fair so it is fun.  Winning by 50 is not as fun as losing by 2 points.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

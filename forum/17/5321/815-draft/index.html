	<div class="content">This past week was slow due to many ppl going afk during picks.   Who went afk?  Lego, I forget the rest.  If you remember please post their name I'd like to talk to them about that.   The set use back about 30 minutes, where otherwise we did pretty good.  About normal time for picks etc finishing it up at 8:30pm give or take.   We will have some more admins coming onboard to help so picks can be faster.  And please once the picks start and you need something ask Impala, or someone else.    If we have more admins,  I can focus on the picks and the other admins can focus on getting the picks to the team chats so you can easily contact your teammates.   The later time seemed to draw some players that other wise would not have made it.  But that leaves no room for error and means we need to bust right thru with no breaks and little chit chat.  Any ideas you guys have I'm all for them.  If you'd like to help just let me know.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Looking forward to next draft!<br>
<br>
I think everything went as smoothly as it could from the Captain/Admin side, the things that didn't go so smoothly and slowed things down are things that you can't control.<br>
<br>
The only thing I can see that could help would be to promote the draft some more, but that would have to be a community effort, and not just up to one or two people.<br>
<br>
I talked with a few people after the draft and they said it sounded like fun, but didn't participate because they didn't think they were good enough. I get the impression that's a prevalent feeling with other players. I know that you and others have tried to stress how this is for the whole community, not just the top players, but a lot of people don't seem to get that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yeah I have tried to stress that you don't have to be good to play in the draft.  It can be a great quick way to increase your skills.  Several of the guys getting picked in the first round were last round picks a year ago.  If we can get those new or unexperinced players to join and do 4v4.  The talent one round 1 picks are about the same and that goes for rounds 2 and round 3.<br>
<br>
I went through last week and spoke with everyone in the draft group.  If you enjoy the draft please talk to people about it, get them excited and it doesn't matter what the skill level is at all.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Maybe we can post a review in chat for any new players and up new Captains.<br>
There were a couple of folks that came in but pm'd me they were scared to death to play the folks in the lobby, lol, understandable to an extent. <br>
I am trying to get folks like EGC and other to come out.<br>
We need to set the map situation. That and servers is slowing us down but Servers, idk what you can do there.<br>
<br>
Zman left. WTF was that about?<br>
<br>
Also, confusion over having Captains right at pick time is no good.<br>
And my apologies to G. I did not notice the chat and his entrance as i was asking Redeyez. It was not malacious. At that point, was igoing to keep Redeyez or a guy that left the week before. Hope to see G Captain.<br>
<br>
-The only way we can really attract the newer players is keep working at getting 32 plus, which spreads things around some more.<br>
-There are Killbox and Stick Beaters that could be lured to play. Clan participation can help us attract some more players.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

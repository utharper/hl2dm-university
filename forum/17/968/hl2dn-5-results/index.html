Most unorganized Draft Night yet. No one knew what was going on the entire time. As to how long the matches were, how many rounds were to be played, hell, even which maps that were set. Nothing. And no one stayed, people left mid-matches to go do other things. Crashes every five minutes. Then people who weren't even in the Draft Night or Draft Night Overflow Channel were picked up to play on other teams. Just something I don't agree. Certain rules need to be set in place for the next Draft Night and those thereafter to prevent  the chaotic mess that we endured last night.<br>

theres nothing nino or i could've done to prevent crashing, and as for everything else (the lack of information) its in these forums.. read.<br>
<br>
there was some confusion on the maps to be played, thats ninos fault for throwing up a poll and at the end of the poll saying "lets play aftermath instead", i know no one wanted to play it, so i dont disagree with the teams that went ahead and played zeta instead.<br>
<br>
as for teams taking people up that werent in the overflow, it was empty, what can you do?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Ya sorry i wasn't on for enough last night to keep it running smoothly as we have in the past,  Bunch of new ppl this draft.  I think i need to make the draft player pool channel muted other then admins so i can get every Information on the night without the useless chatter. Which is why the first draft wasn't that great. But then ppl just kept quiet the next time around since it was mostly the same people playing.  We couldn't do aftermath as most server we had didn't have the map, as we used a few pubs instead of cal servers with no plug-ins which likely caused crashes.  As for people dropping, and others ppl getting picked up later that is something that is frowned on. As this upsets the balance in the teams.  Like we ended up with 31 players in the last round of picks so we needed one more and invx got on,  i didn't alow him to join and got Towel so that the last 8 players would be evenly matched in skill.  This is all for Fun and some rules need to be in place or you will not be playing in future drafts.  Please look over the rules.  And if a player joins late and he is a clanmate i might get a lil mad and ban you from the draft if you keep asking for him.  Any player joining after 6:45 will goto the Draft overflow channel.<br>
<br>
What We really need are a few more admins that I can trust to keep everything running smoothly  and fairly In case and issues come up.<br>
<br>
I went with the 8 players voting for what map to play and if their is a question of what map is to be played or the 8 players don't like the default map then by all means please call for a vote and play a different map.  The number one goal is to just have fun playing.  By having matches that get decided by 5 or less points shit we had one match goto overtime tied up at 197 a peice after two rounds. That had to be crazy fun. If people keep putting winning the draft and try to work around the rules we can just goto a full on mix-match round robin. Or some other format where the teams are not set and is much more formal and cannot be fooled with as easy.  So just remember the goal is to have fun, and have close matches with new players and vets at  a high level of play.<br>
<br>
Feel free to pm me with any questions or post in the rule section for anything you have an issue with,  this is a general statment of issues joule and others have rasied if you have any issues with certain players please also bring the up. <br>
<br>
Thanks for everyone who played and has i hope we can continue to have fun with the draft night.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

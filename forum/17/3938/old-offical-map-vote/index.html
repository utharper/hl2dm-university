	<div class="content">So here is the final map vote.  As with the nomination thread people outside of the tourney can vote. (some people should sign-up I am still looking for one more team or if kigha can figure out that kigha has a team signed up)<br>
<br>
Also Captains please pm me with your top 5 maps.  To show what the teams want and that your team is active.<br>
<br>
Pools will go up soon as the admins work to finish the minor details for the rules.<br>
<br>
top five maps would be <br>
dm_Caverns - 14<br>
dm_Milieu - 10<br>
dm_BioHazard_cal - 10<br>
dm_lostarena - 7<br>
dm_lockdown_r5 - 6<br>
<br>
If it ended today,  Not the new maps everyone was looking for but a solid group of maps I think. la and milieu would be new to comp, cav is not old. Shit r5 could kinda be considered new..... and bio is well bio.<br>
<br>
Anyway lets look forward to some fun games.  Matches will start within 1-2 weeks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yep, it seems its the same old thing where the vote means nothing. You should remove everything that isnt new.<br>
Although I do like LA and Cavs (and they are not that old) I have played them 1 million times and so they don't feel so new to me, I'd like to be forced to play something new. As far as LD r_5 don't even think about it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There are 50% old and suck maps. I really care, cos I wanna play and enjoy it.. <br>

	<div class="content">That was the point of both votes.  People want new maps, so I can do this vote and take the highest 'new' maps rather then just taking the top 5.  I was going to put on the end of each map weather it was a old or new map but don't have the time. and that may be up to debate.  Mainly caverns is the only one i have a question about.<br>

This vote will end mid-next (Wednesday) week and updated rules will be out with the pools so people can start getting the matches done.  So as of right now.<br>

mil, La, dm is alive, Jeager, warlock, rapidfire being the top 6 maps that have never been used in a full season of cal.  <br>

^ this.<br>
Not only are people who vote for old maps getting screwed, but there's no way to tell what you personally consider a new or old map. You said you didn't have the time, ok then wait until you DO have the time, rather than put up a vote which will completely confuse and annoy people who unknowingly have their votes thrown out. This is like the worst possible method of creating a vote... Include all maps and then later decide what you want to count as new maps, not only alienating those who voted for older maps or maps you decided were older, but allowing for significant bias. I'm pretty annoyed with how this has been played out.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

First, letting people that aren't even participating in the tourney vote eh I don't need to say more. Second, starting a vote without even knowing if that are the maps that are going to be in the tourney. Third, after most of the people have voted, starting to think about changing the maps or just picking the new maps out of all the maps that were voted for.<br>
<br>
Basically, I'll say it again. I think you should just cancel this whole vote poll and choose among the new maps with all the tourney admins, it's going to be way simpler and people won't go all out on each other because the vote wasn't made correctly and all that other stuff.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

FTW<br>
mudafuga<br>
remorse<br>
is_alive<br>
any of those I would be excited and be looking to sign up asap and I think that alot of people might just be the same way.<br>

I really am baffled though why you put up a vote asking the general population what they want to see and you get a overwhelming response of new maps only then you go and put a official map vote up with the same old bs maps like lockdown_r5 ( I really cant stop  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing">  at this map) just because a map has been revised (or screwed over) 5 times does not make it a new map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Way to go Zman.  Bitch and whine about the poll on the public forum just like everyone else, instead of talking to Nino in private messages (like any half-decent admin would do), and then hang up your adminship.  What a great way to help the progression of this Cup!  Bravo!<br>
<br>
I suggest something along the lines of what Confused said - Delete this poll thread and talk to the other Cup admins about the map selection.  Choose a list of only new maps for the Cup and then make a new poll.  Make the poll only open to people that are playing in the Cup. No need for everyone to get all worked up - we don't need anymore Zman clones in the community; injuring their household pets with furious little kicks.</div></blockquote>
You just flamed me for making suggestions and then bailing when they weren't followed through, and then suggested exactly what I did. Do you have some sort of mental handicap? And perhaps you're right that you don't need anymore zman clones in the community. But of course, we don't have even 1 zman clone in the community, so I Have no idea what you're babbling about.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

but seriously, what nino is trying to do is a GOOD thing and this BS thread is disrespectful to his efforts. if he makes mistakes that's because he is human. the fact still remains - he has enough balls to take this on himself when no one else steps up. so yall should set aside your well known and clearly overly posted differences and now go on and help up because in case you didn't get it yet : this thing has as much chance to work as we ALL give it. <br>
so...don't let nino be the fall guy for human mistakes and for YOUR OWN shortcomings. let him be what he tries to be - admin this league. <br>
you can do it lol. it's not very hard if you understand ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TEAMPLAY.<br>
now, as vals suggested already - let this be the first season which we can learn from and better the second season. move it the fuk along. it's all good. it's a game. games are fun. fun is a good thing and good things can be had <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Actually no, you're just an idiot. I tried for a long time both in the public forums and in the draft admin forums to get nino to address the issue and he hasn't so far.

Hmm, nope, I see nothing in his post that would lead me to believe that he skipped them. His post is spot on. I personally dont like the poll having alot of older maps in it either, but you went a little overboard. It's just a game, where winning gets you nothing but your own feeling of gratitude.

If it is not clear about something let me know.<br>

What happen with draft night 20 was we got to this point:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>If 6:45pm comes and we have 24-32 we will lock the Draft Channel. All others will have to join the Draft Pool Channel. For after the first 3 picks then we can bring in people.
</div></blockquote>

It was 6:45 and we had 28 players 4 short of our goal of 32 for a 4v4.  So the channel gets locked and players had to goto the pool channel.  They had 6 by time captains were picked and picks were about to start.  Herb and I joined the channel and told them to find two players to get into the draft and went on with the picks for <strong class="text-strong">3v3</strong>.   <br>
<br>
Soon after the picks started this channel fell apart with no leadership.  2 players left by the time the 3 players were picked for teams.   After the picks I joined the channel and told them they might become ringers if needed.   All of the players who had the patience to stay in the pool channel got to play as ringers.  <br>
<br>
<br>
All in all, we obviously need an admin to join this channel and provide leadership.  That channel only needed 2 players and a 4v4 could have started in 10 minutes 2 players aren't hard to find.  If you are gonna be late and you still wanna play join this channel cause you would likely get to play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

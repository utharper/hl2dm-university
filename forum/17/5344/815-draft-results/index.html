Slander/Fail admin alert. You realize this is the first draft I've been able to play with a teammate? You also realize nutri wasnt "aliasing" thats been his fucking name for almost 2 months now. Should I be your daddy and tell you everyones new steam names from now on so picks are fair? You also remember how hard I raped you last night? The most hilarious part of the night was when you tried to strip away Nutri as my pick, a sign of reasons why you'll never become a full eFPS admin. No one likes that dictator bullshit, nutri wasnt intentionally "aliasing" get over it.<br>

<br>
No i didn't, because it is DRAFT dummy. Playing with your teammate is something else.<br>
<br>
Nutri wasn't aliasing, as Tuxedo Chavez!?!?! That is your response!?! You are completely BOGUS.<br>
Only you knew it was Nutrigrain, otherwise he would have been picked before your 6 pick.<br>
You were just looking to rig the system.<br>
It ISN'T a League. We don't check out every player that comes in. It is informal.<br>
It depends on people having good sportsmanship and not trying to get over.<br>
<br>
Have some fucking honor why don't you. It's the luck of the draw. Tell me who knew who Tuxedo was, you shyster.<br>
And you're a godamned liar. I never tried to strip anything from anybody, prick!<br>
I said it was sneaky and moved on. I had no intention of stopping you or making you wait 30 fucking minutes to play the last match, like you did.<br>
I didn't pull any Dictator shit and i have never asked for or wanted to be a eFPS admin, you motherfucker.<br>
I got involved to help Nino and support the Draft, BITCH!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">No one tried to strip you of the pick.  I only gave the teams 1-5 the option of trading there pick for Nutri.  Since he should be a top 3 pick in most any draft.  The other captains said w/e so I dropped it.  <br>
I also had issues with Seagull and Lukegt when they tried to alias.  <br>
<br>
Although Val has a point any captain can look at the alias's to see it was nutri, unlike in vent it is pretty much impossible.  If you wanna win the draft you should be a captain with knowledge of the community.<br>
<br>
That said, looks like the finals was only an eight point match so I would consider this a non-issue.  While it might have been a slight of hand you did admit it immediately.  People most likely should have known,  I even talked to nutri and got him into the chat room before we got things rolling.<br>
<br>
GGs maybe I'll get to play next week.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
What was I supposed to do when nutri grain is still there after 6 rounds of picking? Just not pick him? Should Edge not have picked Bahlk even though that was clearly overstacking a team when he got a 1st round pick last week? No. You play and pick to win. <br>
<br>
I'm not interested in handing out reports to draft admins of everyone who changes their steam nick name every month or so, do it yourself. Take some responsibility instead of blaming others. Yes, also ninoj you originally did try to strip my pick in the first place, I have a copy/pasted text log on my desktop of that admin chat. Only after I started getting aggressive did you suggest down to a trade pick instead.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Just had to make sure you remember who brought this pissing war in the first place.<br>
<br>
Also your sinking into delusion. You actually think Nutri-Grain changed his name for a draft that would happen 2 months after he changed his name intentionally so he could be picked by me 2 months later in game he doesnt care about? He likes anime, its not some vast conspiracy so I could win draft, get over it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Val I didn't talk with pala at the time.  I saw what you said and took a step back,  Checked his alias' and it did not show any for some reason.  So then I checked a group he is in with me....the only place I know to find him since he changes his name all the time.  I didn't think that was fair to the other players, but Nih said he could see that it was Nutri so it at that point it was Dropped.<br>
<br>
I'd rather not lock this topic as some more SS's should be coming.  Blas for Val seems about even in skill give or take so I don't have a problem with that either.  I guess the match with Dal was the semi's?  If so the goal of the draft was achieved with matches under 10 points.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

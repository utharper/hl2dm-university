	<div class="content">Idea of this thread is to get ahead of the draft night by at least a month giving everyone time to get the map and test it out a couple times.  Asweel as server owners.<br>
<br>
<br>
What I like to see depends on the round the map is being played in<br>
<br>
Round One - since everyone plays i'd like to see a new map to be tested for comp getting a ya or nay after being played.  Goal would be for this round to be different almost every draft night<br>
<br>
Round Two -  A new map to comp but one that has lots of play time in pubs, or comp/scrims that may or may not be in the top leagues yet.<br>
<br>
Round Three -  Your favorite comp/scrim maps.  The default maps for most clans/teams think ld_r3/lv/amp/zeta or map that most think has really good gameplay and should be the next ld_r3<br>
<br>
Feel free to add any suggestion you want, if you like these ideas or not.  Post up maps that you'd like to see with the draft night and please get a ss of the said map so everyone knows what map you are talking about..</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Agreed, the first map should be the "freshest" of the lot, as long as it's reasonably able to be 4v4'ed. We should be breakin in the new maps as much as possible.<br>
<br>
Although I'm fine with the traditional choices.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

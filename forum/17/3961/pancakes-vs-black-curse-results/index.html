You sure about the extra commentary part of your post? It seems to me that letting people lulz over funny moments in the match or whatnot should be allowed, so long as the first post is clean and easy to read. Then again, if we have all the posts in a single stickied thread I can see that getting horrendously messy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The point Chem is so that people could look at the results of each match without having to sift through all the other shit that does nothing but waste time.  I am spending less and less time here these days because its summer and I do have other interests and better things to do with my life than read through lame bullshit flaming posts.  Thats fine, I will just have more unread threads to mark as read and move on.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I just thought it would be best to be able to view the results together in one thread for comparision rather than reading lots of other posts in between.   But as we can see thats a not going to happen so whatever.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

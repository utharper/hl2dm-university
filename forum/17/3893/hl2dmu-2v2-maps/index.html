	<div class="content">my 2 cents.<br>
<br>
<br>
warlock i'm not sure would make a great 2v2 but i might be wrong. just seems to me the layout isn't suitable.<br>
<br>
dm_ftw_r3 is perfect for 2v2 and i'm revising it in the next few days to control RPG better. currently the RPG situation makes it a camp fest.<br>
<br>
milieu is good for 2v2 and i'm glad people voted for it tho i'll be honest - it's clear to me most of them did so simply because it's been okayed by royalty. which is pathetic sorry to say. what would be the verdict if milieu wasn't in CAL one can only speculate.<br>
<br>
those who PM me and / or come to playtest my maps and repeat their WOW this is a sick competitive map then come here to vote on old maps are full of it.   if you don't think a map is good for comp play then why not say so and quti waste my time. If you DO think a map is good for comp play then why not vote it when the time comes? &lt;- rhetorical question.<br>
<br>
i think caverns and bio are perfect for 2v2.<br>
<br>
zeta is bad for 2v2 and LD, LV are just uuuugh get over it already.<br>
<br>
rapidfire is awesome map but i can see how it's too big for 2v2.<br>
<br>
the killbox idea is bad. will be nothing more than a spam fest. competition should be about tactics and strat. killboxes aren't.<br>
(yes, i was one of the people who pushed for a KB league and helped in creating it but time and experience showed my otherwise.)<br>

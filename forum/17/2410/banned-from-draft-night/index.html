	<div class="content">lol if someone has to get up for work/school and draft night is late getting started or matches take forever to get going, IMO it would be pretty harsh to punish and prevent people from participating in future drafts considering how hard it is sometimes to get people.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">idk, i think it was a couple peoples first draft and they didn't understand what was going on.  People need to speak up and say what is going on, once teams are picked/ being picked.<br>
<br>
Couple people i walked through getting vent, getting into the vent server, they got picked on a team, i pm'd them the join info, then they went to go pub...... <br>
<br>
I guess i am just gonna have to add this rule they have for the dods drafts...  And that is the admin of the draft can't play in the draft.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"> which is only me</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

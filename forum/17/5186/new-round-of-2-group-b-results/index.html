So did I when ewR picked it. Just when I thought team mexican fucked up terribly by picking overwatch against ewR, ewR goes and takes the cake for bad map pick. BTW this map is banned for the eFPS league for 2v2, they could pick it because I never explicitly banned it in the rules beforehand.<br>

	<div class="content">Let me say a few words.<br>
<br>
Blasphemy and Fantom lost to ewR on dm_organic_b5. Organic is a small map best suited to 1v1 play. In response to this perceived injustice, Blasphemy and Fantom attempted to force Cheese and Vaporizer tonight to play on dm_sonic_mario_land - a map with secret areas, random teleports, and a very loud Mario theme song blaring the background. I fully understood that this was a sort of protest against the fact that ewR was allowed to play on Organic. <br>
<br>
However, the differences between dm_organic_b5 and dm_sonic_mario_land are stark. Organic is a small map. But it is a league map. It is played competitively. It does not have secret areas, teleporters, or background music that makes hearing footsteps impossible. In short, Team Mexican attempted to force 911 to play on an unplayable map. I told them their map choice was unacceptable and requested them to choose a new one. After Fantom called me a bum looker about ten times, they chose dm_avalon_b1. <br>
<br>
This summer tournament was meant to be a test-run for eFPS Season 1 requiring each player to take POV demos. Some teams have followed this practice religiously. Some have not. Tonight, Vaporizer found out that Fantom did not record demos. He thereafter chose to dispute the match, probably because he was angry that Team Mexican attempted to make him play on Sonic Mario Land. The letter of the rules requires that Fantom and Blasphemy forfeit the match if they did not have demos. Fantom did have demos, however, and was simply attempting to create  more drama by lying to Vaporizer.<br>
<br>
Because he was angry that he thought he had to forfeit the match, Blasphemy demanded that pcek forfeit their match in which Confused said that he didn't record demo files. Confused says he forgot, and I believe him. But the rules require that his match for forfeited. <em class="text-italics">At least, in this case, neither pcek nor Team Mexican stood a chance of advancing to the championship since they had already lost a match. </em><br>
<br>
This tournament was designed to have looser rules to see how rigid eFPS rules would need to be. Three people tonight have convinced me that I cannot give teams the benefit of the doubt and expect them to play reasonably. Blasphemy and Fantom deliberately attempted to make 911 play on a map that everyone knew was unplayable because they were upset at ewR. Vaporizer attempted to force a forfeit win after he lost the match based upon the score. Fantom falsely claimed that he forgot to record a demo, and Blasphemy responded by forcing pcek to also forfeit their match. This type of behavior is mean-spirited. While it is in accord with the letter of the rules, it doesn't capture our intention when writing the rules that all teams would behave civilly and simply play to have fun competing. <br>
<br>
This tournament is almost over. But eFPS Season One is coming soon. The lessons we've learned from this tournament will be taken to heart and these problems will not recur.<br>
<br>
Let me finish by saying this. I understand that many people are upset about what happened tonight. But throughout all of this mess, both Valiums and I have attempted to be honest, compassionate, and understanding to everyone affected by this. We will edit the rules for eFPS Season One and these issues won't crop up again.<br>
<br>
Edit: I'd like to emphasize that both teams were at fault tonight. This isn't one team's fault or the other. It's the general interaction that they had and the mean-spirited results were a product of both team's poor attitudes.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

|911|'s behavior tonight was also not acceptable. Vapor stated he would not play unless it was a "normal" map (as he said like caverns, lockdown, lv) before blas even made his map pick. Vapor then asked for Fan's demo's without even requesting a demo review. He did it sheerly out of spite and vengeance to get a FFW. I was pretty disgusted with both clan's behavior tonight, and obviously yes, its a good thing we have rigid rules setup for actual eFPS.

The rates enforced are the ones you come in with. You are unable to switch between different rates once the match starts. It could be the server, or it could be the plugin causing hitreg lag.<br>

Games too small now... Just because I'm an admin doesnt mean I'm going to wakeup and stop talking shit tomorrow, the only difference is I do it in your face instead of doing it behind your back. Its all over and done, we came to agreement on the outcome and I think most of this page will be deleted by tomorrow. I'm the first to admit im confrontational here, I think anyone knows this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The efps server config enforces the cmdrate to 67-67, cl updaterate 67-67. Not the client. <br>

@holy <br>
<br>
Pretty much this is how it went down. I was testing out a bunch of maps, found one called dm_sonic_mario_land thought AWESOME NAME uploaded it to a server fanom, saw me playing it joined and we decided to make it our 2v2 map for the lulz.<br>
<br>
can we do dm_peaches_castle for our next game?<br>
<br>
on a serious note. you guys should upload dm_dgc_finca_v2 on the efps site it was one of the maps i was testing out and a really solid pub map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

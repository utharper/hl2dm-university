Sorry At this point I cannot plain to far ahead, I just have to see what i am doing on sunday and go from there.<br>
This past 2 weeks have been good, and i have posted the draft info on the Group 4-5 hours before the starting time.<br>
<br>
Shame Team 7 had to drop, but at least they let team 2 continue and let them know so they could take team 7's place even though team 2 lost.<br>
<br>
It was nice to have some players from Brazil and Australia play, both broke 30 with 300+ ping.  Was nice to get to game with them. Hopefully we can get more in the future.<br>
<br>
Trying to stay in line with cal for the maps.<br>
<br>
Post your ss's i will post mine tonight</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks, I wasn't very familiar with zeta, I've only played it like once before that. But it helped that I had a kick-ass team. I didn't get many screen shots mostly because I just wasn't really thinking about it xD<br>

And kudos to Poor Billy for the unbelievable amount of rape he dished out to all participating teams. He's gotten a helluva lot better than the last time I've seen him. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the crème de la crème clans doesn't take you up, actually.. I'm half-surprised that hasn't happened already.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I don't entirely disagree but it's always controversial to compare the old king to the new king. Kurtz was a one man wrecking ball who's talent from watching his demos is still unmatched only perhaps by Seagull. I think if mertz played with rhideon, kurtz and that one myserious canadian player who only played like twice a year but crushed everyone, cyn would make a win, except on caverns of course <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">. And yeah I can make this judgement because I was in the clan and saw their team dynamics worked to a perfection all the time somehow, which how they did is completely mysterious to me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

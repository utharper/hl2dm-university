	<div class="content">Ok new draft for the 2k10.  Shit most players that are playing now missed out on the earlier drafts or made one or two of them.  This will be a new system done on Steam alone.<br>
<br>
You must be part of the draft Steam group to be a part of the draft.   <br>
<br>
Timeline for the draft<br>
<br>
6:00pm - Draft event begins - everyone is to join the draft steam group chat page (That means you can see everything going on while in-game.  If you decide to not be captain you don't really need to pay attention until...more on that later)<br>
<br>
6:15pm - Waiting for players - 32 is the goal.  That would be 8 teams of 4.  Second goal is 24 for 3v3.  Depends on time.<br>
<br>
6:30pm -  The chat room will lock.  Captains will be picked.  (for the order I have used "The Hat" program that joule showed me.)   There will be an overflow chat room for players that want to sub in.  (Again join the chat and go about you business and you will be notified.  Every draft has used subsitutions.  Also if you drop a Third round pick, you will not get a 1st round pick to replace him)<br>
<br>
6:45pm - Picks should be going right along.  Once a captain is choosen for a team an admin will invite him/her to a Draft team steam group.  The server information will be posted there. (Draft team groups will be cleared after every draft) <br>
<br>
7:00pm - Teams should be finished picking and the games may start.  The server info will be posted to the Draft team steam group pages<br>
<br>
...finish later ( any suggestions on how to make this work better please feel free to post)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Might not be a bad idea, it will be easier to get to that number.  Depends on the interest that we get.  Just like that maps we would like to have at least on map that is the eFPS standard but keep things fresh with different maps as well</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here is a little more info on the Draft.<br>
There is more to follow.<br>
<br>
-The Draft will be 4 versus 4 (or 3 v 3, depending on participation) and will be run from Steam.<br>
There are 8 different Draft Team Group pages created for the teams.<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DMDraftTeam2" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DMDraftTeam2</a><br>
Team Captains will be picked (or coerced) and will be admin for their Team that night.<br>
<br>
-Heres' how it will work.<br>
All Draft members can check for any schedule changes and general information here.<br>
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/draftg" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/draftg</a><br>
Draft members will get periodic event updates.<br>
<br>
On Draft night, event messages will go out to join this group chat. Team Captains will be decided and while they are picking, each Team Captain (1 - <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="8)" title="Cool"> will assigned Admin for their own Draft Team group page, and get an invite for the Team Group. After selection, Team Captains will go to their Team group (Draft Team 5 for example) and they will invite their players and join chat there. On their page, the team will have server info to meet the other team.<br>
<br>
Everything will be done in Steam. The Teams will be the only folks invited to their group, so they can use their own chat.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
Join this Group prior to Draft.<br>
Team Capts will be picked and made Temp admin of their own Steam Team Group.<br>
They will pick and invite their mates.<br>
Join the server and kick ass.<br>
The rest of the rules to follow.<br>
--------------------------------<br>
We are looking for Team Captains.<br>
The Draft will most likely have a stable selection of 4 strong servers on a permanent basis.<br>
Right now, it looks like the old Sunday Evening is best.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Even in the small 8man draft we did the other day. Teams were set, server was set, but no one moved into the server nothing left to do but join.  I had some other things i was taking care of and no one joined until I came back and said yes join the server.  More people to just direct people will speed up everything.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

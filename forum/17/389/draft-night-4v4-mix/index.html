<br>
I'd like to try a different format to drum up support for it<br>
<br>
This Thrusday Night 9pm est I'll hold DM's first draft night. <br>
<br>
As this format is much looser then the NA cup would be this should be able to be a fun night of fragging for all.<br>
<br>
From 8-9 We will Get Any and all hl2dm players you can get into one vent server. At 9 the gates will close and the draft will begin.  With 32 players being the goal. Then 6 players with Rcon to a server put it in your comment and that will be put into a Channel to be captains, at random.  Then i'll go to each captain and have them pick from the 28 players in the draft pool. Once everyone is picked team 1 vs 8 // 2 vs 7 // 3 v 6 // 4 v 5 the winners will then go on to the semi-finals and then the finals.  <br>
<br>
After being away from the game for a while i was able to find 8 players within 10 minutes to do my own little 4v4 the other night on a saturday no less so i think this should do well. And could be a weekly thing if ppl really enjoy it.<br>
<br>
would be good practice for playoffs maps for all as well<br>

Get ready to spam this vent server to everyone on your x-fire // steam friends so we can get the goal of 32 players and get this draft rolling<br>
<br>
If you make it a bit late just hang in vent if anyone needs a ringer for someone that drops.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Don't have vent?  download it at <a href="http://www.ventrilo.com" class="postlink">http://www.ventrilo.com</a> <br>
<br>
create a name <br>
then enter the server ip then port <br>
hit connect thats it<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are aliasing please put your game handle in your comment so we know who you are!<br>
<br>
<br>
At about 8:45 I will pick captains.  I will ask everyone that has a hl2dm server with Rcon ready to go with the maps and cal.cfg to put their server info in their comment then randomly place then in their Team channel. <br>
<br>
At 9:05 est we will pw the player pool channel and only ppl in b4 the time cut off will be allowed back into this channel, Althou stick around if you missed the cut off in-case ppl drop/have to leave in later rounds etc.<br>
<br>
9:07 we will begin picks going from 1 to 8 then from 8 to 1  until each team is full <br>
<br>
9:15 teams 1-8 2-7 3-6 4-5 will be paired up and enter the high numbers server for Round one on dm_amplitude_r1 <br>
<br>
TBD winning teams will stay to be matched up against other winning teams to play ROund 2 on Dm_lostvillage <br>
<br>
TBD the final two teams will play the championship match on dm_lockdown_r3 <br>
<br>
Please do not use ringers of any kind as the draft will hopefully keep teams as even as possible, leaving for some very good close matches.  ANd maybe bring in some new clans to CAL.  And most important keep the fun factor as high as possible.  <br>
<br>
Look forward to seeing everyone on thrusday i will keep bumping talking taking questions.  <br>
<br>
If someone drops x-fire me and i will check to see if anyone is in the extra player pool section in the draft vent server, again plz don't use ringers lets have some fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">We had 32 players playing all at the same time <br>
<br>
we had more then that but ppl didn't really understand a few things and we need to add a few rules/guidelines.<br>
<br>
One thing to note is the 8 to 9 time period is for getting ppl into the ventrilo server and picking teams.  I saw a bunch of ppl leave during this time because they thought it would have started or thought it did start already and they missed out which they didn't. <br>
<br>
I think 2 of 3 is to long we will go with one round per tourney round winners play other winners loser play other loser ( can't have ppl wait from 8-9 then lose and then leave they want to play) so it will be a triple elimination. So we will play for every place 1-8.<br>
<br>
Don't alias, nuff said <br>
<br>
In 5v5s for cs.s you can't have ppl from the same team on, of course you will want them on your team, but the point is to play with different ppl. we had a few with 2 from the same team which i didn't think was a problem at the time because this is ok in dods althou you have 6 players not 4 so lets go with this aswell.<br>
<br>
I know i had some other thoughts but it's early plz use this post to post your thought concerns about draft night TWO!<br>
<br>
<br>

other then that we need more slots on the vent, vent needs to be config'd so its less annoying, and i think every week 1 map should be dropped for a new map.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

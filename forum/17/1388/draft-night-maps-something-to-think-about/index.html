	<div class="content">I love the map Amplitude, but I dont think it should be played as a first round draft map and here is why.<br>
<br>
Its very complicated and unless you have spend time studying it for CAL you are basically lost.<br>
<br>
This past draft night, I was with 2 people new to the draft and the other person had played the draft, but hasnt done many if any matches on it.<br>
<br>
So I realized that I was the probably most experienced person on my team as far as matches on that map was concerned  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> <br>
<br>
I tried to quickly explain what I could real quick and the few areas that are really easy to learn, but the fact that 2 of them were new to the draft altogether, I ended up feeling like I was playing in a pub against a team that knew a lot better what the hell they were doing.  It was a bit frustrating.  <br>
<br>
Its just too complicated a map to try and get a new person into what its like to really do a match.  We couldnt communicate.  If that is the goal here, its not a good map to start off with.<br>
I would suggest that it be used as a final map in the future and for the first map, something like Lockdown, Zeta, LV, avalon be used as they are much less complicated maps, everyone knows them and/or can learn quickly where things are.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

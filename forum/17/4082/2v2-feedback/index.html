<br>
I'd like to keep it going if everyone still wants to play, so think of new maps, find a new partner, think of a crazy new team name.   <br>
<br>
I am thinking of including euro's in the next one, having 2 divisions and they would not meet until the bracketed section of the tourney.  Also for EU v NA matches I was thinking doing a best of 7 like Baseball/Basketball/Hockey playoffs might be fun/different.  Just a thought to get the juices flowing.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

this, also I had a lot of fun with the tourney thus far, but I think a best of 7 would be a bad idea purely because of how long it would take.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I kinda like the format of 3 new/fresh maps for group play and then 2 older/known maps for the bracket play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yep, definitely had fun, but the thing about the best of 7 is crazy even if it's only for finals, I would definitely not want to play a 2 hour match, I find that 40 minutes can be long in some maps already, 2 hours, yea right lol. For the eu vs na match, imo I think it's stupid, I always thought those things were stupid because of ping difference even if you do 1 round each server it's just really horrible, the only way I play euro's now is in LAN's and that's only in css cause of course there aren't any LAN's in hl2dm lol.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Best of 7 could get dragged out along ass time if the teams are well matched and could take several days to play.   Maybe best of 5 would be a bit more reasonable?<br>
<br>
I would also think you would have a rule that states you have to do two rounds minimum at each sitting.  Also there is the issue of who gts combine on the last round if it goes to 5/7?   Do you give rebs to the team with the greater total kills as a "home field advantage" sort of thing?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well i was thinking of baseball/basketball format<br>
<br>
Game 1 - Home<br>
Game 2 - Home<br>
Game 3 - Away<br>
Game 4 - Away<br>
Game 5 - Home<br>
Game 6 - Away<br>
Game 7 - Home<br>
<br>
baseball the earlier games are best of 5,  But there is a lot of big IF's before we get to that point.<br>
<br>
Lets not get side tracked on this point until some of those things happen, like euro's caring about our little cup.<br>
<br>
Post the Pros and cons to what we just went through.  As I look to get some rule changes, and sign-ups for the 2nd Cup going next week sometime.<br>
<br>
Anyone that wants to help feel free to let me know via pm or post.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also we have the 2v2 cup group if you can help spread the word now maybe we can get some stv info going.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Although it would require a good panel of admins to organize and supervise the fun.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

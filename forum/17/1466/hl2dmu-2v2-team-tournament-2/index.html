you're doing a great job organizing these team games and draft nights!  .. the chances of setting a team game is a lot greater then any other way at the moment .. and that in it self shows it's success.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I have only made 8:15 an event,  i might want to do this on the draft group, but for now i will do it on the hl2dm:U group as it has close to 500 members now.  I will be a bit late for 8:15..could use an admin for that time aswell. I'd like to expand these games into later pst times, and even earlier with some EU play and times, Maybe even aus.  If anyone is interested in helping out with the admin of the 2v2 games please pm me.  I will make an event for the starting times, as of now we start at 8:15pm time with me, if you see an event at 6:15 that means i've found a admin for the time.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im in Wayne. Been here and out to West Orange, Lodi, Closter, and West Paterson. You got a lot a freakin Uturns here! I got lost coming up and asked a Gas guy (i CAN pump gas you know!). He said "You goin ta Wayne"? "Are you sure you goin ta Wayne"? "Why would you be goin to Wayne"? "Noone goes ta Wayne"!<br>

as for your gas, we don't trust you to pump it yourself, and there is the 'unionss' here that have protection from certain behind-closed-doors-powers if you follow my drift. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> <br>

	<div class="content">Well that didn't go so well, but we are spreading the word,  I really need people to pm me if that want to play, not just mention it in chat.   With a pm i get some kind of notice.  But anyway i think it's going well, took a few fails before we go a bunch of wins out of the draft.  So lets give it a go next week,  I think having less times to play would help,  I can do a round at 4:15/9:15/11:15<br>

that should work better.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

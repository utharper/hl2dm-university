Also note I added the home and away team.  Each pool should follow this format.  I did them randomly.  Oddly enough the top seed does not get a home match in pool play.  Away team has model choice first round.  The higher seed for the playoffs will get Home, which will be based on points from the pool play.</div>

No we will use the most up to date version of the map.<br>
<br>
Could someone find the links?<br>
<br>
<br>
So, teams you have until June 4th to finish all three of your pool play matches.<br>
<br>
Match comms are open forums, just send the password of the server through a pm.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think monarch is confused because it's not correct if you compare it to the actual pool schedule. Round 2 and round 3 should be switched. For example, Team 1 plays team 3 in r2 and team 4 plays team 2 in r2 according to the actual pool. The away/home graph has those teams playing each other in r3 instead.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

valid point. but i think the reason we are all hasitant to sign up is because we know what's gonna happen anyway.  our votes wont pass because the majority of players that have signed up or will sign up will only play if they have a chance of winning and because of that they will only play on maps they know.

<br>
lawl you guys....Ninoj ended up picking a bunch of maps that are pretty much new in the end with the exception of Bio. Look at our first match against SynGold, Blas never played Warlock in a single scrim and didn't really know spawns/weapons entirely which was the reason he did so bad on it, while SynGold had been practicing for at least a week on it. So far there's been relatively a small amount of bitching, and my bitching was about letting players have a say on pool ties, not some BS KDR/highest frag computerized statistic determine tie breaks. Other then that matches are being played quietly, and it's been pretty smooth so far. New maps and new players have been showing up old powerhouses so far in this tourney and if we beat 911 there's a shot SynGold could go all the way and surprise everyone. There won't be any delays either, teams have until June 4th to finish matches, end of story too bad so sad if they don't.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
That's why we never get anywhere in this freakin game/community. Because people are so scared that some teams won't play because of a certain rule or map well we do what they want instead of just having fun with the other teams that just want to play the game and have fun, you guys are always falling in their trap every single time. Just put new maps, people who want to play and have fun will play, the others will go wherever they want and after a while maybe they will drop their little self centered mind and just play.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Damn all I said was that blas didn't know the map. IF you want to get specific with it you played 2 scrims on that map, blas played zero. Maybe I should forfeit to 911 if your gonna come out of left field and be gay about it, I never even attacked you guys in the first place.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If you go to pick someone,  key them up so YOU can get them into the server or chat.  Don't expect the admins to do everything for you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">The Draft needs Captains 10 minutes before, solid. I spend my time and hang around on weekend asking folks to Capt in Steam. One doesn't show (Keptin). At least one disappears before we pick. One said they would Captain then backed out.<br>
<br>
Once i fixed the order, folks were bitchin about that. Some who have been there couldn't remember who played who.<br>
The Servers didn't DL the map and some folks didn't have b9.<br>
Folks were whining about how screwed up the process is.<br>
<br>
And it's all explained on the damned page.<br>
Its very simple.<br>
Maybe you need to just use Admin for PMs, lock the Draft chat and do it all there.<br>
Folks are spamming me asking me why i kicked them from the Lobby!?!?!  WTF. It's right there on the page.<br>
There is too much nonsense and grabassing and spamming me with dumb questions.<br>
<br>
If folks want to play, maybe they could stfu or be helpful.<br>
I just don't know.<br>
I don't think i have any patience for this and resign as a Draft admin.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was captain for his team. He was offline when matches started. I stalled for 10 - 15 minutes to see if he was coming back from a quick restart or something, but not so. I had also manually invited him to team chat but he never went in. I'm not sure how I could have done more in that regard.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
He was playing l4d1, key these people up and spam them with the voice chat feature.<br>
<br>
As for Impala,  that is what I get every week.  I think it gets worse when the draft is every week.  Every Other week may be better.  My hl2dm is all screwed up anyway, se we will take a break from the draft for the time being.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

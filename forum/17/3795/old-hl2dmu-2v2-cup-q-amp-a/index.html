I think rapidfire might be a good possibility, because a lot of people like that map.<br>

I would like to see a map that isnt a current CAL map or derived from a current map (ie no lost village clones) up there.<br>

Another map that came to mind was dm_feudal, but Im not sure.<br>

Also Chemical, what I was referring to was mainly the rule set would be similar to CAL.  We are trying to get this up and running ASAP.  If we have to sit around and reinvent the thing from the beginning, we could be here another month or two with no competative tourny/league.

As for the other maps in the rotation I'd strongly advise that you at least leave in one or two older maps, of course one of the maps I refer to is LD even though I like Lostvillage better...I can't reccomend Zeta because those who have been playing that map for years will just flat out beat a new team, even if the new team is more talented, zeta has a very steep learning curve IMO with tons upon tons of nuances one needs to learn to gain back RPG from a good team. Amp is chaotic but actually fairly balanced because the RPG is very hard to control.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Every single one of these maps are new, but are completely shotgun whore friendly, but I guess that's whats hip with being a modern, newer player, shotgun whoring that is even more effective then spam whoring... Lostarena is "newer" but is the most repetitive un-strategic maps I've come to play, the map was novel for all of 1 month in high skill player scrims. Please consider replacing LA.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I think we should wait until the last three maps of the contest are released. With a winner decided of course. <br>
I know dm_airfusion would be great for a 2v2 - and the others I have yet to see but are probably worth considering.<br>
<br>
dm_rapidfire is a bit big for a 2v2, and you will barely have enough weapons unless its one of the revisions abnoksius made.<br>
And the original had some problems with props and the speed tunnels - fixed in _r2. <br>
But there are two problem areas in that map with FPS that still exist. <br>
    1. Standing on the smg nade's spawn and looking into the middle of the map made luke's comp overheat. <br>
    2. At the entrance near the tubes/speed tunnels - standing or rocket ammo and looking into middle of map causes a big drop as well.<br>
<br>
Abnoksius has not had time for rapidfire with the contest going on, and currently airfusion is more demanding on FPS than even rapidfire, and he will be trying to fix that as best he can for the judges. So I am told.<br>
<br>
Also, LA really doesn't have the weapons and shit for a 2v2, and gets crowded real easy - but rapidfire is on the other end of that spectrum.<br>
And I wouldn't really consider milieu a ewR map - grain and pb rape at it sure, but didn't fearsome help valar out a lot with that map? <br>
I mean it was put into the CAL (when it was still around) rotation real fast. It's more bipartisan than you think Val.<br>
<br>
But LA should be replaced with a more non-ewR map. <br>
Ya know, lots of props to clutter shit up - not a lot of places to move, so a person with a limited mag can still hit, spam clumped together so anyone can gather it without knowing HOW to move and use it a lot. Yeah. Maybe.<br>
<br>
My biggest idea is that you wait, wait for some more possibly good maps to be released to the community.<br>

I know dm_airfusion would be great for a 2v2 - and the others I have yet to see but are probably worth considering.<br>
<br>
dm_rapidfire is a bit big for a 2v2, and you will barely have enough weapons unless its one of the revisions abnoksius made.<br>
And the original had some problems with props and the speed tunnels - fixed in _r2. <br>
But there are two problem areas in that map with FPS that still exist. <br>
    1. Standing on the smg nade's spawn and looking into the middle of the map made luke's comp overheat. <br>
    2. At the entrance near the tubes/speed tunnels - standing or rocket ammo and looking into middle of map causes a big drop as well.<br>
<br>
Abnoksius has not had time for rapidfire with the contest going on, and currently airfusion is more demanding on FPS than even rapidfire, and he will be trying to fix that as best he can for the judges. So I am told.<br>
<br>
Also, LA really doesn't have the weapons and shit for a 2v2, and gets crowded real easy - but rapidfire is on the other end of that spectrum.<br>
And I wouldn't really consider milieu a ewR map - grain and pb rape at it sure, but didn't fearsome help valar out a lot with that map? <br>
I mean it was put into the CAL (when it was still around) rotation real fast. It's more bipartisan than you think Val.<br>
<br>
But LA should be replaced with a more non-ewR map. <br>
Ya know, lots of props to clutter shit up - not a lot of places to move, so a person with a limited mag can still hit, spam clumped together so anyone can gather it without knowing HOW to move and use it a lot. Yeah. Maybe.<br>
<br>
My biggest idea is that you wait, wait for some more possibly good maps to be released to the community.<br>

<br>
Mileau- Good map<br>
Caverns- Great map<br>
Rapidfire- Enormous for 2v2, but a map that has serious potential for 3v3 and 4v4, could become a classic for 4v4<br>
LA- Controversial map with tight spawn points, repetitive, requires no stragedy except to literally walk around with a shotgun and kill people as they spawn and take all the weapons ensuring even if you miss their spawn point they'll still be gimped.<br>
LD- Still the most played map in scrims, even with caverns for that honor, people still WANT to play this map!<br>
Zeta- Match is usually decided in the first 3 minutes if the team has the skill to consistently hold RPG<br>
Lostvillage- Fun, fast cluster**** that produces the highest scoring rounds then any other map.<br>
Amp- This map is more even then others but makes you more angry then possibly any other map<br>
<br>
Theres my input, as Ninoj said we'll get a chance to vote so ya OH and I'll be signing up my team soon dont worry, just waiting on a certain someone to provide a contact and a final clan name</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

These two are pretty much a lock, yes? <br>
And right now we are looking to find two more maps, correct? <br>
<br>
If you go with a vote, admins, try to make as narrow as possible so that people know what they are voting for.<br>
Quite frankly you need to make one "old-school" map a lock as well, to make this shit fair and more appealing to more players. Just one though, I do despise most of the old maps but this is the first hl2dm:U competitive event so - I would think its best not to step on any toes. Some people are gonna feel that way regardless, but its good to at least make an attempt.  <br>
<br>
I would suggest dm_lostvillage_v3 - same layout as the original, but no bad fps spots. <br>
I am pretty sure we can accept that the lostvillage mapper is not coming back, and I don't know of the shit that went on between $W and Arm, but yall can move past that too - right? <br>
<br>
I would suggest that if any vote is done - it is for the final map to be selected for this tourney.<br>

Agreed entirely, anything related to the U should be to promote and reward people's efforts to make this game better. If 21 people invested their time to try and give this game more playable maps (and countless others before them), then I think we should definitely recognize that and give their maps a chance.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

valid point. but i think the reason we are all hasitant to sign up is because we know what's gonna happen anyway.  our votes wont pass because the majority of players that have signed up or will sign up will only play if they have a chance of winning and because of that they will only play on maps they know.  LD-caverns-LV etc.  so nino, by no fault of his own, will have to set it up with those maps because he knows the teams that already signed up will drop out b4 it starts or after playing one round on a map they dont know.  even if he does run the "CAL" maps it will never finish because it will be delayed due to the same bullshit that goes on in CAL and it will just turn into a name calling, finger pointing thread/post war on here.  the teams that arent involved in that war will drop out because they are sick of dealing with it, so one or more teams will get a bye which in turn will cause more controversy because one team will have to play a match while another gets a free advancement.  even if it does some how get to the final match it will prolly be an $w team playing a team affiliated with ewr........and we all know where that goes.......nah, i think ill just sit back with my popcorn and wait for the drama.  glhf tho.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Sheesh Chem... First of all nominate maps in the 2v2 Cup map nomination section that ninoj made. Second, we have ninoj as an admin, he's far more open to listening to complaints and restructuring league formats then any other head admins I know of. Third most of the 2v2 teams playing are mature enough to make this go smooth (most). Fourth, me and Blas, as well as people in 911 have been beating ewR and $W pretty reguarly, so far all the teams posted there so far are basically a four horse race to win, make it into a six horse race when 911 and synergy sign up their Alpha 2v2 teams. If this was 4v4 yeah, it'd be $W vs ewR but it's not a 4v4 cup.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Rules are as follows:  <br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Screenshots</strong><br>
The captain or designee of each team must take screenshots of 1) the initial console before each round played regardless of whether two servers are used or if the entire match is played on one server, to display the server’s sv_pure mode; and 2) the scoreboard and console status displaying the names and Steam IDs of all the participating players in the server.<br>
All players must also take screenshots of the opposing players before each round starts and of each round’s final scoreboard. This can NOT be a screenshot of the scoreboard before the match has ended. In the event of a dispute, if the disputed party fails to provide screenshots, automatic forfeiture will result.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Sportsmanship</strong><br>
<br>
Just dont be an asshat.  No spraying.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Disputes</strong><br>
<br>
Is this section necessary?  Is this going to be a problem?</div></blockquote>

I loved how sportmanship deserved 1/300 of the attention gave to the "Screenshots" section.<br>
<br>
Disputes section will officially be necessary if you leave the "sportmanship" section, wich is basically the only aspect that could really go wrong during this tourney, so vague and incomplete.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

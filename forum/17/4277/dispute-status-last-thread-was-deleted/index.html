	<div class="content">Alright, I never saw the first thread and I dont know who deleted it, but I do believe an answer should be given so I will give it.<br>
<br>
As one of the tourney admins, I looked at the one demo we got from Grain.  First of all I saw no evidence of an aimbot (which I believe was mentioned in the original dispute) and many shots where he missed wildly.   Out of about 40 instances, there were 2 that MIGHT have been evidence of something funny, but honestly there were audio cues for both of those that probably told him where the player was.  I believe you will find that Cellar Dweller reached the same conclusion.<br>
<br>
We tried to get a past ACS admin for DOD (I think) to look at them but I dont think he really wanted to be bothered.<br>
<br>
Zman, Confused, whomever.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry if my opinion isnt what you want to hear or what you agree with, but I just dont see blatent evidence of wall hacking in Grain's own demo.   I did watch the SCTV demos but I did not scrutinize them as I did Grain's personal demo because I have been told in the past that they are not as accurate as a personal demo.   As much as I dislike EWR and their antics at times, I can not and will not say there is evidence for hacking when I see none.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">here's my posts relevant to the matter:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>its just not there. thats my take from watching the stv. i'll give some particulars... but im not gonna waste my time beyond that. its all explainable from visual and audible cues... even w/o hearing match comms which could have made the situation more obvious.<br>
<br>
starting @ 11000, grain tosses a nade from sewers/front mag towards confused whose behind charger/crossbow room. nade doesnt kill confused. grain continues around front charger and lobs barrel (11344) at top charger. clearly thinking confused is still in that area. grain continues down hall towards back mag, takes 2 obvious mag shots to kill zman. at 11512, audible nade from right, grain turns right 180 degrees back towards front charger area while moving backwards (thinking confused may drop down behind him from top charger with nade). pb takes shotty blast from from back mag towards confused in the behind charger area (clearly comms could have confirmed to grain confused was still up there, but the shotty blast was enough of a cue). as grain continues backwards facing behind charger, he takes a mag shot which does not kill confused.<br>
<br>
starting @ 20281, there is an audible battle between pb and zman. grain is at ramp/redroom sweeping and looking when confused becomes vissible in front charger area (right of screen). at 20388, pb is killed by zman with smg nade which is easily heard (and easily commed location). as grain turns from redroom to ramp, zman becomes visible in far right screen leaving control via bridge. grain snap shoots crossbow for kill.<br>
<br>
starting at 28000, audible that someone is charging. grain moves towards back shotty and kills zman (obviously not the one charging). grain continues towards back mag. sweeps view left down hall towards font charger, sweeps further left back towards back shotty, audible nade from right... and grain sweeps view back to the right as confused becomes visible with a cooked nade. nice snap shot with crossbow for a kill.<br>
<br>
then at tick 30000, grain gets killed? wtf is there to contend? so i stopped taking notes and watched the 48500-49000. again, its all rather easily explainable to visible and audible cues.
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>just went through grains demo. plenty of ineffective spam along with explainable kills. the only thing changed in my opinion is a stronger belief no aimbot was used. difficult to judge from the stv, but grains demo makes it easier. plenty of missed shots.
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>i didnt review the demo's with r_drawothermodels on. to me, if its explainable just watching in default mode, why use r_drawothermodels. <br>
<br>
i would suggest watching w/o r_drawothermodels the first time. i may try r_drawothermodels tonight and review it again but i dont think it will change my opinion tbh.<br>
<br>
edit...<br>
<br>
while reviewing the tics confused supplied, i took notes using 3 categories:<br>
<br>
audible cues<br>
visual cues<br>
unknown<br>
<br>
i didnt see any unknown cues. but thats just my opinion. 
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>wow, that r_drawothermodels 2 is pretty cool. but to me, it makes all the players look suspicious throughout the match. it seems like using a wiretap to look for probable cause, when all you have is a gut suspicion.<br>
<br>
tic 13300... w/o the models on, it looks like crossbow spam that is very common. people also orb spam that very same path. with models on, u can see that he has the crossbow out and ready to shoot before the combine model becomes visible. doesnt change my opinion. looks like spam to me.<br>
<br>
tic 20700... ive addressed this one before. w/o models on, audible nade cook from right just as NG is moving into back mag. he takes a last second shot toward the nade sound before the bars block the shot. with models on, it does look suspicious and for some reason i cant hear the nade cook as well. but i think i hear a spawn instead. if we had confused and z's demo's, i could confirm that. which again would lead me to believe it was two audible cues.<br>
<br>
tic 35750... w/o models on, it looks like nade spam towards the ramp that was lucky. with models on, it looks suspicious, but... NG has primed and cooked the nade before the combine model becomes visible at 35859. that reinforces to me that he was spamming the nade and got lucky.<br>
<br>
tic 68800... w/o models on, NG kills z under red room. goes up the hill, up pipes, into bathroom. audible spawn from right. NG launches barrel towards back shotty (ledge spawn), goes out onto the bridge and launches a cooked nade towards back shotty again. with models on, it would seem to disprove a wall hack. the combine model spawns in sewers and is clearly visible near stairs while NG appears to be attacking back shotty (ledge spawn) area.<br>
<br>
nino, i have no problem with sharing what ive written here in this thread whenever you decide to rule on this. im sure i'll be ridiculed for my opinions, based on being unskilled and an admin noob. but i dont really care. its my opinion and i think i've justified it fairly.
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>i dont remember seeing a crash on the stv demo's, but i didnt specifically look for one. i watched the actual match on stv and remember chat at the beginning of round 2 asking NG what he did between rounds. seems like NG said he crashed, and Z or Confused were like... mhmmm, sure. if its noticeable at all, it may be in the chat at the beginning of round 2.</div></blockquote>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>you know, demo's can be a strange animal sometimes. the first night i watched that particular tic from grains personal demo, i could actually see the combines full body with the cooked nade come into view just as grain shot. i watched, listened and replayed that a half dozen times or more.<br>
<br>
the next night i watched it with r_drawothermodels 2, and the combine model never makes it into the final kill view. even after changing back to r_drawothermodels 1, the combine never entered grains view... it was a blind shot.

Well as you see from the admins we wanted confused demo's to check a few things from a different angle.  I didn't really want to make a conclusion without them but it's been forever and you will not send them.  So i guess it is over with.<br>
<br>
To the others saying this is beating a dead horse,  people need to dispute if they feel someone is cheating/exploiting/hacking.  How else would you stop it from happening?  Thanks to the a group of admins we had, they spent o lot of time looking through the demos.<br>
<br>
I deleted the thread cuz public really isn't the place for discussing disputes.  I so sorry you got 5 matches that looked like fun.  In a dead period of hl2dm's history.<br>

	<div class="content">Chem, a formal dispute was filed for the finals match for the DMU tourney one day after the match was played.  It had nothing to do with CAL or that dispute.  It was a seperate issue and treated as such.  <br>
<br>
The admins requested Grain's personal demo from that match only, nothing more. We got one from the first round cause he said he crashed during the second.  We watched that one. The tourney admins (myself, Cellar and Sacrafist) reviewed it because they are the admins and that is their job.  Nino asked someone he knew that was a former ACS admin to look at them, I assume because of the guy's experience with this sort of thing.  If you think I wanted to spend the better part of a week analyzing that demo instead of playing or working on my map, think again.  <br>
<br>
 We asked for Confused's and then Zmans demos to see a different pespective but we never got them which is one reason this took so long to post a resolution.  Some of us did watch the sctv demos but as I stated earlier they are not the most accurate record of a match.<br>
<br>
No offense taken but I have been playing this game a long time and I have seen examples of hax in this game and I think I can decide if funny shit is going on.  Who would you have review the demos?  No way would anyone from EE/EWR or Pancakes/SW would be allowed to.  In fact, Confused was removed from the conversation altogether.<br>
<br>
Personally my comment when the dispute was filed was that this whole situation was pretty sad indeed for some of the reasons you state: DM is pretty much a dying game that a very small group of us gives a shit about and its not like there was anything valuable at stake with this tourney, not even a lousy trophy.<br>
<br>
I do have to agree with Nino that if someone I suspected of hacking, it should be looked into but usually it comes about only in a league/tourney format.<br>
<br>
As for Warzone and the players there.  Its a separate venue and has nothing to do with this issue and none of the people that ran the DMU tourney had anything to do with who is in Warzone or any decisions made for it.  You make some valid observations but you need to take that up with the Warzone admins/management.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

thats fine, let them get a new account, oh i was refering to ppl that have been vac banned and have new accounts anyway, and then submit demos until they have passed a certain time period.  all the demos dont have to be reviewed, maybe just random picks or if somebody files a dispute.  and this quote...."The problem with that L2K is how much of the community wouldnt be able to play?  "  i like you a lot para, and have a lot of respect for you, but that is just so rediculas i cant believe you said it.  so ppl who have been caught cheating can play because we need to fill spots?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Sorry Chem, but I do believe that people can make mistakes and change their ways.  Maybe that is silly of me.   <br>
<br>
How many people are we talking about anyway?  I really have no idea how many there are to be honest.  Would you like to volunteer to review 3-5 demos each week?  Reviewing demos to make sure people who were vac banned from another game to make sure are keeping thier nose clean in a free play league where the winners get nothing is not something I am willing to spend my time on plus run a league.   If you really feel that strongly about it, you can start a list of people that have ever been vac banned on any of their accounts and be our Vac Ban watchdog and tell us not to let them play.  Oh BTW you have to have proof that a previous vaced account was theirs, so there is no BS about who it really was or wasnt.  Some of them we obviously know but for the rest can you get proof?<br>
<br>
The simple fact is that I would run a league for the good of the game and the community but I dont want to just be a league slave.  I would like to be able to play once in a while too.  Being a league admin, reviewing 3-5-10(?) demos each week and/or tracking all known DM players that have ever been vaced is too much for me to handle. <br>
<br>
So you want to take the time to be the Vac watch dog and /or review demos of matches each week?  Anyone else feel that strongly about it?  Is it really worth it for you?  I am not willing to do it so someone else step up.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Right, Pure 2 disallows all custom sounds, textures, and models.  Your xhair and hud are the only things that I know of that you can change.  It's just like Holy's hi res pack and the Rick Roll rpg sounds (which I sincerely miss using btw and can't find them).  Replacing wall textures with see through textures won't work with Pure 2.  Even if someone did use clear textures on Pure 0 servers, they would have to have a set for every map since most maps use different textures for different things.  Anything else that would allow you to know positions on a Pure 2 server would be monkeying with code and that gets you the mighty hammer of VAC.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

you're not always going to be the best. you're eventually gonna come across someone who has better reflexes, more precise aim and possibly more gaming experience than you.<br>

	<div class="content">Sorry to bursts $W's bubble, looks I already did that because LukeGT is oversensitive and removed me from friends for ribbing on Confused for lying for the 4th time, but I used to think Nutri hacked too (I even collected and reviewed demos with Seagull). Eventually, I played enough scrims against him, some I even won (without PB tho) and found he generally plays the same way everytime, and the demos I watched mirrored how he usually plays. I viewed the demos objectively, and honestly saw nothing there. Now I know it's a fashion trend in the community lately to make accusations of hacking, *cough LukeGT, Zman, Divinity* and more I'll leave nameless for politeness, but I'm tired of you guys, specifically SW members accusing anyone who plays better then you of hacking. How many times have I had to defend Hertz, vapor, blas, and now that I've scrimmed them enough times to see their just not hacking, PB and nutri.  You guys are old talent, get over it, the new styles and the brain of a high IQ 15 year old are too much for you now and I'm tired of seeing hacking or rate exploit accusations, whether public or private against a multitude of newer players specifically from mostly $W members. Divinity is an exception of a person who is not $W to take it that far, but at least he went out in fire and flames and hasnt come back.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Fire and flames eh? I've never publicly said any1 hacked I've heard things and have seen suspicious activity, yes, but I haven't gone as far as to say so and so hacks and is a hacker. <br>
<br>
There are countless ppl more skilled than me that I don't accuse of anything. I've just seen weird stuff in some scrims I did w/ both blast and voz. I talked to blast personally about what I thought and I've shown some ppl a demo of a match I did w/ voz to get their personal opinion on it. <br>
<br>
I haven't seen every glitch or w/e this game has so when I do see something I never came across I'll try to find a reason for it. <br>
<br>
I do still play this game but only  w/ ppl who are cool and are rage-free, it's what makes the game a lot more fun IMO.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

when was the last time I accused someone of cheating? I just try to play and improve without saying much.

cool story bro. glad to see that you want us to get better @_@. I believe that ninjins hit the nail on the head though. I feel that there is a persona that some people have that just makes you play worse, if you let it get to you. I think the next goal is to be unaffected by it. I suggest everyone take a stab at that one, might see some interesting improvements <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>

	<div class="content">@Luke, EDIT:: Yeah I do remember removing on accident while I was drunk in a feeble attempt to remove someone else right below your name, my apologies I admit I was kind of angry at the thought you removed me. Anyway, @Div, lol is about all I can say. I guess if I ever want to play with you I'll be looking for a player named Ben Affleck playing in the killbox stats server owning all the tough competition over there. I think just about every top player had known what you did, so thinking your accusations would never be made public was kinda naive and the story told to me was you accused several players of hacking, I guess the story got skewed by the time it reached me ;*(. Anyway quti whining and play me and blas again, although I don't blame you, it's been awhile since you guys last won against us, you can hang on to the match in the tourney all you want but we've won what, 8 straight scrims since then? pzpzpzpzpz get raged son.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

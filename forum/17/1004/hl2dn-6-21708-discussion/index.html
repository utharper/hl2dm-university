Well.....what maps do we want to do?<br>
I personally am not fussy over what maps so long as I have em on my server if its needed.  The only thing is they have to be large enough maps to accomodate 8 players.  I wouldnt mind trying out a non CAL map if server operators can get the map on their servers.   Might be a good way to see if there are other maps that might be good for CAL in the future.  One that comes to mind is dm_Octagon.<br>
<br>
I think the start time is good (6PM eastern),  We ended at 11PM last time with the final round.  Some people thought that was long.  I would ask that teams dont stay afk too long between rounds and matches so we can keep it flowing.<br>
<br>
Picking the teams takes time plain and simple.  If people make sure they are in Vent by 6:15 then we can have enough to start picking earlier.  I dont think the system is flawed, its that alot of people showed up late and we had to start late because there werent enough people.  <br>
<br>
I was kinda ticked that the team we played the final with was not the team that started.  I think 3 of them were subs.  It kinda defeats the purpose of a team.  Not sure what the solution is there.<br>

its a large map, but you have a week to download it... i dont want to discourage people from playing a map if its good because its large, its not like lostvillage_v2 or what ever, where theres an original of half the size and better textures...<br>
<br>
vault is way to damn small, and with all the deadends.. makes a better 1v1 map then anything team based, i'm not a swamplight fan either, but it is in cal and a decent team play map.<br>
<br>
i just think we should be introducing people to new maps, even if cals not running them, as long as they fit the bill right?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yea i can get to the rpg 2 times out of three but its getting back that i have not mastered and people say it easier getting back  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> . I know a clan that in scrims can get the rpg every time and dominate in that map with it. There are also some orb tricks and crossbow shots you can do in that map.

If the easiest part is getting back O_O I need to work on that xD<br>
I seriously consider getting back the hardest.<br>

This map is a great choice IMO, just be sure you have HDR lighting off when playing :S I found out the hard way.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I say that because the file size is HUGE, not many people will wait for 5 minutes for a map to dl that they've never played before.  At least that was my experience when I put it on my pub back in the day.  I'd have a full game going, map would change to dm_octagaon and the people would drop like flies, and boom 10 person ffa turns into a 1v1.  Don't get me wrong dm_octagon is definately one of my all time favs, its file is just ginormous.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

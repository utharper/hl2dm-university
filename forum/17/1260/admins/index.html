	<div class="content">Well sorry I was on my way back from the beach from the weekend and got caught in some traffic and didn't make it back in time, i got on at 6:30pm est and imo it wasn't worth starting late,  as most people that play in the draft show up right at 6pm and if someone doesn't take charge and keep everyone into the draft people will leave.  <br>
<br>
So i ask for anyone that enjoys the draft to please join me and be an admin for the draft, it's really not that hard all you have to do is keep everyone calm while you search for 16 to 32 players.  You don't need them all on you friends list just be part of the steam groups: draft night group, Hl2dmU group, hl2dm scrimmage group etc you can see everyone online from there and message them to join.  <br>
<br>
Also we could possible work in some different days and times with other admins.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

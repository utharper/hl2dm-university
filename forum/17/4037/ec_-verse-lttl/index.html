Not in this tourney that's all I know. The new jaegar will morph from LV style play to camp basement with orbs and have low frag counts. Thus since SynGold just racked 200+ in one match having 911 play the new jaegar would be unfair in their quest to keep up with SynGolds frag count. Also, all I can say is I hope all these maps are scrapped for the contest maps + caverns. Warlock= admirable but terrible spawns with bad weapon placement, too narrow. Mil= sloppy, 1st Jaegar was rough, second jaegar was LV. version 2.0, the third will be one team camps upper, one team camps lower boring shotgun whorefest. Bio is just fucking old, no reason it should have been there in the first place.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

As for maps goes, the voting could've been done in a better way of course. As people have previously stated, only those who were playing should be the ones voting. Hopefully we'll get it right next time in a future 2v2 tourney. I guess as the results showed, people wanted something opposite of maps CAL offered and that's what they got.<br>
<br>
Jeager RC2 is interesting can't say i hate or like it but I do like the room and openness it offers. Ya ur health will be low lots of the time cuz health is scarce but hey at least it's not OVERWATCH.   Also, Warlock didn't have bad spawns in my recollection and the weapon placement was fine IMHO but ya it did favor the shottyboombalottie. <br>

i had the same experience.  i think pb racked up about six straight spawn kills w/o moving an inch from the crossbow spawn by the charger.  i swear one time V spawned in the same spot just as i died.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>

<br>
Disappointing to see there was a bad response to jaeger's gameplay.  RC2 was a mess I admit, the RPG is far too easy to camp, plus the other limitations.<br>
<br>
As far as jaeger is concerned, RC3 is not the final version, jaeger is still a work in progress until I get it right.  I've read the comments carefully and will be taking notes and hopefully this will reflect in the final release.<br>

1) mapper can't control if you spawn in the same spot twice or more in a row - the game goes.<br>

Why bother? I was forced to. These maps aren't going to played widely when the tournament ends, and will only continued to be played if ninoj puts them into the next cup, which he probably won't. Also I've never spawned in one place three times in a row on ANY map, and never had had so many twice in a row spawns, I don't understand why this occurs so frequently on Mil, someone could help me out with that one. I did learn the weapon spawns on Warlock btw, it's the fact that when people camp the armor area, and you spawn in the middle of that your options are to run down a long area on the left side for the shotgun in the grate, which is usually taken or you just die trying to get it, or you run toward the cave entrance, but usually get sniped, or you run down an even longer hallway on the right side, and WILL die always.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

this sort of sums it up for me as for the angle of your comments and where you're coming from. i've never seen the problems you describe above or was reported on by others. the spawn issues looks like a bug which i have never experienced. not in milieu not anywhere else. <br>
as for the weapond or item pickup layout: a map has a certain flow to it you either take to or you don't. not everybody like the same maps. but yea, true, lest we forget - if the council of DM will mark a map then bullcrap maps will be glorified for all times as the sauce of sauce. and don't we know it. in truth ALL maps are flawed, including lockdown and lost village, caverns and zeta. just depends WHO like'em and WHO crits'em. now aint it the truth?  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Agreed entirely. It is weird to see a good map created and then rejected by the community because of who doesn't like it, yet a mediocre one can end up being the crowd favorite for a long time. I guess that's the way things go sometimes :/ <br>

Valar's maps are good, even great visually and environmentally, like nothing else. The way intense high caliber play pans is a diff story IMO. The maps ARE all flawed from LD to Jaegar_rc3, there is no perfect map. However it's illogical that just because me, or anybody else in the competitive play arena dislikes a map then the community will dislike it. LD and LV were popular for such a long time because people simply liked playing it, to say otherwise is BS. All across the board in competitive play clans, deep down when we want to play for fun, we always want to revert back to LD, Zeta, Caverns, and Bio the maps are popular or not popular not just because we say so, but because the larger community and us feel that there is a certain fun factor these maps have. Of course there is a large amount of people who say the maps I just mentioned above are bad, but the MAJORITY still loves them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Actually, a long time ago the maps were good too. Powerhouse, swamplight, avalon, amplitude, backbone, overwatch so many others I'm forgetting were good. Back when there were no forums and, and hl2dm was a pub based community with hundreds of players on every night and pub players never knew about the opinions of l33t player gods; guess what maps were the most popular? Almost consistently the most popular maps went in this order, ctf_any (I.E. ctf_2fort_b1, ctf_avant, ctf_rock2) dm_lockdown then dm_lostvillage. Any old school pubber can attest to those almost always being the most popular maps, even though there were back then believe it or not alot of good alternative map selections too! Even now lockdown remains one of the most popular warfare arena maps. Least you forget Valar, the council of DM put stamps of approval on your maps, introducing them into CAL, warzone and the 2v2cup and months later almost nobody wants to play these maps for scrim funs, and are not popular maps on Warfare, SW central or 911's pub server, maybe you should look past the councils approval of your maps and see your maps aren't that great either.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

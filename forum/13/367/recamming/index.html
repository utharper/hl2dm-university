	<div class="content">Ok, <br>
<br>
So I'm puttin the final touches and tweaks on my fragvideo, and wanted to add a couple of recams here and there... Now, I think I've mastered the art of recamming quite nicely, although I'm working with player recorded demos, no Source TV demos...<br>
<br>
My question I guess is, does anyone know how to prevent the camera from bopping everytime I strafe jumped or bunny hopped ingame? It's really annoying and preventing me from adding recams to a couple of really nice xbow bounces...<br>
<br>
Greetz and thanks in advance,<br>

	<div class="content">Yeah that dude in the video tutorial said, later I'll go on explaining what you can do about certain bugs in the engine for recamming, like when your model crouches so will the camera... But I watched the entire video and he never got around to it... ROFL!<br>
<br>
Pincus told me:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>So changing cl_interp 0.015 fixes the issue, apparently. I say apparently because I haven't personally tried it out myself.</div></blockquote>

He said he had e-mailed Valve about this issue and they said that command should fix it... Now I can be wrong, but it didn't at least not for me, or maybe I forgot additional commands, I don't know... <br>
<br>
The fagvideo won't have that extra 'wow' effect if I don't add at least a couple recams... :[</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah, the interp thing doesn't work. What we're doing with the VDuS frag video is just removing the frames where it was bouncing around, but sometimes it doesn't work and we just cannot recam it. If all else fails, try getting another person's demo who was in the same game at the same area during the frag and recam it from his position (maybe he wasn't jumping at the time, etc)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Removing frames, hmmmm interesting but won't the clip actually be more choppy then leaving the jumping frames on?<br>
<br>
And yeah I thought of it, getting demos from other teammates, but what player this day and ago in this game doesn't have some sort of movement... They all bunny hop lol!<br>
<br>
Thanks for the answers guys, I'll try and do the best I can with what I got and hope it looks alright...<br>
<br>
Thanks again, it's been really helpfull.<br>

	<div class="content">I'll experiment with some things tomorrow, WT.<br>
<br>
I guess making a clip of a recammed shot, would look horrid in realtime (30 fps)... That's why I would opt for a slow motion (90-120 fps) clip of bounced shots... Wich would make taking out 2 frames, fairly invisable.<br>
<br>
Although holymoly had a really great idea too, using an interpolation... If it turns out to be something usefull I'll make a little tutorial for the whole issue...<br>
<br>
Give me some time though, been rather busy lately! ^^<br>

	<div class="content">Basically what seagull said,   When I extract from console, i'll find the frames that jump and delete them, the result is a very minor skip in footage, about .3 - .5 seconds, its noticable, but only if you're doing slow motion, other than that you would never know the difference.<br>
<br>
If its a 2v2 or somthing and the other guy has a demo, splice in the footage from his POV or even splice in the frames that need to be replaced if its getting really technical, again, only slow mo is where you would wanna get this technical, at 30fps, you could blink and miss it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><strong class="text-strong">HL2DM - MORE THAN A GAME <span style="font-size:4%;line-height:116%">2</span> </strong><br>
An individual frag video by A-Master¹ aka A¹<br>
<br>
Presenting frags in Half-Life 2: Deathmatch of Valve Software<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Length: 12:22<br>
Filesize: 471 MB/431 MB<br>
Codec: x264/XviD</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
This video contains some of my best frags from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008. Actually, the first clip was exported from demo file to raw AVI on 8.10.2007 and the latest one on 26.12.2008. That day I also started editing it with video editor and finished editing in the beginning of 2009 so the editing process itself wasn't very long. Just needed the time to make it. My uncompressed frag clip folder was over 330 GB, final edited uncompressed video file was 76,4 GB and the final compressed file was about 450 MB.<br>
<br>
None of the frags are staged. The footage is from clan matches, pub, 1v1 and 1v2 matches. I just wanted to show cool frags and make the video fluent, not showing who I have killed. If you want to know, I can mention that the video features players from clans SF, XE, eS, HL2P, Sa.Fr... for example.<br>
<br>
Remember, it's about <span style="text-decoration:underline">YOU</span> (the players!) if the game is going to live or not. Don't let it die, just keep fraggin'! Long live HL2DM. The best deathmatch game ever made.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy the movie (:<br>

<br>
The x264 version has the best quality but it won't play well on all poor computers. This is my second frag video. I didn't want to make it too long and I'm sure some of you may think it's too short then :p Remember there are also frags during teh credits ^^,</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah, that's pretty different. It was caused because I started exporting the clips in that way so long time ago to avi and didn't think everything so carefully back then.

* Intro, while nice, was a bit on the long side, I was anxious to get the action and prefer to see videos keep it under a 1:30.<br>
* Loads of lockdown footage, while the kills were good, I would have liked to have seen a bit more variation in maps. I understand that if that is what you play mostly, then it is a given you will get your best frags there.<br>

I just didn't think the frags were all that great. I like seeing lots of intuitiveness in a frag. I didn't see a lot here. I only remember seeing 5 or so. I'm not a big fan of run and gun in videos. I like seeing crazy xbow banks and stuff that I haven't really see before. I did like the lockdown one where you grabbed the grenade and drug it along the floor. <br>

	<div class="content">Its is not a trick shot movie most think that a hl2dm movie should do this but it should not have to be. A movie should not always contain mid air nads and crossbow bank shot to be considered a good movie.<br>
<br>
In this movie you have straight hit them hard and fast so to speak which is a style different from other that I have seen that try and mimic onti frags not saying that a bad thing but like to see something different for a change. One thing that stands out to me is the use of radiator used very creatively can only think the guy that got killed was thinking "how the f did he get there!!! that hacker". <br>
<br>
On editing was really good he keep it clean but edited very effectively with nice slowmos plus the intro was great. On the tracks had nothing wrong with it only second one i think i did not like that much but apart from that i liked it especially the one that i remember from blade where he owning all those vamps. <br>
<br>
stuff that could of improved**<br>
<br>
.remove the hud even if it a cool one it not needed<br>
.wanna see who he killing kill has more meaning when you know who is getting killed<br>
.should of used demos smooth for those camera flybys would of came out allot more smoother <br>
.some kills could of been removed that where not so special <br>
<br>
But in all this was a frag movie by a highly skilled played that did what a frag movie should do entertain two thumbs up. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/thumb.gif" width="25" height="18" alt=":thumbsup:" title="Thumbs Up"><br>

Editing is pretty clean, frags prove you got some mad skills. Even though there aren't much "show" or out of the ordinary kills like rpg/ricochets, those 180 degrees shots, and multiple fast kills get the job done really nice. You need to be more picky for the next time though, because there where some frags that were just plain normal, specially some 1 shot kills that weren't that amazing (like the first one D;). Other than that I really enjoyed the frag content.<br>
Music didn't call my attention much, but fit the video very nicely and was something I could hear without any problem, so well done again.<br>
The HUD! you already know this lol ... (I'm including the deathnotices on that complaint <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">)<br>

on a side note i thought shunny's comment was pretty funny.<br>
<br>
"ok first and foremost the 90% of the frags are very average ie next to no<br>
mid air kills very few xbow bounces and rpg curves. most of them are just<br>
straight aim kills which are very common with quite a few of the kills on<br>
players that looked terrible. quality was good but not many effects at all.<br>
personally i dont mind clean editing like that or heavy effects so that was<br>
ok with me. music i didnt like but again it was different for a change. for the<br>
length there was far to much biohazard and lockdown - 80% of the movie.<br>

sorely lacking."</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah thinking about that....<br>
I think I mislead some people into thinking what a "good frag" is due to my movies.<br>
I use lots of ricochets/mid air kills/rpgs for 2 reasons.<br>
1) I always loved them and show a pretty creative and dynamic side of the game.<br>
2) In my conditions, is extremely hard for me to play a 4v4. I'd say almost impossible. Same goes for 3v3. That left me with 2v2 and 1v1, and so it is not as easy to get the opportunity of doing quick frags killing sprees, multikills and stuff like that, so I had to rely on my few 1 shot kills that were good.<br>
<br>
This however, doesn't mean it's all you have to see on a movie!<br>
I think A-Master did well on the fragging sections, showing some pretty kick ass sprees. The fact that he didn't fill the video with ricochets and rpgs doesn't mean it's bad. Some players just play more "old school" or in a more classic way, but if they can win doing that and using pure skills, then bring it! It's also enjoyable to see that. I asure you not everyone can do some of the shots he did on the video (even though he could have left some aside that were pretty common...)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think I mislead some people into thinking what a "good frag" is due to my movies.<br>
I use lots of ricochets/mid air kills/rpgs for 2 reasons.<br>
1) I always loved them and show a pretty creative and dynamic side of the game.<br>
2) In my conditions, is extremely hard for me to play a 4v4. I'd say almost impossible. Same goes for 3v3. That left me with 2v2 and 1v1, and so it is not as easy to get the opportunity of doing quick frags killing sprees, multikills and stuff like that, so I had to rely on my few 1 shot kills that were good.<br>

In my opinion, getting 3 or 4 good kills in a row where people are shooting and running at you from all sides is more impressive than a single (and usually very lucky) bow bank.</div></blockquote>if only i would record matches....my frag vid would be so rape.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/cry.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":cry:" title="Cry"> <br>

shunnyboy stop making aussie's look bad, your vid sucked, this vid kicked its ass, pretty much most of the frags that were recorded in australia I know for fact were spent in your own lan dedicated server open to public, sending invites to the people who showed some sign of advanced skill to join you, with you spending hours in the same map trying to get frags against them. Then there's also the fact that you vsed people from other countries mainly the US got owned 30-2 which i witnessed at times lolol, and then adding those 2 average frags against them in your fag vid, god you suck. I've kept my mouth shut about all the bs until now but now that you started bashing A-Master for a brilliant frag vid he made which Is so much better than both of yours combined, I'm no longer. You play all of the worlds best players get owned by them then add the few frags you got on them which most of the time were less than average frags to your frag vid. A-Master didn't even show the names of the players who killed, but you don't understand why that is do you shunnygirl? that's because he wanted to entertain us with a brilliant frag vid concentrating on entertaining us instead of going look who I killed I'm so good at this game.<br>
Some of the frags from your first vid were even when me , robo_147, freaker etc were kicking back in a pub server talking and hopping around not killing, you joined and were pretending to be kicking back with us, doing trick shots every now and then killing us but after i saw your first vid then I realised the real reason you joined back then was because you wanted to record it, pathetic. Nowadays If I join your server or a server you're in or ask you through steam friends (through steam groups because I don't add faggots to my friends list) before I can even ask you for a 1v1 you'll either, leave, make up some excuse that you have to go, say you've just been playing 1v1's for ages and are now too tired, or you'll just fully ignore me pretending that you didn't see my message.<br>
<br>
shunnygirl stop coming here pretending you're all high profile and shit you suck, your frag vids sucked, I'll rape you in a 1v1 anytime, just send me a message, but you won't because you can't beat me.<br>

	<div class="content">He wanted to keep the original video not too long and avoid the trap that most fall for of making a long vid that will get boring .He probably did not use it since he could not find a place for them to fit in the tracks he was using and only choose stuff that sync with the music. I would guess there was pub footage in the first one but you can't tell since he removed the kill indicator.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

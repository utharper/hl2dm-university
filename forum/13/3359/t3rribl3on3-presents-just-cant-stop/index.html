this is a short frag video i made mainly from lan's over the last few months. i tried to capture what makes the game so much fun for me and why i just keep coming back to it. I advise you watch the high quality version or download it if you can.<br>
<br>

<br>
DL low quality - <a href="http://www.network-junkies.com/hosting/mdclan/fragvideo/jcs1.mp4" class="postlink">http://www.network-junkies.com/hosting/ ... o/jcs1.mp4</a><br>
<br>

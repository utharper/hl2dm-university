	<div class="content">Hello, I'm DarkHead.<br>
<br>
I want to say thanks because oyu've added my movie to your Frag Videos list with out I asked for anything.<br>
<br>
I'm making a new video with a story more developped. (NO FRAG STAGED don't worry ^^) So when I'll finish it, I'll give you a link to download it. =)<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, when I registrated, I entered darkhead as my nickname and it didn't work. It said "This nickname is disallowed" or something like that so if someone can change my nick to darkhead_  I would be happy. =D<br>

It was my first real video so I tried to make somethings decent but the problem is that it's too linear...<br>
<br>
In the beginning, only against Steph57300 and after against Daikichi etc but for the new one, I'll try to make something better.<br>
<br>
More maps, more frags, a little story, better quality, etc<br>
<br>
Thank you walking Target, I prefer my nickname that my team tag <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

You need to do the images with photoshop as far as I know, and then add them to the movie in each scene..... if you want to remove the hud completely, which means no frag notices ( you can't see the name of who got killed ), just write cl_drawhud "0" in console. If you wish to remove everyhting while leaving the name of the people killed use my hud remover.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There is a much better way to record.

Well yeah that's what I was talking about, I mean, you use the "hl2dm fonts" which have the weapon images, then with photoshop you give them that black things around the weapon, save the images as png, and later add it on sony vegas.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Will have to wait for the DL to tell you about quality.<br>
<br>
My recommendations:<br>
<br>
* Even if you use a specific crosshair in game, replace it with a single dot for frag videos with no brackets. This is the least distracting while still showing where the shot is.<br>
<br>
* Try not to run same maps together. Mix up the maps for more variety and to keep it interesting.<br>
<br>
Thoughts on frags:<br>
<br>
<span style="color:darkblue"><br>
Kills 1  - 5 are good.<br>
<br>
Kill 6 down hallway a bit ordinary.<br>
<br>
Kill 7 nice.<br>
<br>
Nade fumble... ?? Maybe save it for blooper reel/funny ending?<br>
<br>
Next hall kill is better because of the nice orb defense shown after.<br>
<br>
Sequence after that is a bit weird, a lot of dead air just to get killed by an orb and show the spawn defense. I would chop that clip to just one kill or the other.<br>
<br>
Next frag, cant tell if its xbow mag combo or just mag HS, decent frag either way.<br>
<br>
Direct orb to bridge area does not belong in a frag vid IMO, it's just too common for those kinds of kills in lockdown. I would cut it.<br>
<br>
Next sequence is strong, ending with a nice blind rpg curve. <br>
<br>
Sequence following is just mag kills and looks like average gameplay. I would cut this one.<br>
<br>
Same for next frag, if you had got a flying HS, it would be nice, but landing and getting a fairly basic mag kill finish does not really belong.<br>
<br>
Next frag, double mag kill on an opponent that is not really moving much is not great.<br>
<br>
RPG multikill is ok, but trim the clip down after the kill (I'm sure you will do this in editing).<br>
<br>
1st Lost village sequence is nice, even though you died you got a bunch of kills.<br>
<br>
2nd Lost Village sequence just looks like something you see in any lost village match. I say cut this one.<br>
<br>
3rd Lost village clip is nice, HS + free nade multikill + HS <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> </span><br>
<br>
I guess my opinion is that you have a mix of good frags with some ordinary ones (unless there is something I'm missing in this low res version).<br>
<br>
Soundtrack...first track was bad for me because that one riff was repeated over and over and over. i would try to find a track with more variety. Last track I assume was Rammstein (not 100% coz I dont listen to them). I think they are overused in frag videos, but at least it wasn't Du Hasst. Maybe find a different band?<br>
<br>
Hope this wasn't too much lol, and it's only my opinion, so you don't have to agree with everything I say and change it all up. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"> <br>

I still don't know.. xD<br>
<br>
<br>
I think you are right, I always take usefrags.. For the kills in the 2 first lostvillage sequence, I wanted in editing to add like in the cyn^vid, an icon of the kill with a color to difference a normal kill and this shitty tk :p<br>
But it's not so original... ^^<br>
<br>
I love the third lostvillage clip, that's why I add it but I don't find the demo xD... And the res' and quality isn't good :/ I'll see if I can change anything.<br>
<br>
I go to record it back but with out fraps and HUD at this time <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
BTW I've removed the brackets 'cause it bored me in game and I'll change the crosshair to the dot =)<br>

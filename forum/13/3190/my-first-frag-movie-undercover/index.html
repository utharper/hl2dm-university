Hello!<br>
<br>
I've seen a lot of great videos like unwonted 2,addicted to kill2 by perfect gamers,and I decided to make one.<br>
I tried out Sony Vegas before,but I couldn't do anything with it.But now, I did something.I made my first fragmovie,on my own.<br>
I've tried to make the editing good,I put in some classic frags that from 1on1s,2on2s,3on3s and cu wars.<br>
<br>
so, i dont need say more, hope you can enjoy my first frag movie;D not the best i think but good luck x)<br>

	<div class="content">I usually don't comment on videos and dislike it when I read negative comments, but since I wasted my time/bandwidth downloading this I feel as if I have some right... First of all what's with all the spawn kills? If you're going to make a video to showcase your skills then at least show that you have some skill, not make a video with about 20 spawn kills in it, they're all really really really lame and boring.<br>
<br>
The first section reminds me of watching an old VHS with the extreme brightness/blurriness and the tracking going funny every minute, pretty poor use of effects. There is no consistency either, every section seems to look different, at some points is looked like Aim was full bright  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

Did you really need to add that RPG kill against Luke? or did you just add it because it was Luke? I know it was round a corner (kind of) but to anyone that's seen Blow Away this is nothing.<br>
<br>
Sorry if this is all a bit harsh, but I after seeing Onti's and SW's videos I expect something a little more creative and this just didn't do it for me.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

would have to aggree with jelly's comment 100%, the aim spawn killing was stupid, not sure why you would put that in a frag vid.  the rest was just meh, after all the frag vids, seeing the same types of kills(xbow bank shots, rpg round the corner shots) this didnt stand out much.  2 things i did like tho.  1-the rpg shot on aim that bounced the mag right to you, (assuming that was an accident) 2-you rocked NIN.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Constructive critisism coming!<br>
-don't use the clockwise transition on a black background as u did several times<br>
-@ 0:33 you can see the xbow upside down (demo bug). You gotta delete that frame on virtual dub or sony vegas.<br>
-Be careful with the color settings you use. Many frags were either too dark or too brigtful, making it hard to enjoy the video.<br>
-Don't change between song with the black background and such big pauses!<br>
-between 1:15 and 1:23, u did a smooth on lockdown and later showed a frag on aim arena. That has no coherence. It would have worked much better if you smoothed around aim arena and ended up reaching the same place where you were in aim, and transitioning from the smooth to first person.<br>
-Don't use that wave effect on frags (which u overused btw).<br>
-I like spawn kills, cuz I really never learnt the spawn points and I tend to remember them when I see them on a video ;P , however, they would have fit so much better if you speeded them up and synced them with the music.<br>
-in the song "if it wasn't for you", every strong "you" on the chorus should be synced to something! You only did that on the first one with a mag shot, which is slightly out of sync btw ;P<br>
<br>
Understand I gotta tell you all this to help you improve, don't take it wrong.<br>
See my lsd video, compared to my last one is a complete disaster, but hey! that's how you learn :&gt;<br>
Some pretty good shots on the video, you just need to present them better <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>

All these guys are just fucking bored of everything. And lol, each time they see a new post they hope to see THE hl2 movie of the year. But sorry guys but with the very good ones we had like unwonted 2 or addicted to kill 2 or also the SW's one, now its gonna be really rare. You really expect too much ^^<br>
<br>
<br>
And well I post here cuz I did a HL2 vid one day (which is on the site btw) and I know some comments are from players who did 1 too, but Im not sure its the case for everybody. So bad comments from lazy guys who do nothing except bringing their stupid comments like "omg I have wasted my time" (whereas the guy lose 50 hr / week on HL2) or "omg I have wasted my bandwith" (whereas their internet provider make them pay the same ammount of money each month cuz it doesnt depend on bandwith in most of the countries). Well all that make me laugh when I realise how stupid it is and all that make me not laught when finally I see some good frags, a vid which is made for fun and manage to do it, a work behind too, but so fucking sensless comments disrespectful after.<br>
<br>
<br>
So yes man your vid is not the best ever seen. But you already know it. But I dont have any shame to say its a good one. I appreciate it. Ok the wave effect is used too much time but there was some good ideas and nice frags. I appreaciated the kill with the 357 which was just thrown previously at you. Excellent 1. I appreciated the good serie of HS at a moment too. And the respowns are not boring at all, they just prove how much you know the maps.<br>

Not everyone is hard on people's frag vids. It can be discouraging at times, but it is also good to get honest feedback sometimes, even if it is hard to hear. The nature of this forum is one where we try to make better frag videos, so you kind of have to have thick skin in order to post your movie here.<br>
<br>
I thought your movie was pretty good DDF, I wouldn't have uploaded it otherwise, and it had some unique elements in it. The idea is not to get upset, but to take the criticism in stride and go away and make an even better video (assuming you plan to make more than one).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

All these guys are just fucking bored of everything. And lol, each time they see a new post they hope to see THE hl2 movie of the year. But sorry guys but with the very good ones we had like unwonted 2 or addicted to kill 2 or also the SW's one, now its gonna be really rare. You really expect too much ^^<br>
<br>
<br>
And well I post here cuz I did a HL2 vid one day (which is on the site btw) and I know some comments are from players who did 1 too, but Im not sure its the case for everybody. So bad comments from lazy guys who do nothing except bringing their stupid comments like "omg I have wasted my time" (whereas the guy lose 50 hr / week on HL2) or "omg I have wasted my bandwith" (whereas their internet provider make them pay the same ammount of money each month cuz it doesnt depend on bandwith in most of the countries). Well all that make me laugh when I realise how stupid it is and all that make me not laught when finally I see some good frags, a vid which is made for fun and manage to do it, a work behind too, but so fucking sensless comments disrespectful after.</div></blockquote>

yea not like me to do that I usual give a pretty indepth review bit in truth i cba to download it seeing that shunnyboy was the mentor on this and first review was not all that great so i did bother downloading it. I may of had a look it there was a stream there is utube hd now and other sites. I decided only to download stuff that is worth the away time from my playing to download the movie.<br>

Don't agree they great movies but they are not the ceiling of what can be achived if you look at css movies there is a very high level of editing and if had actaul looked at watching play footage of css its boring but yet editing is a such a high quality that it entertains.  <br>
I think what other guys where telling is that if this was posted before let say game over then yea it would be get good reviews but its here and now that matters and the standard of video coming out are getting better that because knowlage being spread between video makers. Plus with after effects and list of tuturials you can make it look good but there is of course taste which realy can't be taught but there is does and don't. <br>
anyway all reviews should taken postive way its very hard to pull of a good frag movie and as a movie maker you got to listen to your audience it is to entertain thats the whole goal of it. Listen and learn and improve.<br>
<br>
ohh btw A1 about to release more than a game 2 can't wait for that.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Ok, just watched it. I think people are being a little hard on it. Effects overdone I agree, but the quality was good and there were some interesting kills in there. Nothing wrong with a bit of spawn monitoring either IMO, it is how competitive games are played after all. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"> <br>
<br>
Overall I'm giving it 7/10. Not the greatest movie released, but also a solid first effort and I can tell a lot of time went into making it. -1 for no credits/closing clip also.<br>
<br>
My advice scary is that if you make another, ease back on the effects and try to make them stand out less. In other words, you notice the effects more than you can see the kills. Save the fancy effects for slow motion replays or transitions perhaps.<br>
<br>
If people could look past the effects they would see that this could be a solid little vid. I liked the opening especially, right into it and the intro words stamped on the map walls looked way cool.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
WT It's just in my 1st post I say I'm disgusted about the hard comments cuz I thing the vid remains good. Then you answer me that the truth has to be said even if it's hard to hear. And then you watch the movie and say here that the comments were hard and it remains a good vid...<br>
<br>
It has not been exactly said like that but I just give you the idea :]<br>
<br>
But well no matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And I can understand that people (not you WT) who have never been able to create something nice are frustated enough to post silly comments on the work of the other.<br>

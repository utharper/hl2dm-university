	<div class="content">When you use drive in the demo smoother and move the camera a distance away from your player nothing loads, only objects that you can see in 1st person view show. My question is if there is a way to set the game to load and show all players and objects at all distances <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_question.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?:" title="Question">  That way a frag video with awesome around the corner rpg shots dont end up looking like the Blow Me Away by MODaL video were nothing loads until the player that gets fraged turns into a ragdoll.

Well yeah, it's only in certain positions. A good amount of the time the model is still rendered, so wall hacks still make a difference, esp as the players gets closer.<br>
<br>
EDIT: It's also the reason I couldnt do a nice smoothed recam on that RPG kill in my video. You went out of vis as soon as you got 20 feet inside the building.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

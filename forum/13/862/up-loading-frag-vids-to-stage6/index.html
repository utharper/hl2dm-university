	<div class="content">Hi guys I know there are some really good quality frag videos out there but I and i think everyone does not like waiting for more than an hour to up load one nore those wants to use up 300mb of memory for one. <br>
So i have decided to make my own frag video but want as many people to see it with out having to up load it. I tho of up loading it to a video sharing website but i realized that they degrade the quality of it and is not in full screen. But then i realized i could up load it to stage6 which i do use allot and know that it almost DVD quality and quick buffing.<br>
So to get to the point i tried out up loading some frag videos to see if it worth it. well it is for the quality and time for the end user but they have t have the plugin for there browser to view it and u need to have two or one software installed to covert it to be uploaded.<br>
Here are some frag that have been upload it would be really great to have more for the hl2dm on this site.<br>
<a href="http://www.stage6.com/videos/search:hl2dm" class="postlink">http://www.stage6.com/videos/search:hl2dm</a><br>
<br>
So I guess what im saying is if U got some frag vids up load so more of us can enjoy it. I also will explain how to do it.<br>
<br>
Two or three things U will need<br>
Web player - <a href="http://www.stage6.com/download/" class="postlink">http://www.stage6.com/download/</a><br>
divx codex if U don't have it - <a href="http://www.divx.com/" class="postlink">http://www.divx.com/</a><br>
a easy way to covert them with Dr.divx - <a href="http://labs.divx.com/DrDivXDownload" class="postlink">http://labs.divx.com/DrDivXDownload</a><br>
<br>
got them installed Ok so lets start. <br>
First creat a account <a href="http://www.stage6.com/users/login/register/" class="postlink">http://www.stage6.com/users/login/register/</a><br>
<br>
Next convert the frag video to be up loaded by opening Dr.divx and click open input file<br>
<img src="http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/1802/startdivxnb2.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
then change quality to insane or lower if u want quicker buff time for the user and click encode. there are other options but i will leave it u to u to work them out. <br>
<a href="http://imageshack.us" class="postlink"><img src="http://img170.imageshack.us/img170/1441/divx2qd7.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
click resume button and it will go through the steps to encode it. It will take around 10mins to complete.<br>
<a href="http://imageshack.us" class="postlink"><img src="http://img142.imageshack.us/img142/9638/divx3pu8.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
locate the file and take note where it is<br>
<a href="http://imageshack.us" class="postlink"><img src="http://imtg256.imageshack.us/img256/7080/divx4hl1.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
now go to stage6 and login to your account and click up load<br>
<a href="http://imageshack.us" class="postlink"><img src="http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/2987/divx5wb7.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
browse and find the file and give it a name and click add<br>
<a href="http://imageshack.us" class="postlink"><img src="http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/4451/divx6ml9.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
after it uploaded now just wait for it to be verified which take 2mins and click publish<br>
<a href="http://imageshack.us" class="postlink"><img src="http://img183.imageshack.us/img183/4886/divx8bg4.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
Now just tag it up and save and publish.<br>
<a href="http://imageshack.us" class="postlink"><img src="http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/8854/divx9lb7.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"></a><br>
<br>
Ok thats it. Ohh and while doing this when encoding change some of the settings like bitrate to be higher and aspect ration to get better quality than the ones i up loaded and also I hope the people those vids  belong to don't mind me uploading them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I looked at the other multiplayer frag vids from other games and there are loads and for hl2dm there is only less than 6 it would be be great if there was more to show that this game is not dead. So I am asking if you got some frag videos on your computer can u upload it so that more of us can enjoy it and to show others how good this game is.<br>
<br>
Also if you ever can pull your self away from playing and you are bored there are these films you can watch <a href="http://litfusefilms.com/movies/" class="postlink">http://litfusefilms.com/movies/</a> they are pretty good <br>
I recommend summers day in city 17</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

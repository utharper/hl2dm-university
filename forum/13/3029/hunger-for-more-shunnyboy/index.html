<strong class="text-strong">Hunger for More (x264)</strong><br>
<br>
This video consists of frags by me (shunnyboy) from Half-Life 2 Deathmatch.<br>
Footage from public deathmatch, team deathmatch and 1v1, 2v2, 2v1, 3v1, 4v1, 6v1 scrims<br>
in Australian, North American and European Servers.<br>
<br>
Note: This video contains about 10-20% of highlight footage from my first frag video (Kick off)<br>
which was 87 mins and many did not see it! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

	<div class="content">its a 7/10 for me <br>
<br>
its good quality has some good kills with some good ideas<br>
<br>
but what draged it down from a possible 9 to me is it feels inconsitent not sure if any of you gets this but it felt like he learnt after effects from andrew tuturials and tryied and used every effect he know all in one frag movie this explains the some of the random effects like snow and constant change of colour schemes. Result was mesh mash its basicly ended up a blur to me when i try and think back about frag movie. Less would be more in this case. <br>
<br>
Also not very sure but the smooth where not done right it looks a bit choppy to me. mainly at the start where i think he tried to slow down the clip to much and recorded at not a high enuff fps that might be the problem.<br>
<br>
In all good job but try harder to shorten it a bit more and try and come up with a theme and stick to it thro out the vid. I know this can be hard like having 30mins worth of footage and you got try and resist the temptation to want to show it all because you thinkthey are all so great. Got to be more ruthless and set out a time 15mins three or 4 tracks and stick to it. There where some kills that may be should of been with out. Wonted is a good example the great kills come blow after blow after another one he did pretty well in filtering out the average stuff.<br>
<br>
anyway he has uploaded it to source radio somone just has to look at it and approve it. 21mins might put some peeps of from seeing it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I have very mixed feelings about this video...<br>
<br>
I just wish that you used your own ideas for once, you edit everything like other peoples videos, cmon man just have some creativity of your own.<br>
some frags in this vid are amazing but there is soo much pub footage... and whats with the random REALLY crappy frags vs. SW, ewR. and VDuS members? such as the mag shots and smg nad kills that have no significance whatsoever and are even less then average. Also the rcams are really shaky and look to be about 5 frames per second at some points, I dont even know if they were all rcams or not, some looked like you were just using the mouse...<br>
Now for the songs... I hated it all, all overused songs and a really shitty Kashmir rap remix at the end that forced me to turn off my speakers and actual put me in a bad mood just thinking about how someone could ruin such a classic song. Now I know you made this vid shorter so that people would download... but 21 minutes is still very long. <br>
<br>
no hard feelings I hope... but I'm gana be honest with you on this one</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

First of all, I think the editing is good. You don't have to zoom in on every other kill though. <br>
<br>
The frags are pretty much all the same. It's getting old quickly. It's xbow banks and mid air shots. I feel like some of the ricochets were staged. I've seen one or two new things throughout the entire movie. Every other ricochet I've seen before.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yea if it where a player in US or european I might agree to this but we keep in mind that he is in Austrilia he not in a clan (I think) hes does not compete in any leagues as far as i know so it understandable that most are pubs kills. <br>
<br>
Tho we all know we can all get crazy kills on pubs since most don't know how to move or play that well and chances are in a pub your more than likely to hit some thing with crossbow bounces. Thing is i won't mark somone down for pub kills it just that you got more respect for scrim kills against players that actually know how to play the game its more special.  <br>
<br>
Also allot of other peeps ideas where used like Briggs said, off the top of my head there was the scoop zoom like onty there was the google earth zoom from Andrew cramer tuturial where i think he used the actaul image used in the tuturial only that there is a cut out square on the last layer for the aimarena. I could go on and on with number of idea taken from others this is why im a bit ify on giving guys tuturials that i have found because sometimes they don't do anythink new with it they just copy and paste the damn thing.<br>
<br>
I really don't understand how peeps can be out of creativity when there only like a few frag hl2dm movies out there.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
ok just got done watching<br>
<br>
1) too much of those effects they sorta take away from the kills and sometimes simple is better<br>
2) repetitive banks and mid air smg nade shots<br>
3) crappy music<br>
4) some unoriginal recams that anyone could see where taken from onty and the sw clan vid<br>
5) useless smg nade and hand nade jumps thats one thing i didn't like in ontys vids either just for the fact it is merely more for show than skill<br>
<br>
overall i would give it a 6.5 out of 10 just because i can't really fault you for living in australia</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Yeah agree with this<br>
I felt like I was drunk and trying to focus on the frag, which I couldn't.<br>
I did like the shot from space, down to earth and into the map, that was cool.<br>
The thing about banks, are they cool? Yes, practical no.<br>
Were they staged? Probably some of them.<br>
 Otherwise you just filmed years of gameplay shooting random banks and getting lucky hitting something random on the otherside of the map every now and then.<br>
All the mid air smg nades and rpg shots, a little too much of this, but they are hard to land so you are aparently pretty skilled in that area.<br>
Overall still a bit too long, a bit repetitive in some areas and too many effects took away from the good stuff.<br>
Your on the right track though, just need to refine a bit.<br>

Anyway, good kills, a bit repetitive in some cases. Many don't seem so special because they are pub frags, and well some others are kinda too common. Like ... 1 kill with a grav-nade, or just a single xbow kill.<br>

Effects were cool, just a bit forced in some parts, and pleeease record in a higher frame rate for the slow motions! Otherwise it ends up looking all choppy.<br>

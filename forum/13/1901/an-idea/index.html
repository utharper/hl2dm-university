	<div class="content">i was telling nino a few weeks ago about all the demos modus and i have collected, and he said we should sit down, and take out the frags we want before the orange box update or we'd be screwed.... we have ALOT of demos, and i dont plan on starting to go over them any time soon, maybe after this season... but anyways, i had an idea.<br>
<br>
cant i just make a mod of my own, based off the hl2dm episode 1 fgd, and use it later even after the orange box update? seems like a pretty solid idea but i havent seen any other topics refering it?<br>
<br>
not only do i think it would be working after the orange box update, but then i can put all the high def shit, and movie configs as the mods default and not have to fuck with switching over when i just want to play?<br>
<br>
i need inpuuuuuuut.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

So I'm guessing you will still be able to play the current engines version of demo's.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">yeah I was going to say that someone made something so you could view old demos before the other updates (nino maybe) so I dont see why you wouldn't be able to do so after the OB update. At least I hope anyways, cause I dont plan on being able to get all the frags I wanted out of my demos before the update, but then again, I highly doubt the update will be ANY time soon.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I've pretty much just been exporting the frags I want from demos after matches happen... then again I got the HD space to do so.<br>
<br>
either way when the OB update happens I'm pretty sure they're going to beta it first, for a long time, like they are with DOD:S right now.  I'd say export like a madman then.  even after that, I'm sure the old engine will be available at least for a while so the old mods will still work.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

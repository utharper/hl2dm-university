	<div class="content">Hey guys just if someone you don't know movie vault holding their comp again. Been looking through them and have like 5 left to look at. From what I seen so far I not that impressed well no that would be lieing there are some really good work but it just the overall feel and quality of the entries is not that high of a standard that we saw in round 1. I think its mainly due to last time they did not releases all of the entries they had them judged and slowly released them starting with those that did not win then runners up then finalist which then went to a vote. But now you got 42 frag movies to look at yea I know sounds great but in practice its not I'm finding that I have to watch through some bad frag movies in order to pick out the good ones and it just diluting the experience. Im finding it very hard to remember some of them. <br>
<br>
Ones that do stick in my mind is canvas its just simply wow it the world he creates but sadly its a cs1.6 movie and well frankly it crappy graphics and and glitchy animations that just does not entertain me tho I would say more than anything its the editing at the start and end that hook me the most but frag action was never going to blow me away in 1.6.<br>
<br>
right now single gaming 3 is good I guess. There is another problem I have its the lack of other games competiting in this all there is is cs1.6 and css and a few cod:modern warfare but there never going to get proper vids from movie makers because well if I was say COD or TF2 movie maker I would not bother entering what the point I would know fully well I have no hope of winning because it a vote best vid is no the one that wins its the one that is the most popular so more likely going to be a cs movie. last round it was sync2 and I would not call that the best damn movie in round one it only won because it was a sequels everyone knows a sequels sell more. <br>
<br>
well I might have some more to say about them but i need to look back to refresh my memory anyway here the link and say what you think.<a href="http://www.sourceradio.com/modules.php?name=Vault&amp;page=BestDamn&amp;v=videos" class="postlink">http://www.sourceradio.com/modules.php? ... n&amp;v=videos</a></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

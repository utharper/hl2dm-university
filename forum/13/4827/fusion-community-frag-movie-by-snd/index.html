<br>
Ohh well might as well get this going. I want to do another frag movie but I simply am too shit now nor have the time play and create my own frags. So that leads me to community video route and there really has not been one for some time so why don't I do one.<br>
<br>
For those who have not seen my work have a look here <a href="http://www.themovievault.net/video/no-fear" class="postlink">http://www.themovievault.net/video/no-fear</a><br>
<br>
Basicly what I want to create is a short pacey frag movie with aggressive editing. I am really going to go all out on the editing on this one.<br>
<br>
So to summarize I want is you the community to give me your demos for me to create this movie.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0000"><em class="text-italics">Rules</em></span><br>
1. Frags submitted must have the tick of when the frag happens (shift+F2 demo console tick is shown)<br>
2. No pub footage. This is competitive frag movie only. funny clips are the only exception<br>
3. I prefer POV  demos but source TV is acceptable. (just that mag shots don't line up in source TV)<br>
4. No staged or faked or even cheated footage is allowed. Anyone that submits or even asks for such a thing will be named and shamed.<br>
5. Demos should be sent via pm through CU or steam or hl2dmu with download link.<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0000"><em class="text-italics">Example</em></span><br>
Frag: pwnage frag with mag<br>
File name: esvsraw_lock<br>
tick: 2300<br>
downloadlink: <a href="http://www.blablabla.com" class="postlink">http://www.blablabla.com</a><br>
<br>
<span style="color:#FF0000"><em class="text-italics">Working title</em></span><br>
give me some names and I pick the best one <br>

<br>
As you can see I now given a name to this community frag movie and now decided on a theme and style and even the track I am going to use.<br>
<br>
As already mentioned in this post this is a worldwide community frag movie that I am working on. The movie will be a short and pacey completely based around one track which I roughly estimate to be 6mins in total length. The editing is my main focus here where I am going to use a vivid colour palette based around Mirrors Edge which is inspiration for this movie. I want to show the magic and wow in the frags with close up slowmos and camera work.  <br>
<br>
Also if I seem like I'm out of touch it is because I am nearing the end of my degree so im usually lost in that work. Main plan is to finish my course and have a pile of footage to use to make the video with the free time I have. Thanks to those that sent their demos so far anyway keep recording those frags and sending them my way.<br>
<br>
Tks sch for being the prop in this screenshot.<br>
<br>
Also can someone move this to cafeteria so more can see this.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I still have the recordings, but I don't see myself finishing that movie, sorry <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad">   (the most I could do would be release what I had done, but still it's not more than 3 minutes I believe, and with no intro cuz when I asked for a pub demo, nobody on the whole forum was able to provide one U_U)<br>
I do believe I still have the demos, must look for them a bit because of all the pc formats, moving folders and stuff, but I surely have them. If you want me to send that stuff I'll upload it for you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

contrary to popular belief this is not dead. As said I have been busy with other things and have not got round to doing this project. That has changed now since I now have the time available to do this Movie. I have already started recording and logging the frags given to me so far and have started to play around with colour schemes and player bar. <br>
<br>
As things stand right now I don't have enough footage to make this movie and so do require more demos to get this done. So if you got some decent kills hand them over if you got some old demos of some epic battles between well known clans or players hand them over as well. Ticks are not required for the the last part I will look through them my self if there is anything usable. <br>
<br>
Update on what I am doing with this well I have selected the music to go with this which fits very well into the theme I selected with some great Japanese guitar notes that will create fantastic ambiances in the movie. Other thing is that unlike my other movie I am not going to use sony vegas and instead will be using adobe premier this should allow me to port things much more quickly between applications. But this will require me to learn a whole new program which I am prepared to do. <br>
<br>
Anyway I just leave these screenshots. Send more demos<br>

K I have been busy collecting and recording the footage sent to me which is looking ace. So far I have got 41 frags from 17 players. Here the players bars for the additional cast for this movie.<br>
<br>
I will now be working on trailer to explain what the movie is about and what sort of creative direction it will going with this. I will still be collecting footage during this process.<br>
<br>

Why is a known hacker's footage going to be in this frag video??? I mean, SND your frag video is going to be a worldwide frag vid showing what HL2:DM is all about right? Then why the hell is a hackers frag going to be in the video? I'm talking about Shuz/Shonty. Do we really want to show the world we support hackers? I'm not the only one who feels this way, and I mean no disrespect to you SND, you do great work, but seriously, everyone hates people who hack. People who hack give that game's community a bad name. I feel that his and all hackers footage should be removed form this and all frag videos that are going to be made in the future. If you need proof SND here is the thread: <br>

	<div class="content">What I find the most funny, is how you were dumb enough to even install hacks in the first place. Yea, speedhacks aren't as bad as aimbotting, but they are just that: HACKS. All people who install hacks in the first place who don't show they are truly sorry for what they did and act as much like little kids as you do (what are you about 10?) who doesn't show any remorse for what he did and acts like a lil spoiled brat should just stop digging a bigger whole and shut up. No offense kid, I'm sure your a nice person, but it's nobodies fault but urs, you installed the hacks, you used them (using ur real name gamer name, I mean c'mon, how dumb is that?!!?) now deal with the consequences or go play a different game. I hear sc2, css, tf2 have great tourneys, as well as super sf4. <br>
<br>
Just please, stop hacking period. The more you complain, the worse you make yourself look. <br>

P.S. The best part is, its the interwebs, you can go play some other game with a clean slate.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">lol dude, I speedhacked, which isnt even a real hack, in a noob pub server while you were aliasing on another account and recording me.  It didnt help me, I dunno why anyone would consider it hax, but more then 50% of the people there were my friends and I dont think anyone really cared other then you.  So then you started assuming i had aimbots and wallhacks because I know how to speedhack then you raged and called me a no talented noob that has to hack to win even though I can probably beat you without bhopping at all, and white combine.  So uhhh, this is basically you being mad, me having fun, and you posting it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Are you getting pissed at life when you must go through every demos on earth to find frags for your videos?<br>
<br>
WELL SEARCH NO MORE THE SOLUTION IS RIGHT HERE v If you're WAAAAY to lazy to read, there's a Tl;DR version of this tutorial at the bottom of the page.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Step #1 - Get some binds going, such as:</strong><br>
<br>
bind F1 "movie" <br>
bind F2 "movie2" <br>
bind F3 "movie3" <br>
bind F4 "movie4" <br>
bind F5 "stop"<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Step #2 </strong><br>
<br>
When you play, as soon as you get a sweeeet kill that makes you go "holyfuckingshit if i were to make a vid that'd be sooooo in!"<br>
hit F5 (stop) then hit f2, repeat the process.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Step #3 - Don't be lazy &gt;:0</strong><br>
<br>
As soon as your match is done, quickly alt tab and rename those demos , otherwise next time you press any of your binds, it will overwrite your previously recorded demo. And you don't want that now, DO YOU?<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Step #4 - "Today I'm makin mah vidioh"</strong><br>
<br>
Now is a good time to start makin that vid, you are on fire , with a reason.<br>
<br>
Go look at your demo folder.<br>
<br>
what once was "movie.dem" , you wisely renamed "leet_1v1.dem"<br>
<br>
so in that folder you have <br>
<br>
"leet_1v1.dem"<br>
"leet_1v1_2.dem"<br>
"leet_1v1_3.dem"<br>
<br>
You are then guaranteed that at the end of "leet_1v1.dem" and "leet_1v1_2.dem" there is a good frag you want to extract, "leet_1v1_3.dem" might just be the end of the match.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">Step #5 - That's all</strong><br>
seriously it doesnt get any more complex that this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
TL;DR<br>
<br>
every time you get a sweet frag, stop recording, start recording again ( add _2 _3 etc... after demoname) then at the end of each demo there will be a good kill, makin it easy to extract the good stuff.<br>
<br>

<br>
Most of my vids (~ 3 mins each) were all made within a day or two, that includes extracting kills,  editing,  exporting, uploading.<br>
Thank god for this method, too bad it doesnt work for league play as you must not stop your demos. at least it saves you from the scrim demos.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I am not sure this is fool proof. I think many of us would have our head so much into the game that we completely forget to stop and start recording during the game yet alone remember to rename the files. A true lazy guy would fail at this.<br>
<br>
<br>
My way is:<br>
<br>
1. Record every game with naming formate like this "&gt;map&lt;_&gt;opposite team or player name&lt;_&gt;date&lt;" all short handles names<br>
<br>
2. Just let it record no stopping needed just focus on the game and sort the stuff out latter <br>
<br>
3. Let the demos pile up and have a marathon run thro them all at 300% speed hitting the pause button when you see a good frag. Good idea to listen to music possibly those your thinking of using in the vid.<br>
<br>
4. Now recording the avi shots can be done in two ways you can record them then after open up virtual dub (do not close hl2dm just minimise it) and then extract. Another way is too record as many frags as you can then after extract them all. Downside to this is that you could easy forget the tic and demo the frag is (I will explain this in next step)<br>
<br>
5. Naming and storing the files. This can be a real time saver if you want flexibility and organisation to your work. The way I name them is in this formate "&gt;map&lt; &gt;description of frag in two words&lt; &gt; (demo name and tick of frag)&lt;". That way you can easy locate the frag in your demos if you wish to re-shot it in another angle of frame rate or even special setting like wire mode. You should create a number of files reffering to weapons and then killing sprees and bloopers.<br>
<br>
6. start editing <br>
<br>
video making is not for the faint hearted especially if you want to do a good job. Some frag movie take 2 months plus to do and usually first timers will take three times as long.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">When I know im going to play some really hardcore game and I dont want to stop here's an alternative<br>
<br>
<br>
YOU NEED:<br>
<br>
1- piece of paper, fuck recycling.<br>
<br>
2- something to write on it, pen or a piece of coal... anything works really.<br>
<br>
3- write demo name and play<br>
<br>
4- after getting a cool kill, hit timeleft and try to remember that, write it down when you die or something<br>
<br>
Then you'll know exactly where to skip, with demoui</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

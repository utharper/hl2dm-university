	<div class="content">Hey guys, I have created a HL2DM Trailer but it's a little on the large side at abt 450mb (n yes i did try n compress the arse off it!^)<br>
<br>
 I notice that you guys seem to host the downloads in ur frag movie section. ne chance of my uploading there?..........basic free rapidshare only allows upto 100mb :/<br>
<br>
if I'm able to get it uploaded I'll do a new post explaining the vid and its purpose etc.<br>

Maybe you can use holy-moly's guide to compress it, which trust me is really useful.<br>
Generally we upload the videos to <a href="http://www.filefront.com" class="postlink">http://www.filefront.com</a>, and then WT downloads it and uploads it to the site.<br>
Dunno if you can directly get it in here, you will have to wait for WT to answer you :p</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">k, cheers for your help, it's currently uploading to filefront (which i had overlooked^^) and should be done in abt 3 hours! lol<br>
<br>
I did try to compress using holy's guide but I was having various probs, but in the end just recompressed using the default settings of the xvid codec which did shave nearly 2gig off the size. <br>
<br>
it's 8mins30 long, n I initially captured at 1280 X 720 but I THINK (excuse my ignorance) Vegas re-rendered the uncompressed avi from virtualdub at 800 X 600. <br>
<br>
I'm a total video noob tbh. I can handle the editing ok but wen it comes to comprehending compression setting specifics I'm lost. <br>
<br>
I made the entire underscore myself tho :]</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If vegas re-redered to another resolution, my guess is it won't look really good. Maybe I'm wrong D:</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

n no, imo I think its perfectly clear, obviously it's no 'Yes-Way', It wudnt offer sum crystal clear footage on a 40inch widescreen or wateva Holy claims, but it's no fraps'd n movie maker'd job ^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
You can judge a video on compression if the compression is so bad it makes the video unwatchable. Onti is just saying that if vegas did resize the vid it probably would make a mess of it, so if it still looks good, it likely didn't.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

n Holy, if I can adress a couple of points (n i know it's not good to try n counter argue criticism but it's gotta be said^)<br>
<br>
you're scoring system seems rather blunt and factual for something that will inevitably be personal opinion. <br>
<br>
Firstly, concept...how can you say that its nice to see a vid that fills a niche then give it's concept 6/10 ? surely to consider the concept you wouldnt be taking into account how it is delivered, just the idea in itself, so you either liked the idea or you didnt! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
graphics...I'll agree with you on that one, the res was never going to measure up to some of the vids on here and I wanted keep effects etc relatively restrained n didnt try anything that fancy, so yeh 6 is about rite.<br>
<br>
music...you can never give a score for music on killvids man, seriously, it is by far the most personal aspect of any vid. I would mark the music on your vid 3/10 like i'd mark most killvids music 3/10 because frankly I hate the music people use in general (apart from Cyn^ that soundtrack was great!) because it's far too weak and washy for what I (emphasis on the I) think should accompany a montage of killing.<br>
I've shown my video to a few people who are into drum n bass and dub-step (dnt kno if you hav that in the states ^) and they loved the soundtrack n said they'd happily listen to it on a CD! But ofc it's down to personal taste so if DnB gives you a headache then, yes you're rite 3/10 prolly fits for <strong class="text-strong">you</strong>.<br>
<br>
and as far as lasting appeal goes....well if you're gonna want to sit n listen to 8mins of music you cant stand then I doubt you'll be re-watching :]<br>
<br>
Thanks for the crtique but dont make it sound so final as if everyone is gonna think that!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Holy's got a point in that, yeh the game's 3-4 years old now &amp; it wud've been nice if sum1 had gave a toss enuf to make a trailer for hl2dm back in the beginning [ certainly wud've made Tal's job a whole lot easier ;] ] but they didnt so mehh. but as the community always seems to hold a level amount of new players to players leaving ratio, spread around enough the video cud atleast giv a bit more of an insight to ppl that would otherwise, play the game, get pwnd n just quti coz its not as easy to master as quake or unreal ^.<br>
This IS a trailer NOT a killvid. and as such its more for summarizing the diversity of the gameplay than just chuckin in a shitload of pr0 fraggidge w/ screen shaking &amp; starwipes mish-mashed in all over the place to detract from what actuly occurs on ur screen during gameplay, and i think that point has to be stressed and considered before ppl watch it and start the bitchin about the lack of innovative artwork &amp; transitions. [there'l be plenty of time for that kind of stuf in further, more suited projects].<br>
In closing, i dont think it's not too much to ask that when u choose to watch the vid u approach it more from the eyes of a budding hopeful than sum1 that has prolly played the game from day1 and already knows that the crossbow can bounce bolts off flat surfaces and that the grav gun can enhance ur other weapons if u perfect the technique.<br>

thanks for all the comments thus far.<br>

n yes as jym sed, I shud hav tried to stress that wen ne1 watches the vid to imagine its with fresh eyes to a game you've never seen before (though that would be damn hard if you're like me n hav played the game on average abt every other day since you got it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

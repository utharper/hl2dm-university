	<div class="content">This is our first go at a team video.  We look like scrubs in many of the scenes, but that was definately intended; we play to have fun, and although that does encompass winning, it also includes losing terribly, too.  Editing was done by Cross, and Screenpeaker, although he's in the credits, is never actually shown.<br>
<br>
Any questions about the scenes, or anything like that, let me know.  There is a better version of this somewhere, and I'll add it when I have it; it's only on Cross's computer right now, that I know of.<br>

	<div class="content">Nice! Would be great to see the full version. Putting the training portion in was a unique and interesting idea. Hope you guys stick around both in CAL and the game in general, I look forward to fragging with you sometime.<br>

I really hope we keep playing as well; this is Cross's and my senior year in High School, and we're splitting up, so it'd be nice to keep in touch.  Fenix is already elsewhere, and I'd hate to leave SP.  Not only that, but there's a ton of great people in the community!<br>
<br>
As soon as it's finished uploading, I've got a high-quality version downloadable.  Still haven't gotten the revised one from Cross.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Here are the ones that I thought of.<br>
Ode to hl2dm<br>
Art of War<br>
Finality<br>
Game Over<br>
Unwonted<br>
Conflict's Video<br>
<br>
There are other good ones, but I find that these have unique value.<br>
<br>
Ode to hl2dm captures (at least in me) those little quirks that make hl2 a great game. It's like a hl2dm dream, a good dream that makes you happy and sad at the same time.  <br>
<br>
Art of War simply has the best editing, period. The frags aren't the best, but they're tasteful and especially impressive looking for new players (not meant to be an insult, it's just that new players can't appreciate certain frags). The music is also great. <br>
<br>
Finality is already up there, but it's good because it's of the community. It's like a video "of the players, by the players, for the players."<br>
<br>
Game Over is also already up there. My personal opinion, but I think that this is the best video of this game. It has a kill from every weapon, and clearly demonstrates advanced techniques. If I was going to show a new player the potential in this game, I would show them this video. <br>
<br>
Unwonted is on there, and it's also great because it shows the potential for greatness in the game, especially with grenade jumping. I would think that this video would catch the eyes of quake and unreal players because of all the in-air action. <br>
<br>
Finally, conflicts video. I consider it the most underrated hl2dm movie. It has everything required of a good frag video, except that the quality is somewhat lacking. But what compensates for the quality is the music selection. I tried experimenting with nonconventional music in my videos, but with no success. Conflict's vid takes a different approach to the music, and it turned out perfect. I can't explain it, so I won't try to. It is legend. <br>
<br>
<br>
So yeah, those are my choices for a hall of fame.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">They have recently been adding hl2dm vids since the beginning of summer, I think it began with unwonted by onty.<br>
<br>
The source radio community is vocal about wanting to see more hl2 frag videos, so far the category is ruled by machinima movis created by litfuse productions, they do some sweet things with source and they prefer hl2 as a base over all, they still use it to date.<br>
<br>
Although the source radio admins come to expect some pretty flashy effects in their approved movies that most of ours don't quite have, the epic display of the frags is what's getting hl2 videos approved, the game is getting a lot more notice from sourceradio though I'm glad blas brought this up, I've been thinking about it also.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">for a vid to be added to moive vault it should not be wmv file the quality has to be pretty good so avi should be a must format. Second the editing does not have flashy but it should be clear that editing has been applied of where frags go so putting frags together in a random order in a frag vid the more unlikely it would be put in. Also no fraps.<br>
 <br>
Please only request vids to be added that deserve to show what this game is about last thing we would want is people requesting poor vids to be added you be wasting the admins time and will make them not want to look at another hl2dm vid because of it. <br>

Finality (x264 encoded) by {HE} holymoly-noway<br>
Master Vik - The Movie <br>
I have already request these vids to be added two of them have already been uploaded. Other three are coming but don't expect them soon because the best damn movie comp period is going on there until September and they trying to get as many people to see them so they can vote. ( I voted korean up rising complete eye candy and great editing it short but has allot of energy carried thro it) <br>
<br>
edit: wish hl2dm vid could compete in it would be great to create a vid and enter it into a comp.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The reality is that it looks very dated now because of all the cool videos that have been released since. At the time of release, Art of War was the gold standard for HL2DM frag videos. I still enjoy it though, as it documents my early play in the game. Notice I am wearing the GoTg tag in some of the frags. I had barely learned to bhop at that point.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

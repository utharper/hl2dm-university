Ultimate_jumps_r1 highlights of the way I'm trying to get to do the map. No stopping for adjustments, just jump and jump again.<br>
<br>
Note: in all these parts, only #7 was made at first try, #8 shows the most further I could get so far, and in 12 I always have to stop cuz I get to the higher platform with too much speed to jump again. Still haven't been able to do it.<br>

That's your problem, not his... try changing your default mp4 player to VLC instead of QT.<br>
<br>
Right click the video &gt; Open with &gt; Choose Program &gt; Select VLC player and check the "always use the selected program..." box &gt; Click OK</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

yea but when you make vid and distribute it (upload it) its best to consider these things not everyone would know this so its best to make it a avi which far more friendly and familar and you don't have guys messaging you I can't open it. It does not take much effort to change it anyway just change name ending from mp4 to avi. More likely people would want to watch it in wmp or vlc so its best to change it . As a vid maker you want to consider your audience and make it easy as possible to watch even when it a plain simple thing.<br>

	<div class="content">I get Nero poping up to see the videos on mp4. I prefer wmp, but you can, as an alternative, make "open as..." and choose wmp. There's other ways too, I believe you know, but for the common user it may not be so good.<br>
<br>
But I can change the file extension next time.<br>
<br>
And don't worry, when in scrims I tend to look at the enemmy and forget the ground and I may even fail the jumps cuz I'm not so worried about it.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Maybe with that I could stop compressing in Xvid and make those that can't playback mp4s to just change the format ;o</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

sadly no because .avi ,mp4 are just containers for the information so if you encode with x264 then users with a slow processor will still have trouble playing it back since there is still allot of information to process (content does not change). you will still have to do xvid for lower users but in truth i would just tell them to watch the flash video on sourceradio since quality will be good as or better which they can view. Just that avi is a container most are familiar with.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

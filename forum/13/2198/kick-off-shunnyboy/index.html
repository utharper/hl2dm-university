	<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">shunnyboy in Kick Off | Codec: Xvid | Length: 87 Mins Approx</strong><br>
<strong class="text-strong">All parts uploaded (You need all 10 parts to extract the video)</strong><br>
<img src="http://www.shunnyboy.com/assets/content/kick_off_dvd.png" class="postimage" alt="Image"><br>
This video consists of frags in Half-Life 2 Deathmatch over the past 3 months<br>
<br>
Footage from public deathmatch, team deathmatch, 1v1s, 2v2s, 3v3s, 4v4s  <br>
clan matches, draft nights, 1v2s, 1v3s, 1v4s in Australian, North American, <br>
South American and European Servers.<br>
<br>
The video took about 4 months straight to record and edit. People may wonder<br>
why I chose to make it so long - I had so much footage that I deemed worthy  <br>
so I decided to release it all as one whole clip, although I may release a<br>
highlight video of all the best shots plus more later. Additionally some<br>
may question my editing style, however I wanted it to be fasted paced without<br>
any real effects that altered the frags themselves.<br>
<br>
Don't pass judgement untill you have seen it! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone featured in my video, cause playing was lots of fun.<br>
<br>
Have fun and I hope you enjoy it! Please comment!<br>

Can't wait to see it but 87mins is too much for a frag vid im sure it will be good but there is a good reason why most frag vids are below 16mins long other than a long up load time. let me do my maths if its like finality as in size and quality then 11mins of 400mb times 8 will be around 3.2 Gb</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

haha, this is the best quote for the past month!<br>
<br>
Shunny, you might need to create a .torrent of the frag film. I don't think you can upload anything above 1gb to Filefront. But then again Shaun might be able to use webspace from the web company he works for.<br>
<br>
Either way, hurry up <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">tbh I will not download it don't really have a day to give away for one download but i will only download it if i hear it is good. But on the other hand u could up load it to Vreel when they get there beta up they are upgrading to 5gb up load for one video which is pretty sweet u can get it close to HD quality and will be able to stream it quick problem is u need to codex it right for the player and i dnk how to do that. <br>
<br>
But listen to the guys advice whole point of a frag vid is to entertain I nerver seen a frag vid that even comes close to 87mins and so i get the feeling it going to get repeative and start to get boring past the 20th min. I suggest u get someone to look thro it to tell u what frags to get rid and so start the project from scratch unless u don't have the raw footage left not too sure yet have not got to the editing and finalizing a project my self. But consider it last thing u want to do is had to spend all that time on it to have everyone hate it because its too long. I have 200 frags that i consider good but barely half of them i will use in the frag vid because by looking at them I see I already got a kill like that some where else and so i pick the frag looks more interesting and appealing and get rid of the other. These are things that you should do when putting a vid like this together because it will end up being really long and a pain in the arse. No pun intended.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yeah really the only good thing i can see doing is downloading it &amp; watching like 10-15 mins of it per day for a week.  I couldn't even take 87 minutes of footage that are as good as sw's or onty's.  Plus, your ping is like 150-200 every time you play with good people....I don't really know how you can think so many frags are that good when most of them are going to be so visually laggy...but w/e i guess i'll dl it anyway for shits 'n giggles.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>
<br>
What you need to do after this if you haven't deleted the raw footage yet is cut everything away from it until you have 15 minutes of the very best of your kills for all the people who won't dl for a multitude of reasons.  Add in some editing, maybe change the sound track (that's something I'm wondering about....wtf am i gonna listen to for 87 mins?) and make a nice normal vid that can be enjoyed in one sitting.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I spoke to Shunny today on MSN. I told him surely he could've cut it down from 87 minutes to at least an hour. But he assured me that there was nothing he could remove. He said there are heaps of xbow bounce blind shots after I told him it's best to have a video full of amazings, opposed to repeated "goods", and I cited Game Over as a good example, but he responded as if his footage/video was in a league of its own, better than Game Over.<br>
<br>
It should be interesting to watch the full video, and see how it compares to other frag videos (game over) which he "ROFL"'d at when I mentioned them in comparison to his.<br>
<br>
If it were me though, I would split it up into 6 or so frag videos.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, he also said the video quality was good. I think it is split up into 6 800mb .rars.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Glad u liked the bounces D: I love them and rpg curves. As far as map/song diversity I strived to do that esp. becasue of the length so that it wouldnt be boring. I put a good deal off effort into music sync so im glad you noticed <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>
<br>
Not sure what song of the top of my head with the bass, but yeah some are pretty hardstyle.. imho 80% is pretty rape (with 0% padding) - i watched back every frag vid on hl2dmu just to make sure the frags were as good or better (again imho). as far as cockiness wise, i suppose there is a little of that in there (mainly some of the aliases ive had <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink">), but considering the length and the fact that i sometimes have a bit of an attitude i thought i kept it to a minimal proportinately to the length of the vid. As far as bounce repatition - i left quite alot out that i had (esp. pub ones), and bio is my fav level so wht can you expect <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> most ppl only have a few so i wanted to give a bit of an idea of just how many i get - my best is 7 bounces in bio in 20min lvl :O<br>
<br>
Songs - yeah liked those ones from game over thats y i used them, and thought what the hell i have similar shots so why not be cheeky and do it like that - well spotted ^^ (i also felt it fair to give luke a heads up as he made g.o. so i let him know also) but i figured it was fine to do as that was that was done in finality - i.e. copied of a css vid.<br>
bonk, yeah i use it sometimes cos i think its a good saying <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>
<br>
overall the reason y i did one so long is:<br>
a) to make something different<br>
b) because many many ppl want to watch frag vids but have little idea how much work it is (why alot of ppl dont make them) and so i thought well if i do one that long then ppl can watch qualtiy footage that is 10 videos long without having to wait for 10 ppl to make a vid<br>
<br>
hope that makes sense. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

First up, Shunny, people aren't going to respect you if you use aliases like so:<br>
&lt;god:shuns bestokayer='true' /&gt;<br>
----below this line : noobs----<br>
best player ever<br>
<br>
Tiger Woods may be the best golfer, but he doesn't go around chanting "i'm the best" and "fuckin amateurs".<br>
<br>
And as far as I know, a lot of people don't respect you in the US scene because of this.<br>
<br>
I thought the 40 foot stun stick comment was halarious: [VDuS] Bio: 40 foot long stunstick.<br>

The video was 87 minutes already, and it didn't help putting in this sort of stuff...<br>
For starters the video contains copyrighted music as it is, and I assume you didn't pay the artist any royalties or anything like that, therefore if anybody is going to be criminally prosecuted, it will be you, not people mirroring the frag video <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
Anyway, you don't spell unauthorised, UNAUNAUTHORIZED... And it's with a s for us Shunny, we don't live in America...<br>
<br>
Now to go the good shit.<br>
<br>
This video was fairly insane. Remove the thousand boring and repetitive random pub aim arena mag shots then shotty frags and this video is as good as Game Over.<br>
<br>
The xbow bounces are totally sick. I think I showed you that one on overwatch from the green car to the xbow room. It's totally sick that you got the frag. It has the flu!<br>
<br>
I noticed you did indeed repeat some exact same frags more than once. In one case I think you repeated it maybe four times (definately three times). You could've cut those out, because there is no point having the same frag twice, from the same camera angle etc, especially considering the video was too long to start with.<br>
<br>
I wasn't the biggest fan of the music, but it was fine. Disturbed = good, but I have heard it in a number of hl2dm videos before.<br>
<br>
Really great video, but there were areas were frags which you could've easily left out. Then on the flip side, there were heaps of frags which had the flu.<br>
<br>

You should make a 15 minute movie though, of just the xbow bounce shots.<br>
<br>
I know all of those Bio ones look similar, but i'm talking about another clip, which was definately duplicated. It was on lockdown and it was FFA, you were outside down on the ground right outside the mega charger rooms windows (so basically where the two wooden boxes fall after they spawn), and you killed a few people and went forward (in the direction of the AR2 side of the map), and you were holding a metal heater which you killed some people with, and after you threw it and killed somebody it bounced off the wall and hit you, and your screen went red. I saw that a least twice.<br>
<br>
And there was a frag on Bio which I saw 3 times, but that wasn't a xbow bounce.<br>
<br>
And another one of Bio, the insane one where you were at the charger, and you bounced it off the curcle wall near you, and it did a whole U turn and killed somebody in the little room filled with water. I definately saw that one twice.<br>
<br>
It's definately worth watching.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I was smoking me own home grown or something, there were no duplicated kills... But I swear I did see them <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Im not sure the ones you mean that are dups. I have watched the vid about 15 times and havent spotted them so im not sure. If there are in there tho then sorry my bad. As for the last frag, that is not in there twice 100% certain. If you are refering to when frags rewind and replay then yes otehr than that i dunno.<br>
@conflict<br>
Thats just a difference in opion i guess, cos imo showing volume is far better than just once as that means you only were good enough to get it once rather than good enough to do often. Otherwise u get bad players getting a fluke shot and appearing better than they are. Thats just my view of it.<br>
Glad ppl liked some of it at least but I guess there was no real point of slaving for almost 5 months for this kind of response - i.e most ppl not thinking much of it or just thinkin: meh</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I can tell you now it doesn't even seem like 87 mins once you start watching. If you still don't like it shunny isn't forcing you to watch the whole vid in one go. Anyways, music was good, frags were good, video was great, xbow ricochets were bs  - highly recommended to any hl2dm fan.<br>

lol, I was.<br>

Shunny, I watched the whole thing again in fast forward, and I didn't find the dup kills I was talking about. Really, really freaky...<br>
<br>
Because for like at least 5 different clips there was major deja vu. Very strange.<br>
<br>
"I can tell you now it doesn't even seem like 87 mins once you start watching." - I disagree. Some parts of it felt dragged out, particulary parts with excess amounts of aim arena footage. Then when you get to the xbow bounces (think the overwatch one, and the aim arena one which bounces off the roof), it gets speccez again.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Alright so I'm still downloading right now but from what I've read about repetitive shots that look the same just an idea would be to sync those shots with the music. As in Game Over, I can't remember who but there was two headshots right in a row when the Disturbed song was playing, with those xbow shots, at first you show the first one that's long and you see all the bounces with it, then instead of showing the bounces again you show the last bounce and it hitting the person and snyc that with the song and so on and so forth for each repetitive shot, but do it all in one go I think. It'd just make it seem a bit better imo.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks alot lad for the great comments <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
@pincus<br>
Thanks for saying that there were duplicate frags before confirming in fact there wasnt<br>
<br>
@ holymoly<br>
"But its also likely that out of the 300+ clips needed for this video, one was accidentally added twice."<br>
Actually there is over 1200 clips used... so to have it perfect is quite hard.<br>
<br>
@everyone<br>
I will be probably making a 15 or so minute one of my favourite footage from that plus a few bits of new footage I have just got. hope ppl can like that more.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I spent a shit load of time syncing, but mainly the slowest thing was recording the frags from hl2dm which i probly put about 500hrs+ into over 3 months<br>

I will do a highlights one tho so ppl can appreciate the very best i have &amp; we can see how that goes. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My review:<br>
creativity 4<br>
content 6<br>
editing 7<br>
soundtrack 5<br>
quality 9<br>
<br>
K well i did not have a pleasent time with this vid mainly due to waiting 6 hours then loss my connection and have to download it again all 10 downloads. This really has effect on how people see the movie so U where at a lost from the start and would of had to given something really special for the time invested by the viewer. <br>
First impression was k some animated graphics. First lot of tracks was not all great but i started to get into the vid. 20mins latter is a complete different story I started to get annoyed see the same shot and then seeing so pubers getting crowbared. There where some good kills but most where average or a shot i see too many times in one frag vid. There was some sync but all together in relation to length it was realy just 100s of frags clips put together with no specific style or anything with the rare black and white. There was some really good kills in there tho but they lost wow factor in the ocean of average frags. <br>
Now sound track yea there was some good ones in there but did not felt they where used to they could of been to create a atmosphere or tension. But the tracks we know so well from game over to be used was a big no no even if u tho it was chicky and ask for permission. Guys that make css frag vids and have a well knock track from a highly rated css frag vid get there balls crushed in a vice and so u loss points for using it especially using the first one and shotting the same as game over. 3min credits at this point you really think should i been using up more memory for this.<br>
<br>
There is allot to talk about in a 1hr and 25mins frag clip but lets just rap this up now. Conclusion is that this was bound to fail for being this long. You should of been more selective with your clips and really thought throw on how you wanted show your self off to the community. Like using alias when your making a frag vid you got to keep in mind that the viewer can see that name too when u kill and having poor names makes you loss creds with the viewer. Also repeating shot I was like plaese somthing else i see that all ready i counted 38 crossbow kills in bow from the same wall shot you used it so much the goodness of the shot died. Around 30% is repeated shoots 30% is average 20% is good 20% is really good, if You where more selective tou could of made a really good frag vid with that footage in 40% alone where u could save that time from recording frags to spending it on planning the movie out and work creativity into it. <br>
<br>
A good short film with average kills that is well edited with originality will be better than 83mins of endless fraging and that's the painful truth sry to say.<br>
<br>
Just being honest and hopefully you will learn from that when u make a highlight version.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Remember that this is the Dept of Film here at the U, we are all about making better and better videos, hence criticism is to be expected in this specific forum.

	<div class="content">Yeah, points taken.<br>
<br>
Still i failed to see how the frags are considered average/boring as the only sort of frags i included were mid airs of all weapon types, rpg curves, xbow bounces/richochets, kill streaks, spawn rapes, pistol/melee kills in 1v1s/2v2s (almost 0% pub to clarify) and also ones where i get multiple shots to kill someone. these type of frags are _exactly_ what is in other videos which have been called great, so when  made the chioce to make it so long i figured putting these frags but 10 times as much would be considered good, not 'repatitive'. I mean I dont think its good because their my frags - I would have thought it was great if anyone else had made a vid of those type of frags that long, personlly i think most vids are far to short. I guess thats gust personall opinion.<br>
<br>
I belive the main problem is ppl have pretty bad attention span as i can easily sit and watch and hour of frag videos, whether it be 10 frag videos from other ppl or one really long one.<br>
<br>
I included credits because it was so long that that I figured I wanted to make it like a movie which has a little bit of that at the end. Ultimately by ppl's responses it would have made no difference either way if i had or had not.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
I liked : <br>
<br>
-Some creative frags<br>
-You used pink ;D<br>
-The fact you used so many maps and didn't make it linear <br>
-Some music<br>
Wait, I don't remember now .. Erm ... <br>
-Sometimes the sound sync<br>
I can't remember what I liked too sorry &gt;&lt;'<br>
-Some nice rpg curve and blind 'nade<br>
-Like all thses suicide<br>
-The .png file<br>
<br>
I didn't like :<br>
<br>
-Music, sometimes it didn't stick at all with HL2DM (imo)<br>
-All these aim_arena/lunatic_arena frags .. I found them so boring.. Sorry -.-<br>
-You used nearly 80 clip making the same ricochet on bio... 1 is good, 2 is ok, 3 becomes boring..<br>
-Some clip had bad/not good quality<br>
-Aliases you used ... You're not a pro.. You're not earning money by playing HL2DM and you're not the best too.<br>
-Smooth effects were ... erm .. laggy, not smooth .. And sound wasn't sync.<br>
-Crowbar show .. I'm not a big fan of this, 1 or 2 is enough.<br>
-It was really really repetitive.. And youy didn't help this when you show 10 times the same 'nade shot on aim_arena<br>
-Pub frags .. Why ? Imo, it ruins a frag movie. Why ? Random players playing on it and not at their best at all imo. Some noobs, some afk. And when you play on a server, in deathmatch, full of low, it's really easy to make all your tricks.<br>
-Song used in Game Over but I know you didn't make it intentionnaly (I think) and I nearly had the same problem when I saw the last 911 movie, I was like "WTF ? Oo_ I wanted to use these songs but, that's cool I had other ideas ;D"<br>
-You forgot tu put sv_voiceenable 0 and hud_saytext 0 or something like that<br>
-Outro was a bit sad<br>
-Not enough cool effects used. You have some nice software, use them.<br>
-Crashed my computer and nearly burnt my Graphic Card Oo_<br>
<br>
I won't speak about the size or the lenght..<br>
<br>
hmm, that's my point of view, I konw how hard it is to make a video but I think you made some mistakes you'll correct in the future.<br>
Good luck! <br>

	<div class="content">I liked it. 87 minutes is maybe a bit too long though, because you see the same type of kill more than a few times, which takes away from the awesomeness of the kill and makes you zone out. However, people are always going to remember "that 87 minute hl2dm frag video", lol.. I loved the variety of maps used in the video, and a lot of these had unique kills on them which was cool. The quality and resolution of the video was excellent and there was some good photoshop skills shown off, as well as a few cinematic editing techniques and recams. The gameover parodies made me laugh, n1.. some kills really were impressive too, good job. Playing with high ping can be tough and it showed in the video. I loved how the innovations from past frag videos are used and developed further by players and shown in new frag videos, because that will help people reach a higher level of skill and continue to push the limits on this game. The voice chat from some of the victims was funny, lol. I didn't like all the aliases though... Some of them made you look really cocky, which i don't think is the point of a frag video. However, on the whole, the video was pretty good, but a shorter vid would get a much bigger response from everyone <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

There were some really amazing frags there, mid air rpgs, mid air nades, ricochets (and pretty creative ones too!), and so on.<br>
However, I have to agree with the fact that ... watching like 20 times the same frag was too monotonous and boring (like the bio ricochet), and there was a lot of footage that could have been left out, like the pistol/melee sequences, the respawn frags, all the repeated stuff against different players, etc.<br>
Music wasn't my taste with exceptions of some songs, and as mentioned already, try not to use that kind of aliases... doens't leave you in a very nice position =/<br>
I do believe a highlight of this video (10 minutes?) well edited would have been great! Try being more picky next time <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

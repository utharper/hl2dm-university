	<div class="content">After having my tutorials or movement videos having a not so good quality, and seeing my frag video on HQ being way better than them and pretty decent for YouTube, I started wondering what were the right settings to upload to you tube...<br>
So far I've done the following tests:<br>
640x480 , x264, 10000 bitrate (max) ----&gt; crappy<br>
1280x1024, x264, 6000 bitrate ----&gt; crappy  <strong class="text-strong">*check Edit*</strong><br>
720x480, x264, 3000 bitrate, 90fps -----&gt; almost like my vid<br>
720x480, Xvid, 4000 bitrate, 90 fps -----&gt; almost like my vid<br>
<br>
Being the 2 last ones really similar and hard to tell the difference.<br>
<br>
I believe widescreen resolutions work way better with you tube (my frag vid is also widescreen), and it might be even more important than the bitrate you use....<br>
I think there is no need to go over 30 fps... that's enough.<br>
Some videos look ridiculously good on you tube, but that's because people had found ways to avoid the youtube compressor (now fixed).<br>
Anyway...anybody else that has any idea on how to get ideal quality? (specially on the HQ versions of youtube)<br>
<br>
Edit: When I added  &amp;fmt=18 at the end of the link video looked really good D; The problem is that you can't see the "watch in high quality" option, but you could use anotattions to lead people to the HQ! <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">. 800x600 might be a good res.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I used XVID and the clips being 30sec long were about 50-100mb so were decent quality but ended out looking like complete crap. I have not uploaded any vids for ages.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well... once I read something like "if you want good quality, upload the best quality you have to you tube"<br>
That's what I'm doing.<br>
Like ...if you do a frag video, compress 3 times our avi.... once in x264 for people to download, another one with xvid for people to download too, and a third time with a high bitrate (10000 if you can) using x264, and upload that one to youtube. That's what I did with my TF2 scout jumping video.<br>
There shouldn't be much trouble for all you that have fast internet connections (come on I upload at 10 kb/s ... <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">i downloaded it very fast, and i watched it..it has a very good quality.<br>
<br>
for me:<br>
<br>
Pros:<br>
<br>
1- the video quality<br>
2- the effects<br>
3- a few good frags<br>
4- i liked the music, but i listened that songs a lot in many frag vids.<br>
<br>
cons (constructive critics <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz">)<br>
<br>
2 - the syncing, its good for a first try, but i think u could did it better.<br>
3 - some useless frag parts. i mean..asi onty said on my video, the best thing u can do is put the Frag itself isntead wasting a lot of video part with unnecesary footage, unless if was a frag sequence.<br>
4 - repetitive transitions. i know u was testing them, but...well u know lol<br>
5 - try to use the Onty's hud remover, and hide all the other stuff and u'll have a clean hud showing only the death notices.<br>
6 - the missing textures<br>
7 - the custom textures, yeah i know they can look awesome or whatever, but personally i like the default ones.<br>
<br>
btw it was a good video frag, very funny...i think everyday the hl2dm frag videos are growing up. Kepp em' coming.<br>

	<div class="content">I sry a little late on my review just reformated and have not installed program to download the torrent which was a pain in the arse since i wanted to look at the the frag video from the first day so lets get down to it.<br>
<br>
k first with the good.<br>
quality is good really good<br>
some nice frags <br>
u tryied to syn the footage<br>
your tried at editing with after effects notice u did the tuturial on the flying glowing line in a box<br>
I like the custom textures <br>
<br>
K now with the bad<br>
<br>
first track is from a well known css frag video that was done by a really good producer. This is bad thing to do many new guys that make there first frag video make this mistake and just makes them look bad.<br>
<br>
Then track from art of war sorry but this is unforgivable its a big tabo to use music that has been used in other frag video it shows lack of creativity on your part and also ruins our assosation with the frag video like cyn which is very well done. My rule is don't use a track that has been used before unless you can do it better in this case you did not.<br>
Try and avoid putting in footage where you miss the guy 3 or 4 times.  <br>
<br>
there was times in the frag video where it cuts to some random footage this distrurb the flow of the video.<br>
<br>
Creativity: 5/10<br>
Content: 6/10<br>
Editing: 6/10<br>
Soundtrack: 4/10<br>
Quality: 10/10<br>
<br>
I know im a bit harsh but I really want to get the point across go find your own tracks and make them your own rather than hijacking somone elses. But overall not a bad attempt work on the editing and keep in mind what i said.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">You don't need did to pick music that people know or like. You got to look around at frag videos and see what music works.<br>
<br>
From what I have picked up, usually good rock and industrial rock works very good since some tracks have very good tempo and varies the speed. Look for tracks with punch lines which works well for frag shots. What I do is look at a range of frag videos pick tracks I like and then search other tracks that the artist has made you might somthing very good that someone has not used. <br>
<br>
ohh and also you don't need to use the whole music clip I see allot of people doing this which is fine but keep in mind you can also use just bits of it. like I have a 6-8min track I really don't want to use it all so i pick a part of it i really like that i think suits what i want to create a example would be the trailer I made. So try and think out side the the norm and inject your personality and style and creatvity anyone can put a bits of footage together but it takes that special somthing that makes it stay in your viewer mind that makes it all worth the days of hard work. <br>
<br>
Plus using tracks your audience does not know is even better than tracks they do know since its like watching a movie for the first time with tracks u have heard before you can tell what coming around the corner so to speak so it lack the special suprise. But yea if you find a track u really like use it but remember you got to keep in mind two things one can I work with it there are tracks that you like but are just unworkable for a frag video and second please do you homework and avoid making u look bad when the track you used has allready been used in a well know frag video especialy art of war which most of us hold dearly as one of the best hl2dm frag videos ever made ( Yet  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil"> ) you using the track from that was like pissing on somones grave.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

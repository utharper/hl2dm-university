	<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>In-Game Synching: When transitioning to another shot after a kill, always transition to a clip where the same gun is out as was in the previous clip. This gives the transition a more natural feel. Also sync by activity, like if a clip ends as a player is climbing up a ladder, a new clip should start with someone climbing up a ladder.
</div></blockquote>
I had thought about his one too. you can't do it all the time, cuz sooner or later there is gonna be another weapon, but sync'ing with the same weapon or doing the sam action is really good.<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Music: Instead of making my own mix for the video, I was going to release it to the community and let them play whatever music they wanted to in the background, or make their own mix for it. It obviously won't be synched up with the action in-game, but at least they would like the ambiance better, right? It's a trade-off.</div></blockquote>
I don't second this =/. As you said, everything will just be out of sync. If you really want your own music, either do the video yourself, or just mute the sound &gt;.&lt;<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Font Scheme: Adobe Garamond. It's classy and clean-cut, unlike most of the font schemes in hl2dm videos so far. For example, both the community vid and my own vid, as well as onti's, dark soul's, and palinoia, used an eroded font. Let's get classy, gentlemen!</div></blockquote>
should check it out. Maybe a modern type of font could work too if well used<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Transitions: Try more wipes and less fade-ins and fade-outs.</div></blockquote>
not bad.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
that way the community can make videos with different authors and new to people new to frag video making.<br>
<br>
That was the idea behind <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/UniversityFrag" class="postlink">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/UniversityFrag</a> <br>

you mean like a common one every video would be using?<br>
<br>
@ scretch ..not a bad song, just a bit too long. If used just a part it could be good, but I see it more like a song for another type of video, something like tflow's goodbye to cyn. I'm planning to do something like that, wanna concentrate on syncing and editing. But as I said, it isn't bad and it could def fit on a bunny hopping scene.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">@ stretch. Furious angels is a good one. There was a very good quake 4 video that used that song. I was thinking that Paper Planes ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sei-eEjy4g" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sei-eEjy4g</a> ) would be a good song for a 'feel good' portion of a video, capitalizing on the sound effects in the song.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'm pretty old skewl on the music.  But here are three songs I think could be used in some kind of frag video:<br>

AC/DC - Girls Got Rhythm  (use with female models)<br>

Guns n Roses - Welcome To The Jungle<br>
<br>
Led Zeppelin - The Battle of Evermore (probably too mellow, but I like the mood it sets)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">I'll try when I have time doing a short project maybe, using something apart from rock/metal.<br>
Cuz I've seen good frag videos with other kind of music like techno, orchestal or other unusual stuff.<br>
I want to do this since, as I've never editing with that kind of stuff, I want to see how well I can syncronize everything and stuff.<br>
A lot of quake, warsow, or other game videos have done great jobs with that kind of songs.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

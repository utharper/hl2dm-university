	<div class="content">Hi, hope I'm not pissing anyone off by asking noob questions but I've googled and even read the n-year-old video guide with missing links and images bla bla and can't get this to work properly.<br>
It's not the first time I recorded stuff and put it together with VirtualDub and so far I didn't have any issues - framerate wise, atm not interested in quality and editing, I just want proper frames. I'd just record a demo, play it and record the movie then idk what magic tutorial on youtube I followed but worked like a charm! I'd open the first tga, change audio and video to full processing, select Audio from other file.., change video-&gt;framerate to 30 ( I think that's what I did last time) and it would just WORK!<br>
Now I twist and turn it, play with different framerates and nothing.. I get a slow choppy vid with a choppy sound. If I remove the sound, it's still a crappy vid. I tried host_framerate 30 in console and made no difference.<br>
I then tried to decimate the frames, by 3 or by 5 (by 2 was still crap) and finally it was at normal/slightly higher speed and sound was good except, of course, it skips some frames so now the flow is gone like I'm lagging in game.<br>
Help?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Seems like you got the basic settings close enough for a final product that's not choppy and stuttering.<br>
<br>
The question is are you rendering 1280 x 720 for HD?<br>
<br>
If so then your PC is going to need a lot of power to play a raw HD video, if it doesn't have that power it will freeze and stutter like you said.<br>
<br>
Open sony vegas and try watching your raw HD video through the preview using low draft settings, if it's smooth you know you need more power. You can still edit and render your clips but you will have to review everything through vegas previews.<br>
<br>
Another test you can try is render the raw footage into any select codec (xvid, wmv, mp4) and see if it plays smoothly. Again if so your PC can't process raw HD fast enough.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">It's most likely because it's raw footage. It will come out smooth once you render it. If you're using Sony Vegas, put the clip on the timeline, highlight it, and press Shift + B (or CTRL + B, can't remember) which will prerender it and you will see it smoothly on the preview.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

EDIT: I noticed I can see the proper vid after I convert the avi to mpeg but.. I don't want to do this eeeverytime I want to check an avi output <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":|" title="Neutral"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

What you're describing is textbook lack of performance, be it hardware or software something is not right.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Don't let VDUB steer you wrong, you can screw up the settings pretty bad and still get smooth results, I don't think you caused this problem.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

You don't realize I use gaming to keep my rowdy ass off the street, all the people I see bragging about getting wasted and being tough fighting people makes me smirk.<br>
<br>
 The fact that you announce that you want to fight is all the proof I need that it's foreign to you, people like you used to stop and watch people like me beat the breaks off of habitual line steppers, you are a nervous spectator,  By all means come whoop my ass.  Get mad at phantom I assure you he gives 1/4 of a fuck, he also thinks it's stupid to let a pretender like you paste this site with your bullshit.<br>

Lets summarize:<br>

Zeik: I'm pretty pro gamer<br>
<br>
Us: No you cheat and are terrible still<br>
<br>
Zeik: Oh I pro hack coder none stop me<br>
<br>
Us: You're getting them from another person and we have proof<br>
<br>
Zeik: Oh well than I pro troll I troll you and claim to be anonymous on an account with a username <br>
<br>
Us: No you're awful at trolling<br>
<br>

Actualy, it is fixable, but the problem isnt the programs or w.e, Ade is lol, i mean he does not want to install vegas or even record on 1280x720. I guess i can't help him unless he installs vegas and do all the other things.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

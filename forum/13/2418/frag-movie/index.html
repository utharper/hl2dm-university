Wouldn't you want to show off the best of best in a way to get people intrested? and each .tga file it creates is 2mb, and it creates 60 every second, that's why.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The 100 GB number is either the uncompressed video or the losslessly compressed video (Huffyuv, Lagarith, etc).  Modern lossy video codecs do a rather phenomenal job of converting these massive uncompressed files into something manageable while maintaining decent quality.<br>
<br>
DVDs use MPEG-2 compression.  DivX or XviD use MPEG-4 ASP (advanced simple profile), a newer standard over MPEG-2.  X264 is based on H.264 which is MPEG-4 AVC (Advanced Video Coding) which is newer still.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Wrong, the 100 GB Number is the tens of thousands of TGA files (Lossless Image Files) that it creates. He'll still have to take those .tgas and import them into vdub and compile, which will be around 400 megs or more depending on quality.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Actually neither of us are wrong.<br>
<br>
I assume that he is wanting to create a DVD (like DVD-Video) of the demo.<br>
<br>
You are correct in that he will convert the demo to TGA files.  These could easily be 100 GB of TGA files so you are correct.<br>
<br>
My assumption though is that he will take those 100 GB of TGA files, run them through vdub to create an <strong class="text-strong">uncompressed</strong> avi.  This uncompressed avi will also be nearly 100 GB (a little more cause it will also have the wav audio in it) which is what I was referring to.<br>
<br>
I would always suggest the first conversion out of vdub from the TGAs should be uncompressed.  It gives you many more options.  If you compress it right away and then later need to recompress it (say from ASP to AVC) you start losing quality quickly.<br>
<br>
From there he will take the uncompressed avi and then use something (whether it be Premiere, Vegas, or any number of other cheaper tools) to author a DVD (MPEG-2 stored in VOBs).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

no man cuz it would take me alot of time for editing and stuff like that.. and its just to show the gamplay <br>
<br>
oh and i understand it would give me 100 gb of tga files but after converting it like buckycatt explaind to divx or mpeg than it would still be 100 gb?? cant i convert just like a dvd movie like 1 and a half our of film and it would be 4 gb ?? cuz a movie is also 4 gb am i right ??<br>
<br>
and buckycat a question wich program should i use for converting ?? maybe you got some links for me ??</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Like Edge said do this in console:<br>
<br>
host_framerate 30; startmovie namehere; playdemo filename<br>
<br>
This will create a bunch of TGA files and a wav file in your hl2dm folder.<br>
<br>
Now use <a href="http://www.virtualdub.org/download.html" class="postlink">VirtualDub</a> to open the first TGA.  This will actually open the entire series of TGA files.  Under the Video menu set Frame Rate to 30 fps.  Under the Audio menu select Audio From Other File and find the wav file that was create in your hl2dm folder and change the mode to full Processing Mode.  Now go to File and select Save As AVI.<br>
<br>
Basically you are following step 4 in this guide:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=917" class="postlink">http://www.hl2dm-university.com/forum/p ... f=13&amp;t=917</a><br>
<br>
From here if you are wanting free tools to assemble the DVD you could try the following this guide:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/avi_to_dvd_avi2dvd.cfm" class="postlink">http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive ... vi2dvd.cfm</a><br>
<br>
It makes use of <a href="http://www.trustfm.net/divx/SoftwareAvi2Dvd.php" class="postlink">AVI2DVD</a> which is free.<br>
<br>
You could also just author the dvd in something like Premiere (Elements) or any one of the Sony Vegas products.  All you would really be doing is dropping the avi on the timeline and then selecting Render to DVD.<br>
<br>
That will get you a VIEDO_TS folder that you can then burn onto the DVD using anything like Nero or Roxio or whatever.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

If those 13 minutes are uncompressed video at 1280x720 then yes... easily 60 GB.  Now, once you run it through XviD or x.264 then it will be more like 300-500 MB.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

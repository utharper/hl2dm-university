Edit: Some nice xbow shots, keep up the good work <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
My advice:<br>
-Remove the brackets when recording.<br>
-Avoid using so many slo' mo' , some of the shots would have seemed better without it, and it gets kinda tiring after a while =/<br>
<br>
How did you record? Using fraps?<br>
Because I could tell you didn't record a demo.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
+ Nice to make an xbow vid, great weapon and always fun to watch<br>
+ Clarity was good considering the size of the video and the file<br>
<br>
- Many of the xbow shots were dead on shots, meaning you fired directly<br>
at an opponent. The beauty of xbow is the prediction, such as an opponent flying through the air sideways and you time the shot perfectly. Super long distance shots are also nice, or banking the bolt off a wall. I guess I am just saying hold out for the more insane shots because otherwise you are just showing what we see any time we play.<br>
- Sound codec on DL version failed for me and I got no sound. Not sure if this is my issue or you used an unusal codec?<br>
- No need to show you getting blown up by RPG, we have all seen that 10000 times by playing (unless you are making vid for non-players).<br>
<br>
Let us know how you made the vid and maybe we can guide you towards slightly better methods. Example: Download "Yes Way" by Holy Moly to see just what is possible. Not saying you gotta put that much time into your vid, but it might give you some ideas to work on.<br>
<br>
Thanks for contributing, hope you keep at it. <br>

	<div class="content">I am working on converting the FIOS demos. I had trouble because I could only import 10000 frames of footage into VirtualDub.<br>
<br>
I posted on the vdub forums and the maker of the program informed me that HL2 might be exporting frames that are not in sequence after 10000 frames. <br>
<br>
This proved to be the case. With host framerate 30 it exports frames starting at 300000. When it reaches 309999 and flips over, it doesnt go to 310000 like you would expect it to. Instead it adds another position and goes to 3010000. This causes vdub to think the sequence is over, so it ends the import there.<br>
<br>
I was planning on removing the extra postion from the later frames, but then I realized that no matter how long your movies are, the first 10000 frames are always consistent, so it is more efficient to add the extra position to the first 10000 frames.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows of a good tool to batch rename, please let me know. <br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

Batch File Renamer 2.51<br>
<br>
A simple little app. Just grab the first 10000 frames, move em to a folder, then<br>
fire up this little program and use the "Catalog Files". Set the starting number to 3000000. This will renumber the first 10000 TGA files back into sequence.<br>
<br>
I converted a FIOS match as a test. It was good quality, but 600 MB in size for 15 minutes of footage. At that size I would like it to resemble the Cyn movie in terms of video clarity, or maintain the current quality and drop the size to 400 MB maximum. <br>
<br>
So I am off to learn more about xvid settings....advice appreciated!<br>

	<div class="content">Ok, so I looked at all the other xvid encoded movies out there. All of them get the slight distortion around the crosshairs and the text. Now I know why the Cyn vid looks so clean, they removed the crosshairs altogether, swtiched off chat and replaced the HUD with one added during the edit.<br>
<br>
The best compromise I can come up with is to leave the original HUD, but make sure chat is switched off and use a single dot for crosshairs (or the smallest crosshairs possible). When watching the video most of the attention will naturally be drawn to the crosshairs, so you want as little distortion there as possible.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I've found If you go from a resolution such as 1280x1024 (what I use) and keep the same crosshair (assuming you have a single dot modified from the original file) as you change video size to 640x480 (what xvid has best compression/quality at) the dot is friggin huge.  <br>
<br>
To compensate, remove (to safe folder)  your halflife2.ttf file and let the game generate a default 5 dot crosshair, then edit the 4 dots out leaving the center dot.   This creates the correct size for 640x480 xhair single dot and not some enormous balloon for a dot.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I should be posting the first FIOS export soon for feedback. I have been testing settings, I just havent done the final render.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

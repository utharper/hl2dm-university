                      Half-Life 2 Moviemaking Guide by {HE} holymoly-noway<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Picking a soundtrack:<br>
<br>
Try to not use songs already featured in Half-Life 2 Videos. I suggest watching a lot of CS:S, <br>
DODS, Quake 3&amp;4 Videos. Learn how they put frags to the beat and use songs that aren't by<br>
Drowning Pool. I suggest adding in a slow song to offer some variety. In the end, just put<br>
in songs that you like. You'll have to listen to them for a long time while you're editing, so<br>
make sure they're not your very favorite songs. By the end you'll be tired of hearing them.<br>
<br>
Frags:<br>
<br>
Sequences are good. Also, don't recam very much. Too much recamming slows things down and ruins<br>
the flow of the video. If you want a great video tutorial on Demo Smoothing and recamming, check out<br>
the forums at <a href="http://www.infprod.de" class="postlink">http://www.infprod.de</a> . They have a lot of links there and they're very, very talented<br>
CS:S movie makers.<br>
<br>
Custom Resolutions: <br>
<br>
You may choose a custom resolution which is not listed in the in-game resolution options.<br>
You can actually run the game at any resolution you want as long as it is in a window and not<br>
fullscreen. Do this by right-clicking on your desktop HL2DM shortcut icon and adding this to the<br>
command line:<br>
<br>
-windowed -w xxxx -h xxx<br>
<br>
example: -windowed -w 1280 -h 720<br>
<br>
Visual Quality:<br>
<br>
In your video card's desktop control panel, make sure you force the maximum resolution settings.<br>
Even if Half Life 2 Deathmatch does not support your settings from the in-game video menu, you will<br>
be able to improve visuals from outside the game by telling your video card to force maximum<br>
anti-aliasing etc. <br>
<br>
Use anX's Movie Config. The config contains extrememly useful settings which will let you record<br>
up to 26 different TGA series without having to specify new names. You click the same key (F11)<br>
and it will cycle to the next sequence name every time you press it. Also, you'll find hitting<br>
1, 2, and 6 to be very useful in toggling the HUD, gun, and crosshair on and off. There's also a<br>
shortcut key to remove the spectator bars which detract from the visual quality of the video. <br>
<br>
I cannot stress enough the importance of rendering at the same resolution you record in. Every time<br>
you compress images (either resizing or compressing) you lose data. The lost data obviously results<br>
in a lower visual quality. If you're going to try and use the X264/h264 codec in the ecoding process<br>
you need to make sure that your in-game resolution is divisible by 16 in both the width and height. <br>
X264 is the best codec available freely, but is a CPU power hog. It also needs a good deal of free<br>
hard drive space to buffer itself adequately and prevent stuttering and/or freezing. <br>
<br>
Xvid is the other option to consider. It beats DivX's ass and takes a dump on Windows Media v.whatev<br>
anX's webpage provides links to his encoding tools which are invaluable. His settings should not be <br>
your settings, however. You will need to experiment with small clips and find what settings get you <br>
the best file size vs. quality ratio. I found that bitrates over 5000 and a quantizer of 1 work well<br>
and still keep sizes relatively small. Also, the deblocking numbers in X264 help make images sharper<br>
the smaller they get. Negative is better than positive. Please also note that videos of 1280x720 <br>
resolution work best with default AVS script cropping numbers. Custom resolutions may require <br>
different cropping numbers. There are sites available to help you figure that out. <br>

<br>
You are not the shit.<br>

Please also know that you can contact me at any time as long as you're active in the Half Life 2<br>
community. I will not provide assistance to people who want to post videos on YouTube, Google,<br>
or other low-quality websites. If you want to post on the web like that, just use Windows<br>
Movie Maker with default settings. Better yet, use a free copy of fraps and make sure the <br>
<a href="http://www.fraps.com" class="postlink">http://www.fraps.com</a> watermark is at the top middle of your video the entire time.<br>

	<div class="content">I do plan to convert all the ones in the pack eventually. Only problem was that I ran out of HDD space recently and you need quite a few GB to export a 15 minute match and compile it (try it sometime).<br>
<br>
Soooo many things going on it is hard to do everything, but I will see if I can get back to converting them soon. One hold up was that I was trying to do an onscreen score for the rest, but for some reason when I pulled the raw footage into my editor it was locking up on me.<br>
<br>
Hopefully I can get a few more done soon, feel free to bug me about it sometime.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

My lsd movie was 80 gb ( the rendered file on one side, and all the clips on the other, so it hogged 160 gb of my HDD). Wouldn't like to think about 15 minutes ! XD</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'll see if I get them to work first. And you'd have to know that FiOS was what got me started again after a 10 month break. I wasn't even using nade cooking back then, lol</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, finally I could get the video uploaded.<br>
I think I did a good job in general, taking into account this was my first time doing a frag vid :O<br>
I would only have liked to do a bit better intro, but meh. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Length: 10:48<br>
Size: 412mb<br>
Resolution: 1280x768<br>
Codec: x264<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll copy paste the readme ;D<br>
<br>
Clan {LsD}* is proud to present their first Frag video.<br>
All the footage shown is from the Cyberathlete Amateur League seasons 1, 2, and 3. So not a single shot was staged <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
=LSD=  --&gt; 1st season  \<br>
=LsD=  --&gt; 2nd season   &gt; In case you were wondering =P<br>
{LsD}* --&gt; 3rd season  /<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
We apologize for the fact that some parts might seems jerky or some shots weird (like the rpg moving late, and magnum shots that aren't aimed properly.)<br>
This is due to us being from South America, and playing the league with pings from 180 to 230 or some times even more =/ <br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The movie was produced by myself <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> (Cristian Ontivero| aka onty.).<br>
However, clanmates really helped (they gave me their demos with the tickrates of each frag)<br>
Also, dark soul made the custom hud, and s0iz helped me with the music selection.  Thanks guys &lt;3 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Speacial thanks to:<br>
LukeGT421<br>
Nate<br>
Punk.<br>
<br>
* For lending us their servers for the matches in the different seasons. Otherwise we couldn't have played, thank you !<br>
<br>
Holy-moly <br>
<br>
* For creating the pack with the guide and everything on how to make a good frag video.<br>
<br>
We would also like to thank every single person in the video, because the matches were freaking good ! :]<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Note that if you are in this video is because.<br>
1) We played against you in CAL<br>
2) A frag against most players in the video is concidered "relevant" (at least for us), because lots of the players fragged are great and respected ones.<br>
   This is why we showed the death notices. We didn't want to make a video against random new and "unnamed" players.<br>
3) Some players are shown more than others, because we have played more matches or rounds against some teams.  <br>
<br>
In NO WAY, this video intended to humillate someone or prove we are better than anybody. Some of the matches shown were won, others were lost, and the video shows just frag highlights.<br>
<br>
I hope you can all enjoy it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
*****Additional thanks to Briggs for uploading it <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> thx man ! &lt;3<br>

Well, I tried to get the best of what we had, and a lot of nice combos or stuff where all fucked up because of the lag and being wrongly recorded (like some s0iz shots in which he seems like freaking missing and killing the person).<br>
I'll make sure to get AWESOME stuff independently of who was killed in my personal video ;D<br>
Lucky for you, I still have the uncompressed avi, so I can compress it to xvid....<br>
I don't know how though... but surely reading here and there will get the job done =P</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

also liked how you removed the hud but were able to keep the kill/death indicator, was waiting for someone to try this.<br>

frags weren't amazing, but there were some really sweet kills in the movie , i personally like those rockets..<br>

Well, I do have at footage to make an at least 6 mins vid with only good frags.<br>
But that's cuz I love them so much I try them all the time.<br>
Sure, I miss a lot, but some few get me the kills, and after months of those "few" frags, u end up with a lot of footage.<br>
I sent holy moly lot of stuff, but not my best cuz it's sv_pure 2 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>

	<div class="content">Very nice, some of those RPG frags made me shit my pants, esp that one on zeta that gets shot out the roof, and comes down right on a players head in the mag alley / scharger exit.<br>
<br>
now im sad i havent gotten the chance to play you guys on the 2v2, we made it to playoffs last season but went inactive due to the amount of forfiet wins we were recieving and interest in other games..<br>
<br>
modus and i are going to be making a demo of our 2v2s, not just from CAL, but i hope to achieve something as great as this, great editing, good choice in music and awesome frags.<br>
<br>
i'd also like to note i enjoyed watching fearsome get pwned several times, doesn't matter how "good" the frag was when its against someone with that large of an ego.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

@blas---&gt; s0iz doesn't play CAL anymore, since season one... so he footage is really old, and his shots aren't the most "impressive" ones.

	<div class="content">Wow wow wow... thanks to all of you guys, for those who liked it and those who didn't like it, too <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
I think it's a very good video, the music synced well and the frags were pretty good.<br>
<br>
As Onty said, I don't tolerate to play with high-latency anymore, I find it annoying and not fun at all (I always play for fun, I like competitions aswell but I don't like to get mad/nervus or whatever when playing).<br>
<br>
I think Onty and Dark Soul are doing a great job at CAL, I am currently a bit retired because I'm busy with my studies and training. No worries; I'm not leaving, just standing by.<br>
<br>
Conclusion, is good to know that you liked this video, although my frags are pretty old and "lazy" (yeah, slow, like a begineer).<br>
<br>
Thanks again for everybody. Especially WT, DEFme and Holy-Moly for hosting.<br>
<br>
My EuroTrip has ended and I am back at home again.<br>
<br>
Good luck and keep playing.<br>
<br>
PS: Pretty good improvement in this site!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

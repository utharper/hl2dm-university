	<div class="content">We've been offering ventrilo channels for <span style="text-decoration:underline">free</span> to <span style="text-decoration:underline">whoever</span> wants one, not many people have taken us up on the offer. <br>
<br>
Soooo to kill 2 birds with 1 stone, this is a demo of brian and lostcause getting white knuckle raped by poorbilly and myself, alltalk was off but that doesnt stop people from watching the sourcetv demo later and lawling at all your cry baby accusations and half assed excuses you supply your team mate.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.redlight-gaming.net/demos/briancryin.rar" class="postlink">http://www.redlight-gaming.net/demos/briancryin.rar</a><br>
<br>
some nice frags in this one, but i suggest you first free spectate and fly out of the map with your voice receiving volume up and lawl at brian.<br>
<br>
If you'd like a vent channel, pm me or ninojman or just log on, and ask modus, nino or myself and we'll set it up for you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

thats fine, don't attempt to prove it and when someone asks me "is brian better then you?" i'll say "lawl, look at these screenshots, or no here, watch these demos and watch me rape him first hand AND enjoy the sound of him crying." because calling everyone better then you a hack, or saying "i dont have crosshairs", or "he sucks so bad he's doing good" aren't excuses if you cry about them hard enough.<br>
<br>
i know you're stupid but how are you going to call me out for excuses in response to a thread with a 20 minute demo of your own excuses for getting raped? like look at these other responses... are you serious? once im done with this map i'll put some effort into the game again and you can come into thedistrict anytime, like you always could've and try and prove you can own me in a world other than the one where grape actually gets to have sex with ema and in which you still suffer from premature ejaculation bum looker.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, some of the frags were cool, a few of the ricochets made me smile. The music didn't really fit well with the video you had though. Pub footage wasn't super entertaining, and you have a few kills in there that were just meh, and a long section without much action that you should have tried to speed up or dropped it all together. Quality was pretty good, although laggy on my laptop, but thats to be expected on this machine. I guess the rpg jumps on aim were cool, but its been done before and with frags while in air and such. Also it looked like it was composed of maybe 10 demos? Not that its a bad thing but you can't really get amazing shots / frags with just 10 demos usually, well at least not enough to make a frag video =p.<br>
<br>
Next time try to pick songs that will really fit well with your footage or that you can make your footage sync better too.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Nice vid !<br>
<br>
Things I have appreciated :<br>
<br>
- Nice intro, indeed <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
- Good rythm, it's important<br>
- Some very nice frags (crossbow bouces, etc...)<br>
- Music was ok for me, and even very good for the intro.<br>
- Size / lenght<br>
<br>
Things that could be improved :<br>
<br>
- Strange to see the credits at the beginning ^^ (but it's not really a problem)<br>
- Some frags could have been removed (some shotgun kill on aim)<br>
- The render looks a bit blurry, dunno why. And I think the render was in the "interleave" mode and not in "progressive". Hence a loss of quality too (1 very thin black line every 2 lines of render)<br>
- Tired to see that "movie vault" bullshit <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
- You should remove the chat when it's useless with hud_saytexttime 0 (or something similar, I dont remember the correct spelling)<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall :<br>
<br>
Really good frag vid for me, if you have the time one day to start a second one and dont forget our advices you should be able to reach a really good level of editing, that's the reason of our feedbacks after all <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">My 2 cents:<br>
Hats off for the rpg frags, I'd keep those and xbow ones and leave it at that.. You're good with predictive weapons, but the mag and shotty are weak and it shows. Also, you sometimes have a whole arsenal of weapons against someone who just spawned and has no time for gathering and fails to kill you with a nade - that should be a quick kill for you, but it's far from it. Movement is meh. As for editing, the intro is just too good for what comes next, it's a sort of anticlimax? Like others said, syncs nonexistent, in-game editing makes you look undecided or experimenting (which isn't a bad thing, hope you learned stuff and we'll see a next vid <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> ) and I might add, you just mix up frags from demos, sometimes going back to a certain demo. Try a bit of categorizing like in other vids, by map and/or by no of players (1v1, 2v2)<br>
<br>
OFF: weird name for a thread lol I guess we can all start one named 'my vid'</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">A long time in the making, I give you my humble offering of a frag video.<br>
I've been working hard and long to get it completed before the $W release and the standards rise out of my reach <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
What to expect:<br>
decent frags<br>
pretty good quality<br>
good music variety (with some obscenities [if anyone cares])<br>
a tiny bit of editing, nothing fantastic<br>
<br>
What not to expect:<br>
exploded brains<br>
<br>
Length: 12:01<br>
Size: 394 MB<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that I only get to play for about five weeks out of the year due to college firewalls so I've been saving up these little bits and pieces for awhile. They're not mondo-impressive, but they're the best I could get and should be entertaining at the least. <br>
<br>
Special thanks to Holy Moly for advice on video quality. ^_^<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy!<br>
<a href="http://files.filefront.com/palinoia+xvidavi/;9676815;/fileinfo.html" class="postlink">http://files.filefront.com/palinoia+xvi ... einfo.html</a><br>
<br>
Note: I didn't zip the file because apparently it's impossible to shave more than 2 mb off the file in winrar and winzip. If anybody would care to tell me the secret or zip it themselves and put up a mirror I'd be much obliged. ^_^</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Watched it last night, very nice work Poco.<br>
<br>
+ Quality good...not quite Holy-Moly level, but high res and very watchable.<br>
+ Solid frags given the time you have to play<br>
+ Well edited for the most part. 1 or 2 spots that coulda used some work, but certainly nothing major.<br>
<br>
- Soundtrack. Not really a criticism, this is just personal preference of course. I would have liked to have seen some faster, higher energy tracks to generate more "excitement". I found these songs to be quite laid back. The prodigy song was probably the one I liked least, it just sounded too sparse for a frag video imo.<br>
<br>
On a play style note, you appear to suffer from many of the issues I have been having lately. You appear to get jitter and lag quite often. At times you shoot behind the player model, like what you are seeing on screen is not what is actually happening.<br>
<br>
What kind of rig and connection are you playing on? To me it looks like it is holding you back by messing up your hitscan and movement every so often.<br>
<br>
EDIT... <br>

	<div class="content">Thanks for the comments, Def. I realize that the editing was a little lacking, especially when compared to the cyn video. But as tempting as it was to go balls-to-the-wall on this, I have to keep reminding myself that I'm in college and if I spent my free time on the weekends working on this it would be at least two or three years before I put together anything of value. I guess I just don't have the patience required to work on something that long. Besides, I found that the longer I delayed the higher the standards got. I hope you find the lack of editing forgivable, since my grades were inversely proportional to the amount of time I spent on this video.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Good to know !
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>Besides, I found that the longer I delayed the higher the standards got.</div></blockquote>
True.....I hope that my frags are considered at least good after releasing my vid o.o<br>
<br>
kk, feedback time !<br>
As Def said, there wasn't much editing or syncing, but at least you have good reasons for that so it's ok, np ;D<br>
Frags were good, and you had some really nice shots or combos.<br>
I still don't know how you got the bolt to go through the rails in lockdown, it always gets stuck for me. 3:23-27 is like, "ok, easy boys, split". I love when people are having a hard time to get a frag and you come and end their suffering quickly and easily ^^.<br>
You also showed some really nice reflexes against orbs and some nice mag skills. Very good taking into account you can't play much during the year <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
Keep up the good work.<br>

Don't think you should have to worry too much about that haha. <br>

Ummm, google? lol. I don't remember the exact site, but I remember googling 'free fonts' or something like that.

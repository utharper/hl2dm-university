	<div class="content">There could be many "movement" trick things for the vid:<br>
- Very long jumps in popular maps or long jumps executed perfectly in the thick of battle. Unlike ptrain 15, which noobs do not know, making long jumps in maps that many people know may surprise and entertain some.<br>
- Jump pads, of course. Very bouncy, very strategic, and very fun. Also enhanced by SMG nade to go extraordinary heights to reach special areas, such as king_air's RPG platform.<br>
- "Speed ramp" jumps. I haven't seen this in any map other than king_air, mag_surf, and ctf_connectors, but circle jumping or doing some kind of movement before getting launched can hurl you GREAT distances.<br>
- SMG/Nade/RPG jump -&gt; kills are always neat.<br>
- Transversing through terrain with grav gun jumps is always neat, especially in live/unstaged matches.<br>
- Speed pipes, which I've really only seen in my own map ctf_revolution. Those things can send you launching. Teleporting from speed pipes into speed pipes allows for some pretty insane bunny hopping, going over 1100 velocity and literally zooming in way too fast for any defense or SLAMs to stop you as you go for the flag.<br>
- Speed lines, as seen in king_air and ctf_revolution. These things give at least +100 velocity for every bounce you make on them and can allow for some insane travelling or long jumps.<br>
- Trimps, simple but can reach some tall heights.<br>
- Lockdown jumps, meh. Everyone's seen them already.<br>
- Too bad that swot's clan vid intro jumping got nerfed or is hard to duplicate on a typical server.<br>
<br>
I guarantee you guys that king_air will allow for some neat and insane aerial combat and travelling, hopefully in a similar manner to the old-school Quake maps (I've never played them, but have seen some footage of their outer-space maps). Jump pads, speed lines, ctf_dirtwork-style walls to allow for bhop roaming on roofs, a very fast speed ramp, numerous routes, and other things you wouldn't normally imagine to be possible in HL2DM.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

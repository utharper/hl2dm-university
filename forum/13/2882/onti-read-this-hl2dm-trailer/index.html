	<div class="content">Ok so I was thinking, there's no trailer for this game, no visibility, the game is free and people don't even know it.<br>
<br>
We should make a MIND BLOWING hl2dm trailer, in wich we show the awesomeness of this game?<br>
<br>
so Onti, your toughts on this, get the best frags off the people out there, use almighty editing skills along with the holy after effect and prepare to smg nade people's mind??<br>
<br>
Should be clearly shown in the trailer;<br>
<br>
CAL divisions<br>
omgwtfbbq kills<br>
someone nailing a jump map (for movement?)<br>
<br>
And then we can upload this somewhere and link people to it and spread the word<br>
people won't watch clan video because they're all like " bah another clan video " but TRAILERS, idk people love them.<br>

Isn't there a trailer already? I haven't been able to see it cuz when I downloaded it, it was corrupt (surely because I used a dl manager, but my internet sucks so much I won't be able to download it all at once).<br>
I guess I wouldn't mind but, hipothetically, I get into this, sup with the community frag video? would that dissapear?<br>
I'd personally prefer to finish this frag video, which surely if uploaded to sourceradio will get a decent amount of more views, and include the "game for free" stuff in a .txt file<br>
Maybe that way we can boost the number of players.<br>
Apart from that, so far not everyone has sent "Mind blowing frags", which I thought people wouldn't have much problem getting some by now, so unless the top players out there start scriming a bit to gather some amazing footage to promote the game, it will be hard to do so.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I think the closest to what your talking about is somthing like this.<br>

So for it to be a trailer is has to tell you what the game is about like weapons gameplay maps like they do in this example. I belive a cartel player made a so callled trailer or movie and you have it on the main page of the uni site tho it not reflect the speed and enjoyment of the game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">well i guess so since that one was not done by the community so it was everything from his view. I guess it could be good to invole the community in one. But who will do it we need a film maker I know onty has allready started his new project and im still trying to get my first ever one made.<br>
I think onty will be free in 2 months he could do it after he done the community frag movie he know for getting farg movies done quick also keeps him busy.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

i'll take care of the epic jump-shoot-miss-battle, then finally get the kill shot lined up, only to die by the random 28th bounce, crossbow bolt, with its final 6 inches of inertia... hitting me in the heel.   <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/sketchy.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":sketchy:" title="Unsure"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
Imo we should make something like black mesa source trailer, only we overview the different weapons and see them in action without explaining (only music and video) I think that would create a bit of mastery and make things much more interesting by making the viewer want to try for himself. <br>
<br>
Its kinda like when the commercial for an upcoming video is made with all the best parts in the film, ruining the film when they get to that part in the movie if you know what I mean.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

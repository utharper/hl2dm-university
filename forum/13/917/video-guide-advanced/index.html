Move every slider over to the side of Maximum Quality and make sure you max out antialiasing and anisotropic filtering. For me, both max out at 16, but your card may not be able to handle that. Or maybe you have a really sick card that can do 32. Either way, make sure quality is the best you can get it. Screenshots:<br>

Try to look for the optimal bitrate... Like for instance there is nearly no difference between using 7000 and 10000 as bitrate, but the second one will have a bigger size, so there is no point to exceed to much.<br>
Remember to do both x264 and Xvid versions .... for x264 I'd say that ... 5600 - 6000 should work really fine ... haven't tried that resolution so I'm not sure.... try !</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

did a bit of googling and apparently all my renders are maxed at Gb 3.99. Which apprently means im using a FAT32 drive and that i need to render on a NTFS drive for more. Sounds strange to me that that a program like this would have this limitation<br>
I pretty worried about this because all three drives i have are FAT format. <br>
<br>
Which means i have to reformat one or more likely convert it. Not sure if i should do this i could loss Gb 130 of valuable work if anything goes wrong.<br>

<br>
The limitation isn't in a specific program but rather in the design of the file system and the size integer (16, 32, 64 bit) that they use to store information in.<br>
<br>
If you are rendering to uncompressed AVI you may also try rendering to a losslessly compressed AVI (<a href="http://neuron2.net/www.math.berkeley.edu/benrg/huffyuv.html" class="postlink">Huffyuv</a> or <a href="https://lags.leetcode.net/codec.html" class="postlink">Lagarith</a>).  They typically cut the size of the file in half with no loss in quality which may allow your render to sneak in under the 4 GB limit.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Holy is starting a new phase of his life.  One in which people actually due very thorough background checks (including scouring the internet for any little hint of "deviant" behavior).  Consequently he has pretty much removed his entire internet presence including asking WT (through me) to remove all his posts from the U.  I did "sorta" save his guide before that happened.  The images will be gone (since he also deleted his flickr account), but the text remains (though slightly edited).  Hope this helps.<br>
<br>
Video Guide<br>
<br>
This guide presupposes that you have already recorded demo footage of yourself and that your footage is good enough to warrant making a video of it. If you either dont have good footage or dont want a high-quality video, please download Fraps and use that program. You can find a guide on how to use Fraps elsewhere.<br>
<br>
0. A NOTE ON PHILOSOPHY<br>
<br>
There are a lot of videos that give off a very strong I am l33t look at me pwn vibe. Please dont let yours be one of these. You may be l33t. In fact, you may have an aimbot and a wallhack built into your very brain. But please, dont act like youre the best thing since Aunt Jemima and her syrupy goodness. I highly suggest you take a step back and evaluate what you would like to see in a video. I imagine youd like some really nice frags, a good soundtrack, and a bit of humor to liven the mood. Try it. Have a frag of you blowing yourself up on accident. Miss that nade and let us watch it blow you to smithereens. We wont think less of you- we know that you, like the rest of us, die a lot.<br>
<br>
1. BEFORE YOU START<br>
<br>
Open up any folder and go to Tools and then Folder Options. You want to uncheck the box that says Hide Extensions for Known File Types. Heres a screenshot:<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
Also, you should consider recording your video in at least 800x600 resolution. You can do this and still get a good file size. This is why youre reading this tutorial. Heres a hint- you can record at any resolution you want to. All you have to do is add this to your launch options (right click on half life 2 deathmatch in steam):<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
You can input anything you want to for the height and width. Its your call. But if you want to encode in x264, which you should at least try, each dimension needs to be divisible by 16. 1280x720 works great, but 1440x900 does not. 900/16 produces a non-integer quotient (dont work).<br>
<br>
Before you start the dirty work, you also need to make sure that your video card is forcing maximum settings in hl2dm. You can do this by going either to your nVidia Control Panel or your Catalyst Control Panel and unchecking every box that says Let the Application Decide. Move every slider over to the side of Maximum Quality and make sure you max out antialiasing and anisotropic filtering. For me, both max out at 16, but your card may not be able to handle that. Or maybe you have a really sick card that can do 32. Either way, make sure quality is the best you can get it. Screenshots:<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
2. INSTALL PROGRAMS<br>
<br>
To open these files you will need a program which can unzip RAR files. The most common program for this use is one called WinRAR, which you can find by googling for it.<br>
<br>
Download this pack and follow the readme instructions.<br>
<br>
Download this movie config and place it into your hl2dm/cfg folder.<br>
<br>
If you intend to encode using Windows Media Codec v.9, you'll need Windows Media Encoder v.9, which you can download here.<br>
<br>
3. Record<br>
<br>
After executing movie.cfg (type "exec movie.cfg" in console), load up a demo file. You can hit F8 to use demoui to skip ahead to a certain point in the video. When you come to the point where youd like to start recording, hit the left arrow on your keyboard to change your recording rate to 30fps, and then hit F11. When youve recorded what you want, press F12 to stop. An important note: The movie config is set up so 26 recordings can be done on one execute of the config. If you restart the game, reload the config, or record more than 26 videos in one setting, one or more of them will be overwritten. To prevent this, move your footage out of its originating folder after you close the game.<br>
<br>
Tip: To record in slow-motion, hit the down arrow to record at 90fps. Later in VirtualDub, still tell it to process at 30fps, thus slowing down your movie by 3x.<br>
<br>
Once youve hit F12, youll see a series of .TGA screenshots and a .WAV file in your hl2dm folder. Your next step is to assemble these into an .AVI which can be edited in a program such as Adobe Premiere or Sony Vegas (or Windows Movie Maker).<br>
<br>
4. Assemble<br>
<br>
Open Virtual Dub<br>
<br>
- File &gt; Open video file &gt; Click on the first screenshot in your hl2dm folder (the whole series will open up)<br>
- Video &gt; Framerate &gt;Change to 30<br>
- Video &gt; Color depth &gt; Decompression format: 24 bit, output format to compressor/display: 24 bit<br>
- Video &gt; compression &gt; Uncompressed or HuffYUV (lossless codec which you installed, reduces file size but keeps quality intact)<br>
- Video &gt; Full Processing Mode<br>
- Audo &gt; WAV audio &gt; Browse to your wav file in your hl2dm folder<br>
- Audio &gt; Full Processing Mode<br>
- Audio &gt; Compression &gt; Uncompressed<br>
- File &gt; Save as AVI<br>
<br>
5. Edit<br>
<br>
At this stage in the process, you should edit your video to include a soundtrack, transitions, and editing effects which make your video more enjoyable to watch. Instructing you how to edit movies is not directly pertinent to this tutorial, but may I suggest you buy a book (I bought Vegas Basics 6.0 to learn how to use Sonys movie software). This tutorial will assume that youre using one of the two most popular programs- Sony Vegas 7 or Adobe Premiere.<br>
<br>
6. Render<br>
<br>
The rendering process will differ depending on what codec you decide to encode with. If you want to encode using Windows Media Video Codec, youll render as an uncompressed AVI with audio included with the video. If you want to encode with x264 or xvid, youll need to render a separate AVI and WAV file.<br>
<br>
General Rendering Settings:<br>
<br>
You should render in progressive scan (no field order), 1.0 pixel aspect ratio, and whatever resolution you recorded at. Changing resolution invariably scrunches something up and makes your video quality decrease dramatically. Your audio should be in stereo at standard quality. Bumping up the kbps doesnt dramatically increase audio quality but will add to audio file size, which takes away space that should be allocated to video quality.<br>
<br>
Rendering for WMV<br>
<br>
In Sony Vegas, after you're done editing:<br>
<br>
- File &gt; Render As...<br>
<br>
Now in your "Render As" window:<br>
<br>
- Template: Default Template (uncompressed)<br>
- Save as Type: Video for Windows (.avi)<br>
<br>
Then click on the "Custom" button. In your "Custom Template" Window:<br>
<br>
- Project tab &gt; Video Rendering Quality: Preview (this will prevent deinterlacing and you will not lose any quality)<br>
- Hit okay. Name it what you want, and hit save.<br>
<br>
In Adobe Premiere, after youre done editing:<br>
<br>
- File &gt; Export &gt; Movie... &gt; Settings<br>
<br>
Okay now you'll have a window opened called "Export Movie Settings."<br>
<br>
There should be should be four categories on the left: General, Video, Keyframe and Rendering, and Audio. Now do this:<br>
<br>
- General &gt; File Type &gt; Microsoft AVI<br>
- Video &gt; Compressor &gt; Uncompressed<br>
- Video &gt; Frame size &gt; whatever resolution you recorded at<br>
- Audio &gt; Compressor &gt; Uncompressed.<br>
<br>
Rendering for x264 and xvid<br>
<br>
In Sony Vegas, after youre done editing:<br>
<br>
- File &gt; Render As...<br>
<br>
Now in your "Render As" window:<br>
<br>
- Template: Default Template (uncompressed)<br>
- Save as type: Video for Windows (.avi)<br>
<br>
Then click on the "Custom" button. In your "Custom Template" Window:<br>
<br>
- Project Tab &gt; Video Rendering Quality: Preview (this will prevent deinterlacing and you will not lose any quality)<br>
- Audio Tab &gt; Uncheck "Include Audio" box<br>
- Hit okay. Name it what you want, and hit save.<br>
<br>
After that's done, you'll need to produce the uncompressed audio file:<br>
<br>
- File &gt; Render As...<br>
<br>
Now in your "Render As" window:<br>
<br>
- Template: Default Template<br>
- Save as type: Wave (Microsoft .wav)<br>
- Hit okay. Name it the same thing you named your video and hit save.<br>
<br>
In Adobe Premiere, after you're done editing:<br>
<br>
- File &gt; Export &gt; Movie... &gt; Settings<br>
<br>
Okay now you'll have a window opened called "Export Movie Settings."<br>
<br>
There should be should be four categories on the left: General, Video, Keyframe and Rendering, and Audio. Now do this:<br>
<br>
- General &gt; File Type &gt; Microsoft AVI<br>
- General &gt; UNCHECK the "Export Audio" box<br>
- Video &gt; Compressor &gt; Uncompressed<br>
- Video &gt; Frame size &gt; Whatever resolution you recorded at<br>
<br>
After that's done, you'll need to produce the uncompressed audio file:<br>
<br>
File &gt; Export &gt; Audio...<br>
<br>
Name it what you named your video file and hit save.<br>
<br>
7. Encode<br>
<br>
You should now have a very large video file (Yes Way was 80gb before I compressed it to 400mb, so dont be afraid).<br>
<br>
WMV9 Codec<br>
<br>
Pros: Decent file size, good quality at any resolution; very simple encoding process.<br>
<br>
Cons: Troubles with color balance. Edges of reds can be lost; areas of green can be oversaturated.<br>
<br>
- Open up Windows Media Encoder. A new session window will come up. Just hit cancel.<br>
- Hit the properties button near the top.<br>
- Sources Tab &gt; Source From: File<br>
- Sources Tab &gt; File name &gt; browse to your master file that you made in premiere/vegas<br>
- Output Tab &gt; Uncheck the Pull from Encoder Box<br>
- Output Tab &gt; Check the Encode to File box. Hit browse and save it as what you want<br>
- Compression Tab &gt; Destination &gt; File download (computer playback)<br>
- Video Size Tab &gt; Blue resize text &gt; Method: No resizing<br>
- Processing &gt; Pixel Format: YV12<br>
- Hit apply. Then hit the green Start Encoding button near the top....<br>
<br>
NOTE: This encodes @ 5mbps. Quality will be excellent, but you'll be sitting @ about 36-39MB/minute @ 800x600. Expect pretty large file sizes.<br>
<br>
Xvid Codec<br>
<br>
Pros: Low file size, high quality at any resolution, accurate colors all around.<br>
<br>
Cons: Not as good as x264 as far as quality is concerned.<br>
<br>
First, make sure you read the readme in the encoding materials folder you downloaded. Make sure you put the xvid folder into your Documents and Settings/your_user_name section of your C:\ drive.<br>
<br>
Run your DOS command prompt. The default directory should be:<br>
<br>
C:\Documents and Settings\username<br>
<br>
type "cd xvid" and hit enter. Now your directory should be:<br>
<br>
C:\Documents and Settings\username\xvid<br>
<br>
type "lame audiofilename.wav audiofilename.mp3" and hit enter. Your audio file should encode pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
You will now have a file called "audiofilename.mp3" in your C:\Documents and Settings\username\xvid folder. This is your compressed audio.<br>
<br>
Next up is the video compression.<br>
<br>
Right-Click in any white area in your C:\Documents and Settings\username\xvid folder &gt; New &gt; Text Document.<br>
<br>
Rename it to: videofilename.avs<br>
<br>
Windows will ask you if you want to change the file type. Say yes.<br>
<br>
Open up the file (it won't know what program to use. Just do Chose Program from List and use notepad). Put this in the body:<br>
<br>
AVISource("videofilename.avi")<br>
Crop(0,0,-0,-0)<br>
ConvertToYV12()<br>
<br>
Save it and close it.<br>
<br>
Open up VirtualDubMod.exe:<br>
<br>
-File &gt; Open Video File &gt; Browse to your videofilename.avs file.<br>
<br>
-Streams &gt; Steam List &gt; Add &gt; Browse to your audiofilename.mp3 file.<br>
<br>
-Video &gt; Compression &gt; Select Xvid MPEG-4 Codec. Hit Configure.<br>
<br>
In your XviD Configuration Window:<br>
<br>
-Profile @ Level: (unrestricted). Hit the more... button to the right of it.<br>
In the new window, use these settings:<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
Hit okay. Back in your main XviD Configuration Window:<br>
<br>
-Encoding Type: Twopass - 1st pass<br>
<br>
For your Quality Preset, change it from General to "User Defined". Then click the "more..." button to the right of it.<br>
<br>
In new window's Motion tab, use these settings:<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
In the Quantization tab, use these settings:<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
Hit Okay. Okay. Okay.<br>
<br>
Back in your VirtualDubMod Main Window:<br>
<br>
-File &gt; Save As (F7) &gt; CHECK "Don't run this job now; add it to Job Control so I can run it in batch mode." Save it as "firstpass.avi" in your C:\Documents and Settings\username\xvid folder.<br>
<br>
Back in your VirtualDubMod Main Window:<br>
<br>
-Video &gt; Compression &gt; Select Xvid MPEG-4 Codec. Hit Configure.<br>
<br>
In your XviD Configuration Window:<br>
<br>
-Encoding Type: Twopass - 2nd pass<br>
<br>
-Target Bitrate: Bitrates for 800x600 work well around 4000, but youll have to play around to find your perfect balance between quality and file size. You can find xvid bitrate calculators online that will help you.<br>
<br>
Hit okay. Okay.<br>
<br>
Back in your VirtualDubMod Main Window:<br>
<br>
-File &gt; Save As (F7) &gt; CHECK "Don't run this job now; add it to Job Control so I can run it in batch mode." Save it as "secondpass.avi" in your C:\Documents and Settings\username\xvid folder.<br>
<br>
-File &gt; Job Control (F4) &gt; Start<br>
<br>
There will be a firstpass.avi and a secondpass.avi in your C:\Documents and Settings\username\xvid folder. The secondpass.avi is your finalized project.<br>
<br>
x264 Codec<br>
<br>
Take your uncompressed .avi and your uncompressed .wav and put them into your C:/Documents and Settings/*Your Windows User Name*/x264 folder as specified in the readme. Make sure their names are both the same.<br>
<br>
Right-Click in any white area in your C:\Documents and Settings\username\x264 folder &gt; New &gt; Text Document.<br>
<br>
Rename it to: videofilename.avs<br>
<br>
Windows will ask you if you want to change the file type. Say yes.<br>
<br>
Open up the file (it won't know what program to use. Just do Chose Program from List and use notepad). Put this in the body:<br>
<br>
AVISource("videofilename.avi")<br>
Crop(0,0,-0,-0)<br>
ConvertToYV12()<br>
<br>
Save it and close it.<br>
<br>
Audio:<br>
<br>
Go to the command prompt (start-&gt;run-&gt;cmd) and then type "faac -w -b 128 audiofilename.wav"<br>
<br>
Now your audio is done.<br>
<br>
Video:<br>
<br>
Open up megui and update everything. Then it will restart. Next import the AVS file. It will pop up a video window but you can just close that. Next make sure you're encoding with x264 and rendering in mp4 file format so it looks like this:<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
Now hit config next to the video profile box. Here's what your screens should look like.<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
Play around with your bitrate to find what works best for you. This is what will most dramatically affect the quality and file size of the video.<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
Image<br>
<br>
Back in the main window, now hit Enqueue. Go over to the Queue tab, make sure you don't have any papers due in the next 10 hours that you need the computer for, and then hit start.<br>
<br>
After that, you can pretty much leave it alone for a while. You will need to click once, though. It creates identical file names for the second and third passes (basically uses the second pass to create a better third pass and correct mistakes). Because it makes identical file names, it will ask you if you want to overwrite the secondpass. Click yes.<br>
<br>
After its done encoding, you should have your video file in the same folder as your AVS file. Now load up YAMB Muxer and combine the audio and video portions (remember- the file names have to be identical for it to work). And now, at long last, you're done.<br>
<br>

<br>
I just noticed one important thing tho, on both Keefy's and BuckyKatt's posts. Holy used his own website to host the tools and apps needed for encoding and other stuff and they are no longer available. <br>
I noticed I still have them all, except the Windows Encoder, in my HDD, so I uploaded them. I made a link to the MS website for the Win Encoder, I think the program is the same.<br>

I could try and make up images to illustrate the guide, but I'm not the right person to do it since I don't understand the apps that well, and I have almost no experience in movie making.

	<div class="content">ok, im making some fundamental errors that i cant quite figure out.  after executing movie.cfg...<br>
<br>
1. the movie.cfg commands only seem to work when i have the console open.  i assumed it should work while just having the demoui open while reviewing the demo.  so, i have demoui open, then console open, hit f11... close console (only then does startmovie begin)... close demoui.  then i have to open console... hit f12 (stopmovie)... hit f8 (open demoui)... then pause the demo so i can goto my next tick mark.  seems a bit cumbersome if thats how its supposed to work.  but i assume im doing eet wrong.<br>
<br>
2. even with console open, the LEFTARROW seems to do nothing.  i dont get the echo notification... now capturing at...  also the f5 (clear console bring up movie menu) doesnt work.  console tells me it cant open movie menu.<br>
<br>
3. the end result of all my attempts is the sound being out of sync with the action.  sound always finishes before the action.  ive tried various frame rates in vdub... but shouldn't it be 30.000?  which leads me back to the LEFTARROW issue i mentioned.  ie, its not capturing at 30?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Just do something like what I did and...<br>
1. Use DemoUI to get to the tick that you want and pause the demo.<br>
2. Close out DemoUI<br>
3. In console type host_framerate 30<br>
4. In console type bind i "demo_togglepause; startmovie namehere"<br>
5. In console type bind o "endmovie; pausedemo"<br>
6. Hit Esc. and then i to start recording and o to stop.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
No i suggest you to record it to 600fps, then change it to 30fps in virtualdub to create a nice and smooth gameplay and a motion blur effect.</div></blockquote>

That all depends on what effects you want your video to have actually =p</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

<br>
To open these files you will need a program which can unzip RAR files. The most common program for this use is one called WinRAR, which you can find by googling for it.<br>
<br>
Download <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/yunmozjwtzo/guide.rar" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:#0000FF">this pack</span></span></a> and follow the readme instructions.<br>
<br>
Download <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/tzghmlzq2mn/config.rar" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:#0000FF">this movie config</span></span></a> and place it into your hl2dm/cfg folder.<br>
<br>
If you intend to encode using Windows Media Codec v.9, you'll need Windows Media Encoder v.9, which you can download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5691ba02-e496-465a-bba9-b2f1182cdf24&amp;displaylang=en" class="postlink"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:#0000FF">here</span></span></a>.</div></blockquote>

Everything is in there, the guide.rar included xvid tools, Avisynth_257, XviD 1.1.3 and VirtualDub, and the x264 tools, faac and megui 0.2.6, just as holy provided them.<br>
<br>
I could try and make up images to illustrate the guide, but I'm not the right person to do it since I don't understand the apps that well, and I have almost no experience in movie making. I leave that to someone that may feel willing to and confortable with it. That would be a great thing.</div></blockquote></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

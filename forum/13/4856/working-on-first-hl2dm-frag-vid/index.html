	<div class="content">Okay, I'm pretty much retired from HL2DM. I've been playing HL2DM since March of 09 and I've had a blast, but skewl has been hella tough and I just can't try to become pro and do good at skewl and my internship at the same time so I had to give up HL2DM. HL2DM has GOT to be one of the BEST dam multi games I have played. So I'm working on a frag vid that will show off HL2DM and a few of my best frags, and will kinda be a goodbye vid I guess. I'm keeping everything simple, I don't want to have a long 20 min frag vid or nuthing. I'm shooting for 5-10 mins MAX. I was wondering what you guyz who have made more frag vids than I have could critique my work? I'll post a sample here soon.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of my editing software:<br>
<br>
Sony Vegas 9 Pro<br>
CS4 Photoshop<br>
CS4 After Effects<br>
Magic Bullet Looks<br>
Virtual Dub<br>
I've got some other tools, but I didn't feel the need to post them<br>
<br>
I know how to record demos and smooth pretty good so I'm good there. TY Infected Productions/Onty/Ahungrymidget<br>
<br>
I'll post a teaser link here soon. Thanks ahead of time for any help received!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

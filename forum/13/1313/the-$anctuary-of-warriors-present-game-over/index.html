<br>
I want to take the time to thank everyone involved..<br>
<br>
LukeGT421: Thank you for taking what I didn't have the capability nor the patience to finish, and to upload week in and week out the sickest frags I've ever seen. Also, great times on vent over the past year, you mah boy.<br>
<br>
Fearsome*: Thank you for being our old wise man. After dag left us you picked up what slack he left behind and gave our screwy ??? clan a good leg to stand on. Also had a great time with you on vent, AND sickkkk frags!<br>
<br>
The Liberal Conspiracy: Thank you for being patient with us when you wanted to rip our heads off for delaying and not using a few frags. I still think you have a few of the best frags in the vid. Get on ts more fios frand.<br>
<br>
Mario 64 Master: Thank you for always being solid. If we ever needed you for anything it was always given up without hesitation. You and Lib also held this clan together like gold when we were being restarted. Also, some of the frags you uploaded made me drop a load right on the spot. Get in ts ?????.<br>
<br>
.conflict: Thank you for always keeping our spirits up. You're a fun dude to play with and talk to, I was so happy to see that we finally snagged you and found you a good home. Your frags make me lol almost everytime, hahaha.<br>
<br>
Death_Bringer: Thank you for resurrecting yourself and becoming a main player once again. I only wish we coulda snuck you in the video. Also, 2on2's with you are so easy. Nothing goes wrong.<br>
<br>
Holymoly-noway: Thanks for helping with whatever we could scrape out of you. This video wouldn't be what it is without ya.<br>
<br>
Walking Target: Thanks for bringing what diminished community we had back together and giving us a place to let every bit of anything we had bottled up inside on your forums, I am a frequent troller and love letting off some steam in there! It's also the closest thing we have to a HL2DM game guide.<br>
<br>
Dag(ALT168): Thanks for making me the monster I am today. I miss you!!<br>
<br>
Anyway, onto some video details.<br>
<br>
This is a compilation of frags from the past year, give or take. When we set out to make this video, we had one goal in mind: to beat an unbeatable game, to get to the end of a never ending cycle, to WIN this awesome game known as HL2DM. I feel we have done just that and I named the video accordingly. There are a SLEW of maps in the video, it's not all dm_lockdown, well, *cough* lib and mar *cough* MOST of it isn't! These frags were meant to amaze people, not just toot our own horns. We have a multitude of frags that no one has even attempted, let alone seen. This video took us quite a long time to perform and then eventually create. I want to thank EVERYONE for their patience, I know many people never thought this day would come and completely gave up on it. I think it was worth it so ENJOY!!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Thanks man <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

As I have said before, this place probably wouldn't exist if not for Alt encouraging me to do it and providing the original HL2DMU server. I literally almost said "nah fuck it" until I got a PM from him that set it all in motion. $W helped start this thing, and you guys have backed it from day 1.<br>
<br>
I will hold off on vid comments so that everyone gets a good chance to see it first. I wanna watch it a few times anyway, and I can't crank the sound at work. <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Content: 10<br>
Quality: 8<br>
Editing: 8<br>
Sound: 9<br>
<br>
Verdict: Takes the cake on quality of frags. Unbelievable. There are vids that have better editing and quality (cyn, holymoly), but nothing compares to the in-game skill.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>santagauss wrote:</cite>What this video really gives you is motivation. This video will raise the bar for what is expected of frags in a frag video, and play in the servers. The typical mag shot heavy lockdown and lostvillage only videos are now outdated. The best part is it really shows what this game can do and how cool some of the other weapons are. Spam over walls, xbows that bounce 10 times, team work, and mid airs all over. If you are trying to show people what this game is about and why it is so awesome this video is the one to do it with until something better is released. This video also showcases the unique features of other maps and the possibilities are endless, now go out and find those other 50 10 bounce shots in amplitude, jack a guy out of the air with a rocket in avalon and the other 15 ways to attack the inside of zeta. Bring the game to a new level. It's not well finished and it has tons of bugs but not many games have these kinds of possibilities.</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">the most memorable ones were the 2 orb launches on zeta.  That's a great idea and really cool.  I also liked that part where luke jumps on one of his team mates heads on zeta and then jumps onto the outside platform where the 2 rockets are really cool.  <br>
<br>
Other then the last crossbow kill I really liked that crossbow kill that modal does from the back mag to the front mag on lockdown! <br>
<br>
Also haha,  I enjoyed seeing fearsome chucking in grenades into the roof of zeta! and also that 4 nade kill in a row scene on amplitude. <br>
<br>
Probably the funnest kill is when tlc kills fearsome with the computer keyboard.. haha.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing"> <br>
<br>
The video is very fun to watch and has a high replay value i would say.  Probably the only downside is that some of the kills go by so fast that it's hard to even notice that they happened.  <br>

<br>
10/10 for content, best movie released to date. It's gonna make my life harder in matches now that people start thinking outside the box after seeing this.<br>
<br>
9/10 for music, good choices, nice subtle syncing in select places.<br>
<br>
8/10 for editing. Pretty straight forward, not as cinematic as a few other movies, but clean too. Music ended a little abruptly, but no biggie.<br>
<br>
9/10 for quality, res and size. Almost 13.5 mins at 1024 x 768 for 592 MB. Well done. Nice work on the HUD, perfect in that respect...names left in single dot, no other junk and recams clean.<br>

That definitely makes it into the archives, phenomenal job, the quality of the kills and the general in-game skill that was demonstrated kept me in a constant state of 0_o.  I'm glad you guys made it over 10min, the editing was top notch and I really enjoyed all those re-cams.  This is one of those frag videos that you play for motivation before a long gaming session, it just gets you pumped and really shows you how to be creative with your kills.  I find myself suddenly inspired to start practicing air smg nading more.  I really enjoyed the hater section at the end as well, that was a nice touch lol.

I will say that it was a good vid, and that no I could not do a better job. But it had its moments and I thought some stuff in there wasn't "over the top." I really did love Luke's first kill and thought it was one of the best. Overall though, some parts just weren't "spectacular" and I got kind of turned off by the 10,000 people on my friends list IM'ing me about it. <br>

So my conclusion is it was good, but way overhyped by everyone.<br>

4:21 is the first 1 healther, 3rd person sourceTV as explained up dere^ Although Fearsome did have 1 health  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked">  I'm not saying anything is rigged but from the looks of it (I slowed it down, I'm a fanatic <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"> ) there is blood coming out of him when HCC dude shoots him up w/ his SMG, I dunno if he shot Fearsome down to 1, or if it was always one, or if it was that blood decal bug, but as you can see there are more ppl playing in that server, so even if it were rigged (I don't think it was..) it was still not planned.  Not to mention, it's a badass transition <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":P" title="Razz"><br>
<br>
In the whole sequence starting at 9:25, Fearsome is at 1 health, although he doesn't get shot until 9:35, this is hard to detect, and I can't really see if he gets shot or not (his target shot in a diagonal line but skipped him..), since it was at 1 health, and from that distance, I dunno, I'm neutral on this one XD  There's an explosion behind him at the same time, it'd make sense if that was a teamate.<br>

Only if you only see 1 health. Most of the time I was recording if you see a normal HUD in first person, and most shots are a combination of a first person demo and a source TV recam. But you know Valve and the bugs in this game, sometimes even if you record you crash then you don't have time to rejoin and record. Sometimes cause demos are not auto named you lose the name of the demo and can't find it. Other times demos are just corrupt. And finally sometimes I just plain forget to record or don't think I am going to get a good shot. I can say we lost alot of really good kills to bad source tvs and demos too. We had about 50 over the wall rockets in Zeta or lostvillage and the same for over the wall frag grenades, but early on they were personal demos and made for bad replays with people disappearing. Later on we would get this messed up bug in source tv demos where you could not control the free look cam it would just teleport like 5000 units away at random.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

appreciate your opinion, but we really were not trying to compete with other videos... we made this video purely to inspire people to get to that next level of hl2dm...

yeah it's a bug with extracting footage... sometimes there's no animations for shots fired... sometimes there's no audio for shots fired... in fact.. i had to manually put audio into some of the clips because it just didn't export <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":(" title="Sad"><br>

the shots in the demo were great, i cant imagine how many demos ahd to be saved to colelct all of them, the editing wasn't up to par with the art of war, but almost every quick 5 second ownage shot you saw in the sw vid owned any "lets see that in slow mo" shot from the art of war demo.<br>
<br>
so heres my run down<br>
<br>
Frag Shots: 10 (&lt;3 flying arrow of wtf)<br>
Music: 5 (war was a great choice... everything else earned you 1)<br>

<br>
First off, thanks Luke for not being offended by my comments. Very well appreciated. I did enjoy the video I just think that with everyone hyping it up to me, it sort of lost value. I did tell that SW worked hard on it and they are great players so I meant no disrespect. P.S. Luke that first xbow shot was more than insane!!<br>
<br>
Ghost...I'm not saying the whole vid was common frags, obviously it wasn't, I just think here and there were some ok/more common frags. I did absolutely love the nades in zeta, and Modal's 5 or 6 person combine ball. There were plenty of insane frags...just some were kinda eh. The insane xbow kill on the first shot I think set a way high standard and I think maybe it should have been put in later...I dunno maybe? I'm starting to ramble....<br>
<br>
SnipeIT, absolutely I am partially jealous that I cannot pull off frags, and make a vid like that. There is absolute truth in that. I'm going to have to watch the vid again and really make another opinion because I think it was just everyone telling me that I was going to love it, made me like it less.<br>
<br>
<br>
After watching it a second time it seems like some of the kills go by way too fast...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Nice job $w crew,  I know you put a lot into the video and could have went in a bunch of different ways with it.  But overall Imo the most important thing to come is you guys show hl2dm at it's best and shows the fun you can have in-game if you work at it.  As fearsome said i really like the amount of different maps the video has  Which adds to the overall feel.  As i think poco said before somewhere it's also nice to have some of the frags with the footage b4 and after the kill.  Sometimes just having a good 357 hs without anything else can be boring.  But this video is a bit long but it makes up for it by having Fun mixed in with frags.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the video and all your hard work guys.  Oh and fuck tf2 that shit is whack yo!</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

One of the reasons I love Dingle Chronicles, is the attitude MODaL has, that brought an intensity to the video that most lack. Effects are nice, but who needs them when they detract from the frags anyways. This video follows the same pattern.

You mean my kill against kurtz?  That was me hearing a very faint rustle from behind with my expensive Alienware headphones lol... way better than any speaker setup could do.<br>
<br>
The clip actually came out a bit funky... if you look closely you can see that he kinda vaporizes before the ball even reaches the back of the hallway.  It looked fine the first time, but I had to extract it again, and my computer must have lagged a bit or something, oh well.<br>
<br>
Here is the original clip, if you have decent headphones or speakers you can probably hear the little combine jingle: <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ESCX9EOC" class="postlink">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ESCX9EOC</a><br>

You mean my kill against kurtz?  That was me hearing a very faint rustle from behind with my expensive Alienware headphones lol... way better than any speaker setup could do.<br>
<br>
The clip actually came out a bit funky... if you look closely you can see that he kinda vaporizes before the ball even reaches the back of the hallway.  It looked fine the first time, but I had to extract it again, and my computer must have lagged a bit or something, oh well.<br>
<br>
Here is the original clip, if you have decent headphones or speakers you can probably hear the little combine jingle: <a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ESCX9EOC" class="postlink">http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ESCX9EOC</a><br>

Weird, this is probably one of my least favorite frags in the video, it seems pretty unspectacular to me.  I didn't even choose to extract it, tlc was looking through a couple of my demos for some reason and he happened to pick that one.  I only liked leaving it in the video because it sounds really cool synched up with the music.  Why did you like this one so much?  Well, all the better since you like it, anyway.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I'm more into exploration and experimenting diff ways this game can be played, whenever there's people on THE shellshock server, i'll play it over regular pubs.<br>

and that is why those vids are doing extraordinary service...<br>
<br>
A thought. have a few copies of the <strong class="text-strong">same vid</strong> only each copy have a <strong class="text-strong">different title</strong>. like "baits" for all sorts of tastes... .some names don't even need to say its DM.<br>
like: <br>
#1  The $anctuary of Warriors present Game Over<br>
#2  Amazing hl2dm frags<br>
#3  Skills<br>
#4  What DeathMatch is really about<br>
#5  Gaming<br>
<br>
 ....that's the general idea...<br>
and goes without saying...all high level frag vids posted in the U can do the same. the idea is the service they can do for this game and community and im sure the clans will appreciate more exposure.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Had a question about the video. At around 7:40 into the video, I noticed Luke's mag shots on zeta_prefinal didn't  have much of a recoil to them. Is that because you guys sped up the video or was this already answered? I skimmed through the pages but didn't catch it.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

For us some impressive crossbow bounces of lockdown, etc... starts to become common for the HL2 community but could be unbelievable for the ones who dont know the game at all !!<br>

I don't even care if I win, but if this vid inspires someone else to start playing HL2DM, then my mission is complete.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"><br>

In France it's the end of 03.29 right now (11:35PM), and I'm at 90% of the editing.<br>
<br>
So I will finish it, publish it here and as an answer on you tube by the end of tomorrow, so we will be the 03.30.2010 and it will be before the end of the contest <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>
<br>
So much stuff for few seconds of video and for only 1 frag xD<br>
<br>
But like it has already been said it will be to promote the game and it will be in my case a kind of goodbye cuz I rarely play now, after all these years of HL2 <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Except that if you watch carefully and apply some knowledge from DM, the bolt travels at 3000 velocity, slows down and is unaffected by the tunnel speed boost.

<br>
..."and apply some knowledge from DM....."  yes and that was my point, the physics are incorrect.  what's the velocity applied on something from the tunnel boost?  cant be 3000....even it was the bolt would still win because mass travelling in any direction will have opposite force of resistance applied against it, surface area of said mass is the main component in that equation, obviously the player would have more surface area then the bolt resulting in more applied resistance. BUT, i guess there would also be the resistance the bolt was getting from bouncing on the tunnel sides.  but what ever, still a nice kill.  when i play tested this map i actually was intreged with this same concept and tried repeatedly to see if a player could beat object thru, i tried orbs, barrels, etc. seemed the object always won.  (ya, i know BI, that was a super cool story)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Yep Im really disappointed too with the choice of this contest :/<br>
<br>
The air rocket from TF2 is not incredible. It's not a double air rocket really given that the target arrives after the first bounce very close to the shooter (close to the train) so the 2nd shot was way easier to finish him.<br>
<br>
I think Fatality has chosen this frag cuz there are a lot of people on TF2 and it was "Quake like", nothing else. Yes there were a lot of better frags, and given that HL2 is really more complex than this other game and there were some insane frag with crossbow bounces, including jump with objects etc.. I was really expectating a frag from our game to be selected...</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I vouch for him.</div></blockquote>

<br>
Well we also have to take into account those ones with the objects and stuff wouldn't really be impressive to anyone else outside of this community. They'll probably think its some illegal move or something.<br>
<br>
No offense Zeik, we all think the shot was pretty cool.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Seriously if ppl posted stuff other then bow bounces i think there would have been more of a shot, wen i saw the frags ppl were posting for hl2dm i was dissapointed and i actually know the game.<br>
Personally i HATE wen ppl put bow bounces into frag videos, mainly for 2 reasons, 1. Its a chance shot, who cares unless its funny somehow and 2. Its really boring watching a bow in slow mo, or watching someone shoot a bow at a wall, if i were fatal1ty i would have crossed them off at first sight.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">So I've made like 5 tutorial videos.  2 apply only to Half-Life²: Deathmatch, 2 apply only to Source games in general, and one applies to all Steam.  I think that even the most experienced among you should have a look- there are some things that very few people know!  Click the titles, they are links.  Or, go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9A9877E3DAE6CB67" class="postlink"><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:#0040FF">the tutorials playlist</span></span></strong></a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Thisismyrofl" class="postlink"><strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="color:#0040FF">my Channel</span></span></strong></a>.<br>

This is the one that you're most likely to know if you play HL2DM.  Just punt the combine ball [orb] after you shoot to make a fast combine ball.<br>

Really, I won't be surprised if you don't know this one.  You can EXACTLY recreate the logos from Half-Life², HL2DM, HL2EP1, HL2EP2, Garry's Mod, Day Of Defeat, and Counter-Strike using the fonts that came with them.  By the way, this is my first tutorial video (that is still up) so it's not HD.  By the way I remade it so it's nicer!  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"><br>

not to be disrespectfull to what you have done cuz helping people is always usefull. but the things you have shown are already been done years ago i think you should see some demo's and video's in this section yourself <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> they are pretty much amazing when it come's to tricks.. + you got so much deathmatch videos on youtube now a day. that are  pretty much the same i think your video's are a bit overated. what i mean is 99 % on this site already knows about this and the people that are new just visit the training course on this homepage seeing the video's you show above with even more tricks. like movement. cook nades. mag sniping. fast orbs. strategy's. <br>
<br>
as for the fonts i have to say that not alot of people know about this soy thats a good addition although you got tons of information site's on how to do this. but the video addition is cool</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

A quick search didn't find anything about custom music or changing the Steam message sound.  A lot of people know how to mag scope but not many know how to TOGGLE it.  And like you said, the font trick is relatively unknown.  I just figured I might as well add all my tutorials so I did.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The main trouble with doing it this way is you cannot control game and you music tracks levels seperately.  Also you have to make complicated scripts/binds to play them.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Which reminds me- I was considering making a video with 3 short audio tricks- muting (bind &lt;key&gt; "play 0"), volume control (bind kp_minus "incrementvar volume 0 1 -.25"; bind kp_plus "incrementvar volume 0 1 .25") and one more.  What was that last one?  Damn, I forget.

	<div class="content">I guess this forum is pretty dead... but meh, I'll post it anyways:<br>

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>»Яąẅ« Warrior wrote:[hr]So here we go again, another frag movie of the RaW team is being released! This movie contains kills performed by the RaW team during the past year and six months. A few frags are even older, but anyhow, it's all content that in some way highlights the best aspects of this game. No frags were staged, and all frags are made in scrim wars, 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3.<br>
Since this is a project done by two, both of us will now say a word of our own, starting with me:<br>
<br>
<em class="text-italics">When I first started making this project I had no idea about how much time it would cost me. I started this fragmovie on my own; I was a total noob and didn't really know anything about moviemaking. Although I got basic help by two friendly ones, SND and onty. <br>
<br>
After a while, A1 returned to the game, and we decided, since his earlier moviemaking experiences, that he would help me with the movie making, advice me and so on. With the time A1 got more and more involved into the project and we decided to split the work. A1 then started to make the intro, while I was going to make the frag part of the video <br>
<br>
When the intro was finnished, A1 continued to help me with the movie, sharing his creative thoughts and ideas, giving the word "effect" a meaning. I don't know what the movie would have been without A1, but I can at least say it wouldnt be what it is today without him. His creative  skills and knowledge is just amazing.  <br>
<br>
And today, a very long time after I first started working on the movie I, or now, we are finally done. I made what I wanted to do all along, a fragmovie, rather a team than a induvidual one. Enjoy!</em><br>

<br>
<em class="text-italics">When I heard about RaW frag vid and saw the first frag samplers Warrior made, I <br>
was totally fascinated. So AWESOME frags! I'm totally in!<br>
<br>
We started sending more demos to Warrior who did all the hard work with exporting them to avi. We weren't always agreeing which frags were the most awesome and should be included in the video but eventually we got a nice tight bunch of quality footage.<br>
<br>
Intro was very fun to create and I also made the effects on the movie. We shared our own opinions and ideas constantly and had really fun making this video.<br>
<br>
I'm really glad that I could be a part of creating this film and I hope you all enjoy our work.</em><br>

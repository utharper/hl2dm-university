	<div class="content">I read Holymoly's video guide, which is btw very well done, but I couldn't get the ingame video recording working.<br>
<br>
I built a movie.cfg from the <a href="http://www.hl2dm-university.com/hl2dm_105.htm" class="postlink">frag video fundamentals</a> University page and with that I can record a video. But many good functions are missing in this one and sometimes the sounds are badly recorded.<br>
<br>
With the holymoly's movie.cfg I can't get the .tga files generated.  <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> That's my main problem.<br>
Also I can't get the Sourctv functions working (small problem for now), like 3rd person view.<br>
<br>
There's these comands in the cfg file that make me think I should have some other files I don't have:<br>
<strong class="text-strong">alias "menu" "exec movie/menu.cfg"<br>
alias "sourcetv" "exec movie/sourcetvmenu.cfg<br>
exec movie/commandlock.cfg</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
Also, one doubt I have: I've noticed once in my autoexec.cfg that it had some mistakes happening in it's execution. I saved it in UFT-8 and everything worked fine afterwords. It was Unicode before. The same didn't happen with the movie.cfg, but, anyway, what's the correct codification to it? Or, does it make any diference?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

I was pressing F10 to "record avi" but after doing some reading I think you may be right:

Yea, I now found the .avi's, they are saved in the hl2dm's root, but they have pretty hazardous results. Chunk problems and the like.<br>
I rather use F11 and compile with Vdub.<br>

Indeed taking shots is a little bit more reliable I find, for starters it actualy works everytime unlike the other way which asks you to then select a codec (i use uncompressed) but sometimes the selection box fails to appear.<br>

Just press the buttons to see what they do it won't break your game.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

How is it possible to get spectator freedom in a demo? (without using the "drive" button of the demo UI)<br>
<br>
Does it have to be recorded by Source tv?<br>

<br>
But now, yet another thing came into my way:<br>
While I was experimenting with the demo smoother, I accidentaly loaded a demo in which someone else was playing while I spectated, and realized that the Drive button didn't work. Or rather.. it did work, but I couldn't get detached from the player view. In demos where it's me playing I can fly around, no problem.<br>
<br>
Is this normal?<br>
<br>
Cuz if it is it, then I got a problem.

Nah I wouldn't do that. First, instead of getting someone to record yourself, use sourcetv. It will be the same, and you will have many more views. Apart from that, 1st person view from source tv / spectator, is really smooth yeah, but totally inaccurate, and with several bugs (ever seen the gravity gun from spectator? :/ )<br>

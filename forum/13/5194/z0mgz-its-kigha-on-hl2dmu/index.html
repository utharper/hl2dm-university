<br>
Anyway, 2nd video. This was made ages ago, but I didn't feel like releasing it til now.<br>
If y'all like, it'll give me incentive to make a 3rd. But as of right now: <br>
I barely play nowadays. <br>
Quite a few people don't take too kindly of me.<br>
And last, the entire community as a whole in this game is just terrible. No offense.<br>
<br>
So my current motivational level is rather on the low side...<br>
<br>
If I get good feedback, I'll make the third. If dumbasses spam the thread, I'll probably... Not? <br>
Idc either way, here's the link for DL.<br>

<br>
Little over 300MB ... .wmv format. <br>
Don't bitch about file size, don't bitch about the compression method, don't bitch/whine at all, period.<br>

Well, I kind've meant personality wise. Not skill wise. And this comment of yours reflects that perfectly. <br>
Though, as a reply, I'd like to think of myself as one of the best, actually. Thanks.<br>

	<div class="content">I actually have no grudges against anyone in this community at all, apart from Blur and Studio at this point.<br>
Nor was I meaning to offend anyone, actually. The point of that statement being was to say that .. Well, bluntly put...<br>
Everyone I've met PERSONALLY on this game... Is a complete dick. To me, at least. When I've done absolutely nothing but try to be nice to people.<br>
So, as a result? Yes, of course I'm going to degrade the community as a whole. And this entire thread kind've further proves my point, again. <br>
I think people in this game, at least that I've seen, are some of the most immature beings I've ever met in my life. <br>
Furthermore, I only have "respect" for a few people, those being Luke, Confused, Nervous, FallingRain, (yes even still) and a few others who haven't gone all gh3y on me.<br>
Lastly, this may be just a game, and I shouldn't be taking it "too seriously" (which I'm not) but the point still stands that you should act a little more mature, this includes everyone. IE: This includes not getting to peoples personal lives that you clearly DON'T know the story behind, (nor will I even attempt to explain) and you should just play the game, talk about the game strictly, and that's about it. Unless you know someone personally, that is ALL it should be kept to, and all I'll actually talk about/care to explain.<br>
Either way, I think I may possibly make a third, cause I have high hopes for this game and sadly, it's community. Hopefully one day people in it will stop being morons.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Frankly, you seem to be a self obsessed narcissistic jerk to me. No one cares who you respect of whatever.<br>

I mean, really, dont say everyone is terrible or a complete jerk and then, you didn't mean to offend.<br>
Are you stupid or something?<br>

It's unseemly and creepy, the way you carry on.<br>

You suck... no offense!??~?~<br>
I don't even think you know WHAT you are talking about.<br>
How old are you,10?<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
EDIT- Let me suggest the problem is you. You talk about immature but you aren't mature enough to realize young folks like to bully or otherwise have fun with folks, at least some of them.<br>
Let me suggest you caused this problem by voicing your personal nonsense and allowing folks to use it against you.<br>
Also, after that happened, you didn't confront them strongly yourself but faded back, shrinking away.<br>
That lead to more lack of respect and shenanigans, that you COULD have headed off.<br>
<br>
Now you are very butthurt/emo/overwrought... fill in the blank.<br>
Suggest you realize this is the interwebs, not to take it all SO seriously yourself and stop expecting every young gamer to be a fucking Buddhist Monk.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The sad part is, you're right about that. I'm a pretty big hippie, I'll admit. lol. <br>
And yes, actually, I DO expect/long for people, even over the internet, to not act like complete idiots. <br>
Now that this thought/idea is completely useless to try and fulfill, it's not exactly harmful giving it a shot anyway, now is it? <br>
Also: Self-obsessed? Emo? You clearly don't know me even slightly... As all that crap up top doesn't reflect me at all, and actually isn't me. But like I said, it's a long story and I'm not going to explain it on this thread. I get to know people as individuals on this game, and talk to them personally, one on one, before I judge them. Which is what I WISH people would do with me, instead of acting kind've like you are now, which is insanely judgmental. However, the COMMUNITY as a WHOLE, is complete and utter trash. Anyone who denies that fact is... Just idiotic. I'm not saying anything about anyone in particular, but this whole game's community is horrific. I'm not going to stress that enough. <br>
<br>
But anyway, I apologize if I've offended you at all, which I clearly have... And I'd much rather us actually speak one on one before bashing the fuck out of each other. Thank you.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

But that's not Kigha. As she stated above it's not her, but you guys of course are gonna pull out the "BUT WE HAVE AIM LOGS AND SCREENSHOTS LULUL PWNT" but you're wrong. <br>
<br>
This is a complex situation beyond you. Jer poses as Kigha because he's a no-good troll just like the good majority of you posting in this thread. The difference between you and me is I actually listened to Kigha and thought, "Hey, she's actually telling the truth." yes, iirc Kigha has told some people she's a guy to get them off her back. Because nearly every person she explains it to says "LOL BUT ON THE UNIVERSITY THERE IS A LINK 2 MYSPACE LOL". Mmmhmm. But. That's not her. I'm just saying all this because I find it absolutely hilarious that you're all "Oh yeah we're Internet detectives. We figure it all out." but the thing is, you're dumb and ignorant and wrong. <br>

No, it's not hilarious actually.  You're being played like other kids before you.  All the evidence is there, right in front of you, but you'd rather not believe the truth.  And why would you rather believe the lie?  Because you have some vested interest in "her".  So maybe you're telling me the truth and you haven't sexed it up, but you've thought about it at least.  I'm sure you two have had some close and intimate conversations where she said something like: "I'm just so sick of this drama.  People won't leave me alone about this, but it's not my fault. &lt;random story for sympathy &gt;"  And you felt bad for her, and told her things would be ok, and that you're there for her.  So you go on believing that some asshole out there, used kigha's actual msn and aim names to forge accounts in not one or two places, but dozens of sites across the net.  And somehow, using those accounts, that she actually owns, managed to verify an account on all those sites.<br>

ya, you're prolly the chosen one.  lets see, Nervous left EE cause nobody was paying attention to him and is now friends Kigha who is so desprete for friends that he pretends to be a chick to cyber with a guy. then pretends to be a guy because ppl are harassing him.  all the while she claims that another guy puts pics of himself on the webz and says its really Kigha and he is trying to look like her.......?  <br>

well, you're right and wrong there. Yes, we have had conversations on more than just hl2dm, and we are close friends, I have gone to her for advice and things like that, so you're right there. But you're wrong where you say I'm interested in her. I don't Internet date, have never internet dated and never cared to, I have my own personal life away from the computer and I keep it that way. <br>
<br>
Second, though I do sometimes think you go overkill on the trolling people, you're not an ignorant fuck. But you never want to accept that it's possible that the "evidence" is invalid. So I'm sorry that I called you that. But you're saying that it's impossible that Jer would do it. It's not. And even if all odds were against Kigha i'd still believe her because, like I think Conflict said earlier, it's not really relevant. Who Kigha is is her business, and I'm going to believe the things Kigha says the same way I believe that Rico is a guy and Paradox is a girl. I'm not going to tell them to prove it. And even if there's a whole fiasco about it, who cares? I trust them. <br>
<br>
Dal, where did you lose me? When I said me trusting kigha = me sexing it up, it was sarcasm, because everyone seems to assume that. <br>
<br>
Chem: stfu already. Stop being a butthurt little bitch because I didn't like EE. You were one of the most racist annoying communities i was ever in. Just because I was friends with zach you guys gave me shit, some of you thought I rate hacked, and you were just plain unpleasant people in my perspective. I'm happy you don't feel that way and you can have fun over there at EE. but you should just leave me alone about it. I don't like EE because it's not for me.

That's all I needed to see. You see son when you to continue to grow up the more you realize you cannot even trust your own family the older you get. As an admin for only ONE season I have learned some people lie to you, constantly. But uhhh....yeah not sure what to say except continue to be an e-hero for a pretend girl, that later admitted was a guy, but then later admitted he was a girl only after deleting most of the former websites I got to see as well that pretty much showed he was a he.<br>

I know.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Mr. Nervous wrote:</cite>you never want to accept that it's possible that the "evidence" is invalid.</div></blockquote>
No, because I know how forum validation works.  Kigha's actually aim and msn accounts were used to make those accounts.  It wasn't very smart on his part, now he's busted, and it's time for him to own up to it.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Mr. Nervous wrote:</cite>So I'm sorry that I called you that.</div></blockquote>
I'm a big boy.  I can take it.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Mr. Nervous wrote:</cite>i'd still believe her because, like I think Conflict said earlier, it's not really relevant.</div></blockquote>
When someone is faking a persona in order to deceive people I believe it is relevant.  If kigha is gay, straight, bi, transgender, that's irrelevant, but lying about it, and creating wild stories in order to win your sympathy and trust, well, that's just shitty.  So when he comes into this forum, calls everyone "terrible", and expects us to check out his video, and just ignore a pot-kettle-black situation that's been placed right in front of us, it's just not happening.<br>

<blockquote><div><cite>Mr. Nervous wrote:</cite>Who Kigha is is her business, and I'm going to believe the things Kigha says the same way I believe that Rico is a guy and Paradox is a girl.

This is called "willful ignorance".  You had rather believe him than looking at the evidence and making your own decision.<br>
No one questions me or Paradox because it's obvious that we are who we say we are.  Kigha's gender wasn't even a question until someone else who was close to her started to suspect something and mentioned it to me.  He's the person that provided much of the info that I have, and he didn't do it to hurt anyone, troll, or be just plain mean, he did it because he felt he was being lied to and wanted to find answers.<br>
At this point, Nervous, I'm not trying to bash you.  As hard as it may be, sometimes you have to accept the fact that people (even those close to you) lie.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

The guy driving is Jeff<br>
Jer aka Kigha is the one sitting in the backseat with the camera. He is also the one with the lowest voice. Also, he's really really good at DDR games.<br>
<br>
At 2:14 he gets a text from "Richard HL2"<br>
At 7:58 Jer gets a highscore on his iphone and puts in the name kigha, after which the guy in the front calls him by the name "kigha".<br>
He then gives the iphone to the guy in the front and makes some comments further confirming the the iphone does infact belong to Jer.<br>

	<div class="content">Well, as a half-decent response... Yes, actually. I DO "expect" you morons to just let this whole thing pass by. Because it's just a game. lol. <br>
I'm never going to associate with any single one of you outside of this game, probably ever again after I quti. *CHEER IN JOY!! HURRAY!!!!*<br>
Thus, I personally really don't.. Give a fuck. At all. lol. At this point, Nervous is probably the only one I care to explain ANYTHING to, and I still don't tell him everything, for personal reasons you idiots wouldn't understand, nor care to. However, I will admit you were pretty good at finding all this dumb info, and I'd also like to mention that you all need something called a life... Outside of the computer.. Something called daylight, try it.<br>
Furthermore: All that "evidence," as Nervous mentioned multiple times, isn't me. But it's basically impossible to try and explain the situation, as you're all thick-headed, idiotic dumbasses. I kind've started out trying to be nice and kind, and just word things less insultingly, but it really makes no different whether I do or not with this "terrible" community. Cause in all honesty, it's true. This game's community is fucking HORRIBLE. You're all idiots. I know more than everyone of you. I am a genius. I am better at the game than all of you. I'm faster, smarter, better. Period. <br>
Lastly: You all need to just let it the fuck go, and just play. That is all.<br>

Do I really need to link everyone to the screenshot of how you did against Xs? Xs is mid-lower-tier division 1 material and you got destroyed by them. Its fair to say you are terrible, you're a habitual liar (you lied to Luke about many things incuding your age, and now you're taking down nervous), your living in your own demented world and in general no one is gonna like you after this. <br>

hahahahahhahaha, i find it funny how everyone thinks I cyber with Kigha or that i'm in a relationship or something. This is the internet. it's not my personal life. the most involved i am with anyone on the internet it to the point of friends, so you can keep waiting for these non-existent cyber-logs, i'm sure that'll be the most interesting thing that's happened to you in recent history, since you've got no life.<br>

Actually, it technically is EXACTLY the players fault in the first place, believe it or not. If people would've just minded their own business and stayed out of personal shit, mine AND EVERYONE elses, none of this would've happened. However, I WILL openly admit I am, indeed, a compulsive liar. It's quite the disorder to have, and it sort've sucks. But hey, what can ya do, eh? Gender isn't relevant to the game, imo.

So you don't think that your first post in which you bashed the community started this dilemma you're in?  Denial is a bitch I suppose.<br>

Gender isn't relevant to the game, but it is to those with whom you build relationships - even if those relationships are separated by a keyboard and hundreds of miles of wire.  The problem here is that you don't care enough about your online friends to be yourself and tell the truth.  Your friends obviously don't want to be deceived, so why continue the charade?</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Rico, as always sums it up nicely but i don't understand how your personal chat, posing as a girl, got out. How could players be minding your business in a private chatroom!?!?<br>
<br>
And you say you are a compulsive liar. I married one, and the only thing worse is a murderer/rapist. That is definitely a personality defect, so i am right about you.<br>
Most of the folks here, including me, are not butthurt about anything. We are being entertained. <br>

<br>
obviously you are a completely fucked up individual, you have a indentity issue and a passion for lying.  time after time you say how terrible this community is, how we are all idiots and horrible ppl.  you constantly insuate that you are better then us on a personal level.  all of that is fine by me, you are intitled to your opinions, here's what i dont get.  this is the second time, that i know of, that you have publically embarrased a member of this community.  what you did to luke is certainly one of the most fucked up things ive ever seen anybody do in this community.  now you are dragging nervous through the mud as well.  as much as i dont like nervous, i cant help but feel bad for him that he got sucked into your web of bullshit.  all the while you state that this is just a game and we shouldnt dwell in personal lives, but its apperent that you get involved in ppl's personal lives a lot, with the intention of fucking them over.  so......how can you say we are a terrible community and honestly think you are better than us after doing this shit?<br>
<br>
and maybe this was your goal all along, to hurt the community thru this and to get ppl to rage at you.  that way you will get some attention.  but then you state that luke and nervous are among the ppl here that you respect??  your contradictions are everyway.<br>

Richard is FallingRain.<br>
<br>
Kigha is obviously a guy who wants to be a girl and pretends to be a girl on the internet. If you continue to believe that Kigha is a girl, you're retarded, in the most literal sense of the word. The pictures of Kigha-girl and Kigha-guy have the exact same facial structure, jawline, and mouth shape. All that's different is some make-up.<br>
<br>
Further, the idea that someone is posing as Kigha in youtube videos, using his/her e-mail to register for things, posting about bands, etc... is so incredibly far-fetched any person with gray matter between their ears knows it is false. Kigha-girl and Kigha-guy share the same musical interests, and are in the same band. Kigha sent me a drop.io pack of songs from his/her band, and got super offended when I didn't like the guy singer's voice. <br>
<br>
In short, Kigha is a guy - a very disturbed individual - who obviously feels caged in by his own body and wants to be a girl on the internet. There's no use in getting pissed about it. Fucked up people do fucked up shit.<br>
<br>
If you still believe that Kigha is a girl, Nervous, I have a boat I'd like to sell you. It's made of gold and is on the moon. I'll let you have it, though, if you give me all your money.<br>
<br>
Also, Kigha - vid sucks.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

	<div class="content">Well, first off, I'd like to explain that I DO respect Luke, even still. He hasn't really done anything wrong, nor did I leak out any conversations to "embarrass" him. <br>
Personally, I really have no clue why that's being brought up any longer, as Nervous and I have no more-than-friend connections on any scale. <br>
I don't plan on bringing him down in any manner at all, unless you call him sticking up for / defending me as bringing him down, in which case you're just retarded. <br>
You people can assume all that you want, which is fine. You've found quite a lot of info, but there's also quite a lot of shit you don't know about, and never will.<br>
Secondly, I'll admit, once again, I am a rather... Disturbed person, I guess you could say. I openly admitted that to anyone who asked, just not in a public place. And this is precisely why. I have major MAJOR issues/problems/disorders, plenty of them. It's not really a secret to anyone who asks. And I tell people these issues without a problem, yet I can't give a definite answer as to my gender, or something similar of small value. And the point stands, why? I just don't think it's relevant, at all. <br>
Furthermore:I am a guy. Hurr durrr. I'm fully quitting HL2DM after this summer anyway, I'm getting into another game / focusing more on other things. So... Hurrayyyy for that. <br>
This'll be the last post, as well. And I suppose I apologize for everything I've done to everyone, the community, and everything, I guess. So... Yep. ♥</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

its being brought up cause you faded into the shadows during that whole thing while Luke got torn up.  you're right he didnt do anything wrong and now its your turn to get embarrassed.  and its too late, you already brought nervous down, he is going to be tainted with this shit forever in this community.  you put a decent kid into a messed up situation because he was stupid enough to believe you.  he did stick up for you, and got the shit end of the stick for it.  i cant imagine how much shit would be dug up if nervous was still in EE.<br>

Secondly, I'll admit, once again, I am a rather... Disturbed person, I guess you could say. I openly admitted that to anyone who asked, just not in a public place. And this is precisely why. I have major MAJOR issues/problems/disorders, plenty of them. It's not really a secret to anyone who asks. And I tell people these issues without a problem, yet I can't give a definite answer as to my gender, or something similar of small value. And the point stands, why? I just don't think it's relevant, at all. <br>
Furthermore:I am a guy. Hurr durrr. I'm fully quitting HL2DM after this summer anyway, I'm getting into another game / focusing more on other things. So... Hurrayyyy for that. <br>
This'll be the last post, as well. And I suppose I apologize for everything I've done to everyone, the community, and everything, I guess. So... Yep. ♥</div></blockquote>

	<div class="content">Hmmm well this turned out rather... well?<br>
<br>
If you guys think I never doubted Kigha you're wrong. I found all those pages that you guys found, every one of them, and confronted Kigha with it. and she just said that Jer hacked her aim account and everything blah blah, and that she never bothered changing the password blah blah. You can ask Kigha, i stopped worrying about the gender a long time ago because it was just stressing me out and annoying me. I think that's bullshit, that Kigha would have never changed the password or anything. Kigha even told me that she has access to that youtube account with that video, but why she never took it down is beyond me. Kigha also says they're in the same band, and whatever. I find everything to be ridiculously far-fetched, but Kigha did send me a picture with the name Nervous written on a piece of paper and her face in it, which posed to further confuse me, which is when I decided to just fuck it and defend Kigha if people were trolling. The only time Kigha and I talk are during 1v1s or whatever, and that never goes beyond a "are you okay" if they seem like they aren't or just playing around and talking. While it does piss me off that the story is so far-fetched, it proved to be making me rather angry/deceived/whatever when I wasn't sure I should be or not.<br>
<br>
Say what you want, but I don't really care much anymore. Chem, i still think you see me as that 12 year old who came onto the EE forums and said "Hi my name is Mr. nervous, im 12 years old and i like playing hl2dm!!11!!1!! I want to be the best!" because I thought Sgt. Pepper was super cool on the HCC killbox server. To those people who are like "if you still think Kigha is a girl then you're a retard" (namely holymoly) - I don't really worry whether or not Kigha is a girl or a guy because we don't really talk much. the only reason I still play this game is 1) to play eFPS and 2) to keep TPA alive and kicking. I play other games more and Kigha is also moving on to other games so I don't really worry about the bullshit drama much. I just came to this thread and defended Kigha because I knew old man stalkers like Blas and Big Cheese would find some of the things I did and declare it official, Kigha was a guy. But w.e, that's over now, and I could really care less if you guys think Kigha is a guy, a girl, a robot, or anything else for that matter.<br>

Uhh.. I don't understand why you think that I am so concerned with what this forum thinks of me. "he is going to be tainted with this shit forever in this community". by that you mean --&gt; "Hey aren't you that guy that thought Kigha was a girl?" me: "Yah." them: "Oh lololol you're dumb bro, and gay." me: "Cool story bro."<br>

It's okay guys, having erotic relationship *(online of course)* with another man doesn't exactly make you gay. I'm happy for you two as you have finally came to the realization that Kigha has a penis. As for nervous I hope him finding out that he lost his e-virginity to a man does not negatively effect him in the long run. If you run into problems in the future I advise you to see a child/family counselor (ask Deathbite for a referral).</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

PB is trash. nospreads and bots, never versed Death, and judging by that video, Shunny is absolutely horrific. <br>
I didn't bother looking at the date, cause personally, Idc. I just know I'm better, that's all. Always have been, always will be.<br>
Also: Idk why Blur's raging at Nervous... Everyone knows Blur hacks, so his thoughts/opinions/kills/advice/existence matter not even in the slightest degree. <br>

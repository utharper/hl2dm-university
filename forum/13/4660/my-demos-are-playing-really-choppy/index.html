I've found when I play on certain servers, such as the xs ones it tends to have a really choppy effect on the demo, but when I play on the Synergy ones I don't have this problem as much, there still is a little, but not as bad. Try a different server first and if that doesn't solve the problem it might be a hardware issue (Typically the HD)</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

To be honest, I dont think its a settings thing, I think it has to do with the servers hardware / connection. Just my experience though.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

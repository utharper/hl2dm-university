	<div class="content">I and my clan have decided to make a clan video. We got a structure and music go with it. <br>
<br>
This is pretty much new to me and really like to sink my teeth into it but I want to make sure i get the basics right and get all the raw material together before i go crazy with. <br>
<br>
I downloaded the guides from the uni site which is pretty useful. But im having trouble using smooth in my pure 2 source tv demos. I can only move the camera around  the model but not move it freely like i want to like in the css video tutorial. If anyone can help with that that will be great.<br>
<br>
Also im concerned with that my view in my demos and source tv appears to my view a bit jerky and also my aim is well off the target in some shots where i pull a quick headshot. Im not sure its me or how the source tv records it seems to have a trouble record my quick movement the mouse.</div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->

Lemme see...<br>
Source tv records as spectator, so unless you want 3rd view shots, I would never advice you to use it for first person view. For your frags use your personal demo, and the source tv for recams and stuff.<br>
About the aim being off the target...yeah that's common, specially when you have high ping ...demo doesn't record very good in those cases.<br>
I try to avoid those shots in which it looks ridiculous, but sometimes you can include shots in which it seems you didn't hit ( I've used them in my LsD video, seen them on Gatman's video, on $W 's video, and many more, so don't worry <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=";)" title="Wink"> )<br>
Now ... follow holy's guide carefully ...it's very important.<br>
To "simplify" it... I'll kinda tell you quick and fast what you need to do.<br>
Use another account to be more comfortable. Get the movie config there. Record frags @ 30 fps (unless you want slow motions). Then get the .TGA files together with the sound using virtual dub. After that you will have many many clips (for each frag) that are REALLY heavy (about 200mb or even 1 gb, depeding on the resolution and lenght).<br>
When you have all that, use a program like vegas to edit everything, then render and compress the final version.<br>
That's quickly explained... if you need anything at all, don't doubt to contact me by pm, email, or steam... I'll be more than glad to help <img class="smilies" src="../../../images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"></div>	<!-- END MESSAGE -->
